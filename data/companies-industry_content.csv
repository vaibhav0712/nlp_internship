Bâton Rouge aims to become the standard for tailor-made lipsticks in Europe,"Premium Beauty News - Bâton Rouge celebrated its second anniversary last December. What is your take on the early stages of this adventure? Christelle Percheron - The results are very encouraging, with growth of +200% between 2022 and 2023 and a six-figure turnover. We sold more than 10,000 lipsticks in 2023 and more than 4,000 gift cards between the end of November and the end of December 2023. As we have seen, Bâton Rouge is an experience that can be shared: we welcome many duos, groups of girlfriends and even professional events. Today, our tiny 24 sq. m. boutique, although perfectly optimised, is saturated, as is our booking calendar. There is a two-month waiting list. But as we have some no-shows, it is always possible to try your luck without an appointment and be looked after. We have recently hired an additional make-up artist to meet growing demand, but indeed, it is the opening of a second outlet that will unclog the books and enable us to welcome even more people. Premium Beauty News - What progress! And so in 2024, a second boutique is due to open in Paris... Christelle Percheron - Absolutely! We are actively looking for premises in the Saint-Germain-des-Prés district that would be three times the size of our first shop in the Marais district. We are hoping to open it this summer, before the 2024 Olympics, otherwise, it will be for next autumn. With this second outlet in Paris, we will be able to welcome a lot more groups of more than five people - for hen parties or birthdays - for which requests are constantly increasing. Today, we have to turn them away. This new venue will also enable us to develop business events (team building, press relations...), which currently account for 10% of our sales. Premium Beauty News - What is your analysis of lip make-up trends? Christelle Percheron - What I can say is that in 2023, we sold as many liquid lipsticks as solid ones. We noticed a preference for gloss during the spring-summer season and for matte liquid in autumn-winter. Satin, on the other hand, enjoys constant success all year round. For their creations, around 80% of visitors choose a scented version. The strawberry-blackberry fragrance is by far the most popular! As far as colours are concerned, it is a bit hard to say. What I have noticed is that there are two major trends: on the one hand, red, which is available in an infinite variety of shades, and on the other, nude, to enhance the natural colour of the lips, which is unique to each person. Premium Beauty News - Are there any innovations in the pipeline? Christelle Percheron - We will be launching new pearlescent and glitter pigments in September. In addition, ready-to-use lip pencils are under development for release at the end of 2024. We aim to offer pencils with ultra-clean ingredients, just like the rest of our range. We pay particular attention to the sourcing of our ingredients to guarantee formulas with a high percentage of naturalness. Castor oil is the main ingredient in our lipsticks and our fragrances are 100% natural, allergen-free and Ecocert certified. Finally, in terms of service, we are planning to introduce an engraving system for our cases to take personalisation one step further. Premium Beauty News - What are your future areas of development? Christelle Percheron - Our ambition is to become the standard for made-to-measure lipsticks in Europe. To this end, we plan to open our first boutique outside France next year, in London; we will start looking in September, focusing our efforts in the Covent Garden area. Milan is also a priority for us and it will probably be the city chosen for our fourth opening. In addition, we are currently working on the design of a moulding machine with 500 cavities, to offer series of hand-made lipsticks to a B-to-B clientele. We have already received several requests from brands in the ready-to-wear, hygiene and food sectors to create a series of lipsticks personalised with their brand image in small quantities. Our packaging suppliers are very agile, which means we can offer, in addition to the choice of the grape or liquid colour, a customised pack by changing its colour, for example, or by integrating a logo to take co-creation to the limit."
Adopt Parfums to open 15 stores in Spain by December 2024,"“Adopt Parfums did not exist ten years ago [2], and five years ago, the brand-chain was almost unknown,” reminds Frédéric Stoeckel. Today, one Adopt fragrance is sold every two seconds worldwide, in around 40 countries: 10 million bottles sold in France in 2023, 15 million in the rest of the world. According to the CEO, this success is embodied in “a concept that meets consumer expectations. Some people are total fans. In France, a Facebook group for ‘fans of Adopt perfumes’ was even created. It currently counts over 13,500 members”, explains the brand’s chairman. The brand’ major strength is that it offers fragrances at highly affordable prices: a 30-ml bottle sells for 10.95 euros. “It makes it possible for consumers to change fragrances according to their moods and desires. It is a way of consuming that is totally in tune with the times, and without breaking the bank. To achieve this, we mainly focus on the quality of the juice and offer it in simple containers with no frills and no overpackaging, which helps cut costs considerably”, says Frédéric Stoeckel. The brand, which currently has 240 stores in France, has just opened a subsidiary in Spain to replicate its business plan across the Pyrenees. “Today, we have one store in Barcelona and one in Madrid, and they are both doing really well! We aim to open 15 in Spain by the end of 2024”, says the CEO. Belgium will also welcome its first Adopt Parfums stores in 2024. “As for Asia, we have been pursuing our digital strategy in China and duplicated it in Taiwan. Finally, this year we are testing the arrival of Adopt Parfums in Canada”, he adds. “Juice above all: that has really been our top priority since 2019, when I became the head of the company. Today, we work with major perfumers to create our fragrances. We launch about 20 every year,” explains Frédéric Stoeckel. The next three launches will feature Indian jasmine and tiare flower, both sourced from sustainable ingredient chains that the company supports through partnerships, including with perfume creation companies. The former will be at the core of L’Or Blanc, an eau de parfum created by Firmenich perfumer Amandine Clerc-Marie, due for release for Mother’s Day, in May 2024. Two more fragrances will follow in June: Tahiti Paradis for women, and Blackstone for men: both feature Firmenich’s unique tiare flower absolute. These two olfactory creations were designed by Coralie Spicher and Fabrice Pellegrin. Finally, since the end of 2023, Adopt Parfums has been offering customers a new 50-ml bottle to offer intense versions of the brand’s best-sellers."
"“Our customers are strongly concerned about packaging” Annie Jackson, Credo","Leila Rochet - How did your journey into Beauty unfold, leading to your role today as CEO of Credo? Annie Jackson - We started on the concept for Credo back in 2013 and opened our first store in 2015. We just opened our 16th location. We are a physical retail concept. While digital is very important to any business today, Credo was created by meeting customers where they are, in neighborhoods where people are living a healthy lifestyle, exercising, and investing in their health. We want people to be able to explore and find new brands, try the products, and work with our estheticians and makeup artists. And that’s our continued focus. Back in 2013, we took the cue from the organic food movement. So we were curious, could we find enough brands to fill our first store in San Francisco. We started with about 60 brands and we have 105 today. About a quarter of those brands we started with are still with us a decade later. Leila - There must have been a lot of challenges when you started. How do they compare to the challenges you face today? Annie - When we started we had this ecosystem of brands which were really celebrating finding a retail partner and wanted to grow alongside us. The customer base has now grown so much that these brands are scaling and growing into bigger retailers. The fact that retailers with a larger footprint than Credo are committed to putting safer products on their shelves is an amazing thing. But from a business standpoint, it becomes quite challenging because that hurts our market share. It’s a tricky one. Yet, it hasn’t made us any less passionate about what we do. We are striving to make a positive impact in the beauty industry and so we’re often shoulder to shoulder with our competitors - Sephora, Ulta, Detox Market, and others. But you know, we’re all in this together. And I think the more we can band together to make better choices for human health, it’s a good thing. Leila - How do you make sure that the products that you sell in your retailers are the safest ones? Annie - Before, we were manually checking products against our standard, but today we use a technology platform called Novi. We’ve also invested in a rock star team of impact specialists who come from environmental, toxicology, and science backgrounds, to help guide us. Today,  what we’re doing as an organization is questioning if there could be a better way. For us, the secret sauce is finding brands that are not just meeting our standards, they’re exceeding them, or they have a path to exceed. What makes me so proud of the brand community that we have is that these people have rolled up their sleeves and done the hard work - they’re paying more money, and they’re taking more time to bring products to market. And they’re challenging the contract manufacturing community to look at other ingredients and explore other options. Leila - How do you help your consumers navigate all these changes and what are you seeing as their priority? Annie - From the outset, our customers have always been concerned about packaging. In the early days, while we vetted brands against a restricted substance list, consumers were always saying, “I hate all this plastic!”. Customers are absolutely invested in being part of the solution. We co-founded the packaging collection program Pact Collective along with other stakeholders, but we also have the conversation on the selling floor about what is recyclable. The next thing that’s top of mind for us is looking at ingredients that have no data and examining the assumption that they’re safe or good for you. So we’re starting to dig into that with Chem Forward, who are a non-profit partner. It may mean that some products at Credo go away, but, you know, that’s why we’re here and that’s the work that we’re doing today. Leila - According to Nielsen IQ - 61% of US consumers associate sustainability with benefiting the planet, while just 26% associate it with societal contributions. Credo has been active on matters like ethical sourcing of mica, do you see ethical transparency as the next step for the industry? Annie - Yes, I do. I think whether people are buying beauty products, or beer, or cars, they are much more invested in finding out information before they choose a product. And so it could be a source of ingredients, it could be packaging, it could be what a founder says on social media… it could be all of those pieces together. Gen Z has the highest bar of any customer out there, and they expect you to have all these things in place. They want the product to be all those things, with an entry-level price point, and a cool look and feel. They want it all. And that generation is growing up, they’ve got more spending power, and those are the brands that they’re looking for. So I think it’s a super exciting time. Leila - What tools and techniques do you use to educate consumers? Annie - We want our sales associates to know our brands intimately, so we spend most of our time on education, in terms of brand and product knowledge, but also on what our standards are. Leila - In a previous interview, you talked about moving “beyond clean beauty”, can you explain what you mean by this? Annie - It’s really about moving beyond the restricted substance list, and understanding that the customer has embraced a much more holistic view of what clean or green beauty means to them. It involves packaging, people, ethics… just real transparency. I can say from experience that Beauty is a pretty opaque industry, and it’s not inherently forthcoming about what’s in products, and who the people are that these brands are working with. By no means does Credo have everything figured out perfectly, but we’re digging into things that should be very transparent to the customer. That’s what people expect today. When I was talking about going beyond clean, it is because people tend to hear “clean beauty”, and they just think of ingredients, and that’s it. But we’re embarking on meeting our first sustainable packaging milestone this year, where our brand partners needed to reach 50% or greater PCR content. We put that out in the universe in 2020 and that’s where we’ve been spending most of our time. From an ingredients standpoint, it’s much more cut and dry, like, do you have these ingredients, or don’t you? But on the packaging front, it’s really been us linking arms with our brand partners and saying, we got to do better. We have to at the end of the day. The reality is we’re in an industry where we sell products, and so if you’re going to do that then let’s invest in things that are just better for people and the planet."
"“Coty brought perfume into the modern age”, Jean Holtzmann, CBO, Coty","Premium Beauty News - How do you define the notions of boldness and innovation at Coty? Jean Holtzmann - This year, Coty is celebrating 120 years of unique expertise in the perfume market. It is worth remembering that it was Coty that really brought perfume into the modern age. By combining the first synthetic molecules with the finest ingredients of natural origin, Coty unleashed creativity, opening up new, yet unexplored olfactory territories. Coty’s Ambre Antique (1905) or Chypre (1917) fragrances are at the origin of two of the largest contemporary olfactory families, which now account for almost two-thirds of the women’s fine fragrance segment in key markets: the oriental-amber family and the Chypre family. Our extraordinary heritage has never ceased to guide us in innovation, and we express it through the creativity and boldness of our fragrance formulas. Since then, Coty has always endeavoured to create a portfolio of iconic fragrances, including CK One, Chloé Signature, Gucci Bloom, Boss Bottled, and the very recent Burberry Goddess, which stands out with its three powerful vanillas. More than ever, the launch of Infiniment Coty Paris reflects our vision of tomorrow’s perfumery, where nature, science and art intertwine to reinvent the exceptional heritage on which we and the entire industry are founded. Premium Beauty News - Why choose a bold formula? Jean Holtzmann - At Coty, innovation is present throughout the value chain of perfume creation. In the formulas, of course, and in the quality of the juices developed by our olfactory studio and the greatest noses on the market: they can render into scent the great aspirations that run through society, while revealing the identity of each of our brands. Then comes the bottle, which mirrors the essence of our fragrances, as evidenced by La Rose Jacqueminot, Coty’s first perfume (1904), sublimated in a magnificent Baccarat bottle; Chloé Signature, a glass representation of the fashion company’s iconic pleated sunburst; or Daisy by Marc Jacobs, with its novel fantasy cap, shaped as daisy petals of different sizes. We are also working on bold campaigns in the vein of the group’s raison d’être – Undefine Beauty – which are aimed to break free from beauty and olfactory archetypes, and in particular to review the very definition of the word “beauty” in dictionaries, to better reflect the deep aspirations of all individuals. The Goddess campaign, for Burberry’s latest women’s perfume, highlights a powerful, inspiring woman who is the subject of her own life. It is an eloquent illustration of this. Premium Beauty News - How do you work on innovation, in-house and with your suppliers? Jean Holtzmann - Innovation infuses each of Coty’s high skills. Our collegial organization helps us anticipate and meet key consumer expectations, thanks to the constant interactions between each of our areas of expertise in perfume creation. It gives us great agility in managing projects and expressing our innovation. We collaborate and co-create with the best suppliers and partners to support the major stages of innovation. For example, thanks to our partnership with LanzaTech, we can now include alcohol derived from carbon capture in our fragrance portfolio. This strong commitment emphasizes the fact that sustainable development is a major driver of innovation. Premium Beauty News - How do you see the perfume market evolving? Jean Holtzmann - The fragrance market is in turmoil and the trend we call the “Fragrance Effect” at Coty is still going strong. The successive lockdowns have changed the game, and countries such as China, which until now was not a key perfume market, are becoming the new growth drivers. The market is becoming more premium. It is time to create powerful, signature, high-performance formulas. Perfume is also a vehicle for positive emotions in a difficult, often anxiety-provoking global context. Innovative, authentic, quality brands capable of positively fuelling the global conversation on this increasingly popular category will come out on top. Premium Beauty News - How does the use of recycled alcohol derived from converted carbon fit into the Coty portfolio? Jean Holtzmann - Innovation to transform CO2 emissions into ethanol, which we purify to add it to our fragrance formulas, is a technological revolution exclusive to the Coty Group. It is part of our Beauty that lasts sustainability roadmap. Today, the 14 fragrances of the Infiniment Coty brand, as well as Gucci The Alchemist’s Garden’s Where my heart beats perfume, contain 100% of recycled alcohol derived from this new technology. Within two years, the majority of Coty perfumes will incorporate this new ethanol, in part or in full. This is in response to consumer demand for increasingly environmentally-friendly products. Premium Beauty News - What about Molecular Aura, the technology behind the new Infiniment Coty Paris collection? Jean Holtzmann - Infiniment Coty Paris, the group’s new eponymous high perfumery brand, embodies all the great advances of Coty’s research. For example, the fragrance formulas incorporate a new Coty patent-pending technology, Molecular Aura, which modifies the evaporation profile of raw materials and preserves the fragrance’s character for up to 30 hours. Acting like a magnet, Molecular Aura slows down the disappearance of certain notes or intensifies others. A jasmine note will keep its fresh facets for longer, as if in full bloom. It is a radical change compared to the traditional definition of the “olfactory pyramid”, and a new approach to composing with perfumers. Premium Beauty News - Do you think the perfume industry can reinvent itself through technological innovation? Jean Holtzmann - Coty has been revolutionizing the beauty industry for over a century. Proud of our pioneering and avant-garde spirit, we are convinced that passion and science are formidable levers of innovation. Thanks to our international R&D Centre of Excellence, based in Switzerland and focused on perfume, the Coty Group is pursuing its mission: constantly opening up new olfactory horizons. We are currently working on a wide range of subjects to meet the expectations of our consumers, always on the lookout for ever more innovative, high-performance, environmentally friendly fragrances. With over a century of expertise in perfumes, we are committed to being the most innovative olfactory creation platform on the market."
Eau Thermale Jonzac strengthens organic dermo-cosmetics positioning,"Driven by the dynamic hygiene and beauty market, which is particularly strong in pharmacy channels (+10.2% in value in 2023), and despite the slowdown in organic market sales, the Eau Thermale Jonzac brand has maintained its growth at +38% over the past five years, with a turnover of EUR 22 million – and forecasts predict EUR 40 million for 2027. Against this backdrop, the company is migrating its product offering towards the world of dermocosmetics, particularly in pharmacies. “We have already embraced all the codes of dermocosmetics, and we are moving our shelf positioning from the organic to the dermocosmetics pharmacy departments”, says Sales Director Elie Saad. “Dermatologists are much reassured to know there is an offering that provides the same efficacy and safety as other dermocosmetics brands, but with an extra argument, that of naturalness. That is what is driving pharmacists to make a change to their shelves”, continues Fanny Spriet, Cosmetics Communications Director. Eau Thermale Jonzac currently has 1,600 pharmacies as part of the 4,000 points of sale in its distribution network in France, and aims to reach 3,000 within the next two years. The brand’s positioning combines three key elements: the Jonzac thermal spring water and its skin benefits, naturalness, with 99% of ingredients of natural origin and an organic certification, and the codes of dermocosmetics. And to be even more in tune with this world, they started to revamp the visual identity in 2023. “We wanted to boost the perception of our technical expertise and efficacy through recognized market codes to fully express our dermocosmetics positioning”, says Fanny Spriet. The new product design is currently being rolled out across all ranges and comes with a revamping of the communication visuals. “We still have plenty of potential to increase the brand’s visibility and recruit new consumers, in particular through investment in communications”, adds the Director. Over the past 13 years, the brand has developed ranges for all types of skin problems, including skin repair and atopic conditions. It has also positioned itself in the anti-ageing segment with the Sublimactive range, created in 2012 and now completely revamped, with new formulas and test results. The concept of the 2024 version of the Sublimactive range is based on a dual action on both wrinkles and the microbiome, through a patented complex, the thermal microbiome, combining a postbiotic contributing to the skin’s microbial balance, lactobacillus acidophilus, and Jonzac thermal spring water, as well as a red algae with anti-wrinkle functions. The Sublimactive routine is made up of six products: a serum, a rich cream, a light cream, a night cream, an eye contour cream, and micellar water in small and large sizes, with prices ranging from EUR 3.90 to EUR 33.90 for the Concentrated Firming Serum, a new product in the range. The launch will be supported by a series of actions in pharmacies, as well as a TV and digital campaign, starting from April 23rd. Currently present in 29 countries, mainly in Europe, Eau Thermale Jonzac, which currently generates less than 10% of its turnover outside France, aims to conquer new markets. “As part of our strategy, it is a very important area of development for the next three to ten years, because this offering has a lot of potential, in particular in Asia”, remarks Fanny Spriet. Some of the references were launched a few weeks ago in the United States. “While our domestic ambitions are 10% a year, we are aiming for 30% to 35% globally, so we should reach approximately 9 to 10 million over the next seven or eight years”, concludes Elie Saad."
Evoluderm celebrates 20th anniversary and transitions towards naturalness,"Premium Beauty News - In 20 years, Evoluderm has become a leading brand in the affordable hygiene and beauty industry. What is the recipe for success? Gabriel Aiach - Since we founded Evoluderm in 2004, our top priority has remained unchanged: offering consumers French hygiene and beauty products at reasonable prices. We achieve this by optimizing all purchases: raw materials, packaging, a limited number of suppliers, etc. And we innovate! Evoluderm now counts over 225 products, divided into four categories – hair, face, body, and baby – and structured around key ingredients. In 2006, we launched our argan range and its shampoo, which is one of our best-sellers now. In 2014, to speed up the pace of our launches, we set up our own R&D laboratory, which we expanded in 2023. Then, 2015 saw the arrival of our micellar waters. Today, we sell one every 30 seconds worldwide. In 2020, during the pandemic, we made a major contribution to the production of hand sanitizer gels. Finally, in 2023, we launched our first serums, including the vitamin C serum, which was the fifth best-selling serum at the end of the year. Lastly, as soon as 2019, we decided to provide consumers with the naturalness rate of our products. By 2025, we intend to offer at least 95% of ingredients of natural origin in 90% of our formulas. In addition, since 2020, 85% of our catalogue has been vegan, and we aim for 100% by 2025. Premium Beauty News - How are you going to celebrate the brand’s 20th anniversary?  Nathalie Aiach - Evoluderm’s 20th anniversary is a great celebration that will take place throughout 2024. We have created a special logo that can be found on our communication materials. Until the end of the year, our eight bestsellers will be adorned with illustrations featuring Evoluderm women. Our advertizing campaign will start in April with a TV ad, followed by a poster campaign in Paris, in the metro and on buses, during the first half of 2024. We are currently finalizing the logistics for our flagship event: it will involve setting up trailers in different parts of Paris to meet our consumers. We also want to open the company’s doors, so they can see behind the scenes how their favourite products are made. Premium Beauty News - What does Evoluderm have in store for us in terms of product launches? Nathalie Aiach - At Cosmoprof, we showcased our brand new vitamin C range consisting of a serum released last year, a micellar water, a fabric mask, a cleansing gel and a micellar foam with a brush applicator. We are also expanding our Monoi range with two products much popular among our most loyal customers: a pure oil and an after-sun balm. In addition, we have been working hard on a format that we did not previously offer: our skincare sets will be available in April 2024 from our supermarket partners. We have designed some superb displays to show them off. We have also developed “ready-to-sell” displays for our 30-ml hand creams in pharmacies. Ultimately, we cannot wait to tell you about the launch of a new range in a completely new segment. It is planned for 2025. Premium Beauty News - What are your next goals in terms of growth? Gabriel Aiach - In 2023, Evoluderm generated 37% of its turnover in France, in supermarkets and pharmacies, with the latter accounting for 10% of the overall turnover. In addition, 15% of our sales in France are achieved online, on our website launched in 2019 and on several marketplaces. We want to strengthen our presence on the global level. We are distributed in over 30,000 points of sale worldwide. Our number one export market, the United States, is our priority, along with Europe. We have been negotiating to integrate two major retail chains in the UK, and we aim to cross the borders with our German and Italian neighbours. That is a real challenge for us. We would also like to set out again to conquer Asia, where we were starting to be well-established, particularly in China and South Korea, before the pandemic. To achieve this, we need to continue to expand our teams, particularly our sales force, as well as our industrial equipment. Within the next two years, we want our turnover to exceed 50 million and, within five years, we aim to double that figure."
"“Safe, Sustainable, Sensational,” Essentia Beauty’s innovation credo","As pioneers in full-service beauty solutions 25 years ago, what are our main strengths today? Katia de Martino - From our earliest beginnings, Essentia Beauty has remained true to its mission: to develop distinct concepts aligned with the DNA of our clients’ brands while meeting the real expectations of consumers. For Essentia, this means investing upstream in R&D to anticipate innovations that can meet market expectations for each brand. While packaging producers and formula manufacturers have more recently started offering full service,  Essentia on the other hand was born as an authentic full-service provider. This means that we have adapted to handle all stages of development and guarantee quality and consistency at every step. One of our pillars is to involve the quality team at the beginning of development to ensure 360° compliance, anticipate potential quality risks, and maintain control of lead times. Last but not least, our selected and qualified manufacturing network capabilities deliver responsive and flexible solutions, seamlessly scaling from low MOQs of 5K to high unit production runs of 500K+, according to customer demand. Additionally, we co-invest with some of our manufacturing partners on processes, certifications, and product innovations based on our analysis of market needs. With our recent exclusive partnership with MAD, an Italian specialist in fashion accessory decoration, we leverage their exceptional know-how to propose special effects on cosmetic packaging, allowing us to offer amazing three-dimensional materials and textures that we’ve given an original name to: Metamorphosis, signifying a groundbreaking potential for transforming standard packaging. What is your response to increasing demands for sustainability? Katia de Martino - To optimize the environmental impact of a product, Essentia advocates for a global approach. Providing solutions with genuine ecological value requires consideration of both how the consumer uses a product and its life cycle. Take makeup palettes as an example; they are increasingly popular but generate significant waste because once the consumer has used its favorite colors, these palettes quickly become unusable. That’s why we came up with the idea of our patent slide palette features, which have two refillable pans, each containing 3 to 5 eyeshadow colors. Consumers can easily refill the colors they use most and change out the products in line with trends. What’s essential is to bring added value to consumers who are concerned by ecology but are not willing to sacrifice functionality and aesthetic appeal. Our positioning and extensive experience in full service allow us to deliver solutions considering the finished product and its manufacturing process, formula, packaging, and filling. The objective is to provide efficient solutions that meet consumer expectations while lowering the environmental impact of both content and containers. Essentia has been an early promoter of refill systems. How do you continue to step up in this regard? Katia de Martino - We still believe that refill systems are the best solution considering the low percentage of the current effective recycled parts of packaging. The success of refill depends on different equations for each product category and can be complex for brands to manage. Refill should be an easy best choice for makeup products, which unfortunately have one of the lowest recycling rates. Now that many kinds of packaging formats exist, the challenge is to encourage consumers to buy refills. This ethical positioning can help encourage brand loyalty in the long run. To achieve this, we work on both functional solutions that are easily implemented as refills and on eco-desirability that transforms packaging into an object of desire, encouraging consumers to keep and refill it and thus giving it a second life. Our patented Slide palette, for example, has a removable lid that customers can choose when they purchase and renew as they wish, just like a cellphone case. The aim is to preserve the aesthetic appeal without having to change the whole palette, as well as to introduce personalization options, which has steadily become an important consumer expectation, especially in the luxury sector. How do you foresee the future of beauty? Katia de Martino - I believe that we have a duty to help evolve the mindset at all levels; a lot of players are willing and ready to change, but it is very complex because the market is fueled by a continuous flow of new products. We must preserve market dynamics but by responding more to consumer expectations. For this we should invert the development process, starting from their needs as the main driver of innovation. This is what we did for OZMEE, the brand incubated by Essentia, which addressed the need of consumers to identify the right mascara for their eye morphology based on real time, breakthrough digital technology. Indeed, personalization should be one of the main driver for conscious beauty as it has an undeniable positive impact on sustainability by reducing waste related to bad purchases."

"Ulike, the world leader of hair removal at home, expands in Europe","Founded 10 years ago, Chinese group Ulike soon conquered the Asian market by offering a unique home hair removal solution using Intense Pulsed Light (IPL). This top-of-the-range electrical device is claimed to offer safe, high-performance, precise application. “Every year, we developed a new, more powerful, better-designed generation, as Apple did with the iPhone, for example. And it is now the 6th generation. This helped us get 70% market shares in China and 50% in South Korea. In North America, where we have been present for two years, the brand quickly got ranked number one”, says Wanfen Xia, Director Europe and Middle East. Ulike’s success is based on a patented skin cooling technology called Sapphire Ice Cooling, which guarantees the safety and efficacy of hair removal. The synthetic sapphire and its system diffuse the pulsed light and disintegrate the hair bulb, while dissipating the heat with a cooling effect. “The aim is to bring professional quality to your home”, notes the Director. “We are the only brand to integrate this salon technology into a small machine. Thanks to our sapphire part, which has very low thermal conductivity, the temperature on the skin surface is maintained at 20°C, whereas it can go up to 70°C with other devices”, she adds. In recent years, Ulike achieved a strong turnover growth, reaching EUR 1.3 billion in 2023. There are now three brands: Ulike accounts for half of the sales volume, Gemo has adopted a high-end, anti-ageing positioning based on the radiofrequency technology, with products between EUR 1,200 and EUR 1,600, and Jmoon offers more affordable hair removal and anti-ageing devices for a younger public. Since 2023, it has been present on the European market with the Ulike long-lasting hair removal device, priced between EUR 300 and EUR 400. The group counts 1,800 employees worldwide, with four factories and two R&D centers, a team of 44 researchers and more than 300 innovation patents. 30% of annual profits are invested in R&D. “The aim is to cover Europe as a whole, focusing on three key countries, i.e. France, the UK, and Germany, to reach the third rank by the end of 2024, with a sales target of EUR 50 million. We have set up a multi-channel distribution strategy, because as a beauty tech expert, it is important to get to department stores and beauty chain stores to strengthen our positioning"", says Wanfen Xia. For the time being, the Ulike Air 2 and Air 3 IPL hair removal devices are available from the brand’s official website and from Amazon. The group aims to be soon available in large specialist stores, such as Darty, Fnac and Boulanger in France, as well as on platforms like VeePee and Showroom Privé. The partnership signed with DFS Travel Retail, owned by LVMH, led to a presence in the Hong Kong Beauty Collection area last December, and Macao will soon follow, while a pop-up at La Samaritaine is being discussed in the near future. “Our job consists in differentiating channels with different products and offerings”, specifies the Director. To establish its own credibility, Ulike will invest two million euros in a communication campaign in France, including TV advertising, PR, and the digital channel, and 10 million in Germany and the UK."
An experiential café for the launch of Nina Ricci’s new fragrance,"Launched at the end of February 2024, Nina Illusion eau de parfum follows on from the original Nina fragrance created by Olivier Cresp in 2006. For this new take, the dsm-firmenich  Master Perfumer, in collaboration with Nicolas Bonneville, created a floral, fruity and chypre juice. This sparkling version combines yuzu, orange blossom, pink pepper, raspberry, vanilla, and patchouli. This vegan fragrance contains 90% natural ingredients and includes upcycled lemon. Since its creation, the Nina fragrance has been revisited several times through multiple interpretations: Le Paradis in 2010, La Tentation in 2014, Les Délices in 2015, Les Gourmandises in 2017... In 2019, it was associated with the launch of Bella and Luna, in a conniving trio. In 2024, Nina Illusion wants to explore another facet of its universe and encourage people to live life to the fullest. The opening of the Nina Illusion Café in the heart of Paris is part of this seductive strategy. The Nina Illusion apple-shaped bottle features shades of iridescent pink, a special grade of glass developed by Verescence. It boasts 20% recycled glass and the case is made from FSC-certified paper. Designed in 2006, the Nina bottle was inspired by Nina Ricci’s legacy, and more specifically by the perfume Fille d’Ève dating from 1952, which refers to the forbidden fruit of a lost paradise. Nina adopted this symbolic shape for the bottle. For Nina Illusion, the metal jewel tied around the cap was created in collaboration with jewellery artist Hugo Kreit. This accessory can be worn as a ring or bracelet. An eye-catching piece that appeals to Gen Z. ""I like the fact that the apple is present in so many different ways. We have created a gem in the image of a universal flower that graces the bottle. It is very fluid, very contemporary,"" explains Harris Reed, Nina Ricci’s new Artistic Director. A 300 m2 pop-up café decorated in the colours of the bottle opened its doors from 7 to 10 March under the Canopée des Halles, a major passageway and shopping area in Paris. This immersive, highly Instagrammable space offered a range of experiences. In partnership with EL&N the London patisserie shop, the pop-up café proposed - among other delights - signature drinks and an exclusive sweet in the shape of an apple. A ""locker game"" allowed visitors to win perfume or fashion gifts (berets, T-shirts, tote bags...) after subscribing to a newsletter. An olfactory discovery display was set up at the entrance, opposite a giant Nina Illusion bottle. There was also an engraving workshop where visitors could personalise the perfume bottle available in the Séphora partner shop opposite. Finally, an ""Infinity Room"" allowed visitors to immortalise their journey through an endless game of mirrors, and to post their impressions on social networks using the hashtag #NINAILLUSION. Around the apple-shaped bottle, a core element of every advertising campaign since 2006, Nina Ricci has built a fairytale-like storytelling underpinned by the duality of innocence/transgression, and candour/temptation. These codes are aimed at young girls ready to make their mark and are personified by ingenuously seductive muses. The price positioning of Nina Illusion eau de parfum is in line with the purchasing power of this target, with an entry price of 70 euros for 30 ml. Similarly, the prices of the treats in the pop-up café have been deliberately kept down. The new campaign, shot at the Château de Vaux-le-Vicomte, France, features actress Kiernan Shipka as she goes after the coveted bottle as if in a dream. She is wearing a dress designed by Harris Reed and the bottle’s flower jewel. The atmosphere is poetic but moves away from fairytales. A subtle evolution. The Maison Nina Ricci (fashion and fragrance), owned by Puig, the Spanish Group, has refocused on two fragrance franchises: L’Air du Temps and Nina. The  Nina line currently includes Nina Illusion, Nina Le parfum, Nina L’eau de toilette and the versions Nina Rouge and Nina Extra Rouge. L’Air du Temps, launched in 1948 just after the war, has retained the shape of Lalique’s original bottle, which features two intertwined doves, symbols of love and peace. The fragrance still has a loyal customer base in the older age bracket. Every year, Nina Ricci releases a new edition in collaboration with an artist. This year, at the end of March/beginning of April, a bottle adorned with delicate golden flowers created by Anne Brun will mark the launch of the fragrance, revisited by Givaudan’s Perfumer Sonia Constant."
Granado opens its first store in New York and focuses on perfume,"In the global beauty and personal care market, companies are constantly challenged to innovate, adapt, and grow amidst fierce competition. Among these contenders is Granado, an iconic Brazilian brand that has not only stood the test of time but has also carved a niche for itself in an increasingly crowded market, appealing to consumers looking for products with a sense of history and authenticity. In 2023, the group achieved a record turnover of BRL 1.4 billion (approximately EUR 333 million euros or USD 360), an increase of almost 35% compared to 2022. Behind this success, a father-daughter duo: Christopher Freeman, CEO, and Sissi Freeman, marketing and sales director. The first bought the brand in 1994 from the last heir of the Granado family, the second joined the company in 2005. With the help of a French consultant, they renovated the identity of the sleeping beauty by building upon its heritage, developed new lines and opened their first own stores in Brazil. They implemented a similar strategy with Phebo, a historic perfume brand, originally from the north of the country, that was acquired in 1998. Today, Phebo accounts for 40% of net sales. The group’s retail footprint spans 93 stores in Brazil, including 4 Phebo outlets, and 7 international locations, the last of which was inaugurated in New York on February 2, in midtown Manhattan on Madison Avenue. However, if store openings enabled the brand to reconnect with its identity, to diversify its offering and move upmarket, the major part of its sales are made in drugstores and supermarkets in Brazil, where Granado is renowned for its soaps, toiletries and body care products. Entering into the perfume category was part of this diversification and upscaling strategy. In a very competitive Brazilian market, the brand opted for quality, choosing to macerate their fragrances, which was not a widespread practice in Brazil. The company has collaborated with foreign perfumers to create innovative fragrance, garnering attention from both existing and new consumers in Brazil and abroad. A profitable strategy since perfumes already represent 24% of sales in the brand’s own stores. Perfumes also lead sales in stores outside Brazil. “This led us to rethink our concept of international stores, to give more space to this category,” Sissi Freeman told Premium Beauty News. At the end of 2023, Granado reopened its first Parisian boutique, in the Marais district, after renovation work intended to enhance its lines of perfume and scented candles in a vintage universe mixing Art-Deco and a tropical atmosphere. ""While international sales are still a fraction of our global turnover, we see a huge potential for the brand. International expansion helped us to wider our mind with collaborations that were also instrumental in Brazil,"" highlighted the Marketing and Sales Director. “For instance, thanks to our collaboration with French perfumer Cécile Zaorkian, we were able to develop a fragrance with coconut notes that appealed to both Brazilian and international consumers,” she continued. In an ever-changing market landscape and international expectations that differ from those of its domestic market, Granado chose to innovate and introduce new products continuously while staying true to its roots. So far, it proved to be a recipe for success!"
"Infiniment Coty Paris, how Coty combines innovation and luxury perfumery","The Infiniment Coty Paris brand was born from the vision of two creators, Sue Nabi, CEO of the Coty Group, and Nicolas Vu, Founder of the ultra-luxury skincare brand Orveda. A duo with a passion for the world of beauty. African-born Sue, is a keen scientist, who aspires to create a ""desirable future"". Nicolas, Asian-born and steeped in urban culture, places the socio-cultural dimension at the heart of his creative thinking. Rather than a heritage range of re-editions, Sue Nabi and Nicolas Vu wanted to launch a brand in its own right. A collection inspired by the pioneering spirit of François Coty to lay the foundations for the ""perfumery of a new era"". So it’s no coincidence that this collection is being launched on the 120th anniversary of Coty, whose legendary creations have shaped modern perfumery, sublimating natural ingredients with the help of synthetic molecules that were new at the time, in particular the famous Chypre (1917), which gave birth to the chypre olfactory family. The creator also elevated the container to the level of art, with bottles designed as beauty objects. It is from this visionary spirit that Infiniment Coty Paris now takes its name, ""with a new generation of fragrances whose longevity and sillage have been augmented by science."" This new brand is the result of a three-year collaboration exchange between Sue Nabi, Nicolas Vu and the perfumers at dsm-firmenich, Symrise and IFF. Guided by the expertise of Séverine Dallet, Senior Manager Fragrance Design at Coty, this work has resulted in a range of fourteen fragrances with evocative names: Entre Genres, Les Mots Doux, Soleil d’Ikosim, Matin de Jade, Après l’Amour... Ultra-concentrated [1], the fourteen fragrances feature a new process that enhances the olfactory effect of certain ingredients over time. This innovation is called Aura Moléculaire, a fragrance diffusion technology based on a sugar-derived molecule that acts on the volatility and natural evaporation of ingredients. According to Coty, the molecule interacts like a magnet with a significant proportion of olfactory ingredients to modify their evaporation profile. As a result, these ingredients remain perceptible for a much longer time, beyond their natural volatility. This innovation means, for example, that the presence of jasmine absolute in a fragrance can be stretched into base notes, as in Les Mots Doux, where the fresh, floral and petal-like facet of jasmine extends well beyond the heart notes. Coty also points out that Aura Moléculaire prolongs the radiance of top notes for up to 30 hours. This new technology challenges the traditional codes of formulation. To make the most of it, the perfumer no longer uses the head-heart-base structure, but instead focuses on specific facets of a formula. Like the floral notes at the heart, or the woody-amber notes at the base. Aura Moléculaire encourages perfumers to work with ingredients differently, to achieve a new balance. Since 2018, Coty has filed several patents for Aura Moléculaire. A patent has also been filed for the use of this technology for Infiniment Coty Paris. The collection is divided into three phases, from the freshest to the most intense fragrances: Aube, Jour and Crépuscule. It’s a way of covering a broad olfactory spectrum and, of course, embracing the olfactory habits of Gen Z, who appreciate having a specific fragrance for different times of the day. For this collection designed by Symrise, dsm-firmenich and IFF, Coty has benefited from the technological innovations and eco-responsible materials of each of the fragrance houses. The fourteen fragrances in the collection explore or revisit perfumery standards. Like the bouquet of white flowers in Mots Doux, where the freshness of jasmine lingers on for hours. Or the solar orange blossom of Soleil d’Ikosim, where an SFE absolute, refreshed with neroli, settles on a woody base with gourmand and almond accents. Aristochypre returns to the chypre register, where delicate patchouli blends with rose and geranium. L’Amour Pourpre revisits the fougère accord in a sensual style, with lavender Diva hemmed in with balms, vanilla and incense. Finally, Après l’Amour plays an intimate card with a warm, amber tobacco note, conjuring up the image of a shared cigarette. For this collection, Coty has given priority to minimalist formulas, with no added colouring agents or UV filters. Furthermore, the Infiniment Coty Paris collection is made entirely from 100% carbon-captured and recycled alcohol, using a tried and tested process developed by LanzaTech. As part of an eco-responsible approach, Coty has chosen to fit this collection with bottles that should not be thrown away. Endlessly refillable, the bottle is designed to be kept, never thrown away. A hymn to minimalism, conceived and designed by Nicolas. Extremely complex to create, with a perfectly flat asymmetrical face on one side and bold facets on the other, it captures the spirit of the entire collection. At the end of their life, the bottles can be stacked and assembled to create works of art, in line with an Artcycling concept for which a patent application has also been filed. The range was presented to the public at an international launch in Paris on 2 March. Each fragrance is available for 230 euros for a 75 ml bottle and 330 euros for 150 ml refills."
"With the global birth rate falling, Mustela continues to reposition itself","""With 94% of parents surveyed saying they are familiar with the brand and 50% saying they use it, [2] Mustela is seen by consumers as an expert brand in the hygiene and care of babies and children,"" explains Clémence Ménez, Mustela Marketing Director, France. ""The brand’s two flagship products, the Gentle Cleansing Gel for Babies and Children and the Cleansing Water, recorded strong growth in 2023, with an increase in value of +11% for the first and +13% for the second, in a shrinking French market,"" she continues. Today, the brand wants to capitalise on its expertise in infant skin care to build a family-friendly cosmetics range. ""That’s what we’ve achieved with our suncare range designed for the whole family, from babies to parents, grandparents as well as children. Consumers trust Mustela, as the figures show."" Indeed, despite stiffer competition in the suncare market, Mustela recorded growth of +33% (editor’s note: compared with +23% for the global market). ""The excellent ratings of our suncare products on apps such as Yuka and INCI Beauty, as well as in the specialist consumer press (UFC-Que Choisir and 60 Millions de Consommateurs) have reinforced this confidence, as well as brand loyalty and preference. In addition, we have taken strong initiatives, such as the decision to definitively stop producing wipes in 2027, which illustrate our desire to be ever more transparent and respectful of the environment. In the meantime, we are launching a range of certified compostable wipes scheduled for the first quarter of 2024, to offer a cleaner than ever before solution,"" states Clémence Ménez. At the heart of the brand’s repositioning strategy, the suncare offer will be supported by a rather unexpected launch for the second quarter of 2024: a sunglass collection for young and old (editor’s note: four sizes, in three colours, will be offered from babies to adults). ""Launched last year by our Spanish subsidiary, this range, designed and produced by the Parafina company and branded Mustela, has been very well received by Spanish consumers. These eco-friendly glasses are made from recycled rubber from tyres, giving them excellent flexibility and resistance, which can prove very practical with small children. We plan to roll them out to 1,500 pharmacies in France by 2024. We’re convinced that this type of offering, which is seldom seen in pharmacies today, has a real place, as long as it’s backed up by sound advice from the pharmacist,"" explains Clémence Ménez. The mosquito repellent range launched two years ago was a runaway success in its first year, selling out after just three weeks on the market. ""This clearly shows that parents are interested in anti-mosquito products that are suitable for the whole family, including infants. I think they’ve found the reassuring response they needed in Mustela,"" pointed out Clémence Ménez. The Stelatopia range for atopic skin is also a fine example of the development of a family range; atopy being generally hereditary. This range grew by 14% last year, compared with 12% for the French market. ""Finally, we are committed to continuing to support and develop our zero waste offer with our reusable eco wipes, our universal balm, our eco-refill washing gel and our solid shampoo, to name but a few. These products aim to build the future of the brand and gently guide consumers towards changes in habits that are sometimes very entrenched."" Mustela’s products are now available in more than 10,000 French pharmacies and it partners with a large number of maternity clinics and independent midwives. The CSR innovations aimed at these partners, mainly pharmacies, focus above all on the deployment of furniture to display the brand’s bulk and zero waste offering. The bulk offer is split into two experiments. The first is the ""Pharma-Recharge"" consortium, which brings together five French dermo-cosmetics laboratories and which currently has five display units in France. Secondly, the Mustela bulk unit, currently present in 16 sales outlets. The latter aims to ensure the animation and follow-up of the points of sale already equipped and the training of teams. An Engagement unit was created in 2023 to promote the zero waste range. It can now be found in sixty pharmacies. ""Through it, sales outlets show their awareness and commitment to more sustainable and respectful products,"" emphasises Clémence Ménez. Mustela’s social commitment was beefed up in 2023 through its collaboration with Enfance et Partage, an association for the protection and defence of children victims of violence. This year, the brand is supporting an awareness-raising campaign on the shaken baby syndrome. In addition to France, its largest market, Mustela is of course also replicating the transformation of its product range throughout the world. The brand now generates 75% of its sales outside France, with a presence in around a hundred countries via its fifteen subsidiaries or distributors. The family offer is being rolled out more widely in promising markets such as Turkey, South America, and Asia."
FRP takes swift action to restructure The Body Shop in the UK,"Nearly 500 people working in stores of the British cosmetics chain The Body Shop will be made redundant in the United Kingdom, announced the administrators of the failed company. Some 75 stores will close within 6 weeks in the country, in addition to 7 closures already announced last week. FRP Advisory, responsible for the restructuring, had already announced the elimination of 270 positions at the London headquarters, tallying the total expected redundancies in the UK between 750 and 800. The company employed around 7,000 people worldwide before filing for bankruptcy, including 2,200 in the United Kingdom. ""After years of unprofitability and following a full evaluation of The Body Shop’s UK business, ... administrators have concluded that the current store portfolio mix is no longer viable,"" said FRP in a statement last week. It added that ""a reduced store footprint, will coincide with a renewed focus on the brand’s products, online sales channels and wholesale strategies,... supporting a return to financial stability.” In total, 116 stores will remain open out of the 198 that the chain had before filing for bankruptcy in the United Kingdom [1]. “In taking swift action to right-size The Body Shop UK store portfolio, we have stabilised the business and are providing the best opportunity for this iconic brand to have a long-term, sustainable future. The UK business continues to trade in administration, and we remain fully focused on exploring all options to take the business forward,” stated Tony Wright of FRP Advisory. These job cuts and the restructuring plan led by FRP only concern the United Kingdom and not the rest of the brand’s global network. But since its takeover by Aurelius, several loss-making subsidiaries in Europe and Asia have been sold, many of which have also been declared bankrupt. The Body Shop was founded in 1976 in Brighton (south of England) by British entrepreneur Anita Roddick. L’Oréal bought the brand in 2006 for around 940 million euros, when it was at the height of its fame, before selling it in 2017 to the Brazilian group Natura. Highly in debt after having also acquired Avon in 2019 and hit hard by the rise in interest rates, Natura sold The Body Shop at the end of 2023 for a fifth of the price paid to L’Oréal."
ISDIN banks on daily sun protection to accelerate its growth,"Born in Barcelona under the warm Mediterranean sun, ISDIN aims to establish itself as a force to be reckoned with in the field of sun protection and skin health. Founded in 1975 as a joint venture between the pharmaceutical laboratory Esteve and the Spanish cosmetics giant Puig, the brand now has 15 subsidiaries around the world, a footprint in 59 countries and is enjoying exponential growth. ""Our goal is to continue growing at a double-digit pace in 2024,"" explains Stéphanie Barbier, Global Corporate Marketing Director. ISDIN is making its mark in South America, where it is the market leader in Argentina and Peru. It has also won over Brazil, where it markets the country’s best-selling suncare product. Established a few years ago in the United States (online and at dermatologists) and in China (Tmall and specialised chains), the brand is beginning to make inroads in these difficult markets, which are keen to see new products. In Europe, ISDIN is the leader in suncare in Spain and is rapidly gaining recognition outside its domestic market, in particular by partnering with major sporting events, in keeping with its outdoor culture. France, Italy, and Germany are top priorities. The brand intends to build on the benefits of daily UV protection and capitalise on the sensoriality of its textures. ""The links between skin ageing and sun exposure are well established, but there is still a lot of work to be done to raise awareness of the importance of a regular photoprotection routine. Our sunscreen products were completely reformulated in 2023, and we have done a lot of work to create unique, light, non-sticky textures that are outstandingly sensorial,"" stresses Éric Jourdan, Global Corporate Innovation & Development Director. Some new products should help to sustain growth in 2024. After revamping its best-seller FusionWater Magic, with a new combination of sunscreens enriched with an antioxidant micro-algae extract from the Mediterranean, ISDIN will be unveiling FusionWater Magic Glow, an SPF 30 UV filter offering optimum daily protection with an instant radiant glow thanks to a formula enriched with micas. This year, ISDIN is also introducing its very first suncare stick, the result of a complex development, because the brand wanted to combine a high level of protection with its signature sensorial appeal. Finally, the Spanish brand is also expanding its expert Fotoultra line, dedicated to people whose exposure to the sun requires a specific response, with two new products: Fotoultra Redness, for skin with rosacea redness, and Fotoultra Stop Prevent Color, a tinted version of its protector dedicated to preventing pigmentation spots. At the same time, ISDIN is carrying out some awareness-raising campaigns on the importance of photoprotection - in schools in Spain and South America, and on tennis courts with athletes and spectators at major world tournaments - to help eradicate skin cancer. ISDIN, the only Spanish laboratory with B Corp certification, is also involved in many environmental protection initiatives, including a programme to clean up the Mediterranean Sea, in partnership with NGOs. ""Our commitment is to remove as much plastic from the sea as we put on the market with our FusionWater range,"" adds Stéphanie Barbier. As a result, 75 tonnes were removed from the oceans in 2023 and, given the success of the range, 200 tonnes should be extracted by 2024. These actions go hand in hand with major R&D initiatives: firstly, to reduce the use of plastic in packaging, by offering refill solutions (for anti-ageing ranges) and as much recyclable packaging as possible; and secondly, to limit the impact of formulas on the environment, by including an eco-toxicological analysis right from the development phase. ""We want to be a love brand, respected for our products and our actions,"" concludes the Marketing Director."
What is the outlook for The Body Shop after its sudden collapse?,"Last week’s announcement that the UK arm of The Body Shop was going bankrupt came as a shock in the country, where the brand was founded almost 50 years ago. Since then, the bad news has continued. Some of The Body Shop’s mainland European businesses have begun shutting down. The German stores has entered into administration and the Belgian, Luxembourg, Austrian and Irish subsidiaries might be next. If things are accelerating today, the difficulties are not new for the British channel. Founded in 1976 in Brighton, in the south of England, by entrepreneur Anita Roddick, the brand was a pioneer of environmentally friendly cosmetics, not tested on animals and a supporter of fair trade. But since then, the EU and many other countries have banned the testing of cosmetics on animals, natural or organic cosmetics brands have developed and innovative models focusing on solid products and packaging reduction have emerged. ""In the 1980s, The Body Shop was the place to go for young shoppers to splash out on fresh scented bubbles and beauty ranges, with a deep environmental conscience and a focus on social justice and conserving nature,"" Susannah Streeter, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown told AFP. In the meantime, competitors like Lush, L’Occitane, Neal’s Yard, Aesop and a multitude of indie brands have shaken up its model and gained market share. Purchased by L’Oréal in 2006, when it was at a staple of beauty routines in many countries, the brand was acquired in 2017 by Brazil’s Natura. However, the South American beauty giant then went on to buy Avon in 2019, a badly timed deal that left it with a hefty debt pile as the Covid pandemic hit and then interest rates began to rise around the world. When Natura decided to refocus on its Latin American business, buyers did not rush, despite a sale price significantly lower than what had been paid to L’Oréal. Indeed, at the time of the acquisition by Aurelius, The Body Shop had 2,500 stores in more than 70 countries, but many of these markets were unprofitable. According to people close to the matter interviewed by the Financial Times, despite significant losses in 2022, operations in the United Kingdom were deemed as the most attractive. Aurelius was also confident about businesses in Canada and Australia. However, damp revenues during the crucial festive period would have overturned the financial prospects, leading the UK business to the slide into administration! The investment firm would therefore have made a serious assessment error when acquiring The Body Shop. And Peter Wood, who was UK managing director of the firm, and the dealmaker behind Aurelius’s acquisition of the brand has exited the business, The Telegraph reported. According to The Times, the German firm has solidified its position as the brand’s top creditor before filing for bankruptcy. Shortly after buying the business, Aurelius made loans to the group that were secured against intellectual property assets and shares in its (profitable) Canadian arm. ""Just before Christmas, Aurelius released a statement saying they would ‘re-energise the business’ and ‘deliver the next chapter of success’. Less than three months later they are putting the brand into liquidation and look like they are first in line to be paid. Did they ever intend to grow the business?,” questioned Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh. At the end of January, Aurelius announced the sale of part of The Body Shop’s Europe and Asia business to what they described as a “family office”, a term that usually refers to the management of personal wealth. The buyer appeared to be Alma24, a company that was incorporated on 25 January 2024 in London. According to information from The Guardian, Alma24 is controlled by Friedrich Trautwein, an executive who has close links to Aurelius. The exact scope of the acquisition has been the subject of conflicting information; subsidiaries in continental Europe and Ireland would be affected, as well as Japan. The latest news is that France was not included in the operation, for legal reasons. It is also unclear with the subsidiary in the Netherlands is included in the deal. Within subsidiaries in mainland Europe, the lack of transparency on strategy is rising concerns. ""Aurelius’ approach to its investments, demonstrated by the recent swift liquidation of LloydsPharmacy in January 2024 - that was once the second biggest pharmacy chain in the UK - just two years after its acquisition, raises concern about a pattern of behaviour that suggests a preference for short-term profit strategies over the sustained stability of acquired enterprises,"" alerted a source pointing tactics that would aim to shift the cost of restructuring to public finances. In any case, the future of the retailer will be decided in the United Kingdom, where the company is headquartered, where are its roots and from where a large part of the products marketed by the subsidiaries around the world are delivered. The administrators from accounting firm FRP Advisory said they would “consider all options to find a way forward for the business and will update creditors and employees in due course.” The mission of administrators is to assess the financial situation and offers from potential buyers in order to find the best options to save jobs, but they will particularly focus on ensuring as much money is recouped as possible to return to creditors. And it is not excluded that Aurelius buys back The Body Shop after having slimmed it down. According to sources familiar with the situation, the brand is expected to survive in some form, but with far fewer shops. Several branches are also expected to be closed, in particular in Europe."
Schwan Cosmetics combines makeup and skincare with new Glowy Blur Stick,"Launched at the MakeUp in LosAngeles trade show, which was held at the Los Angeles Convention Center on February, 14 & 15, the Glowy Blur Stick combines the benefits of a color cosmetic with advanced active skincare formulations, including ingredients such as jojoba and cocoa butter, and other moisturizing and skin-protecting components, such as hydrasalinol, ginger, sea asparagus, meadowfoam seed oil. “The Glowy Blur stick is a great choice for makeup lovers who want a perfected look with minimal application hassle. You can use it flexibly as a concealer, highlighter, and for natural contouring. It’s quick to blend in and does not feel heavy on the skin. The intensity is buildable – for no-makeup makeup days, you can add just a touch on the high points of your face for a little bit of luminosity, while for more of a statement look, you can dial up the glow much more,” says Corinna Zeidler, Director, Brand Management at Schwan Cosmetics. The vegan Glow Blur Stick can be applied directly on the skin without any makeup tools. The product can be buffed out with a finger for a sheer to medium coverage result. The product can be manufactured in Schwan Cosmetics’ US-based factory, and packaging formats for the North American market will be available. The Glowy Blur Stick is one of several innovations in the company’s Color & Care strategy. Schwan Cosmetics says it will continue to include more advanced skincare ingredients as interest in multi-purpose products from both brands and consumers continues to rise. “The demand for care ingredients in makeup has skyrocketed,” says Stefanie Strittmatter, Director Global Category Management Lip at Schwan Cosmetics. “With our Color & Care strategy, we want to demonstrate that with a robust scientific approach and advanced care ingredients, color cosmetics can achieve noticeable skincare results with the same level of efficacy as skin care products themselves,” concludes Strittmatter."
How Scent of Africa is building a reputation in the global perfumery market,"""Through Scent of Africa, I wanted to pay tribute to Africa and its people,"" explains Tanal Ghandour, the brand’s founder. Having lived in West Africa for 40 years, his dream was to celebrate the continent’s generosity, to convey the strong sense of belonging, unique to the continent, and shared by its people. At a time when Africa is slowly opening up to niche perfumery - with the entry of brands such as Creed, Amouage and Mémo - the success of Scent of Africa testifies to its rise on the global perfumery scene. Africa has a thousand stories to tell, just like its olfactory terroirs, which Scent of Africa aims to highlight. Black pepper and vanilla from Madagascar, ginger from Nigeria, incense from Somalia, geranium and jasmine from Egypt... these raw materials are all well known to the perfume industry. While others are more rarely used, such as buchu leaves, from South Africa, whose minty, fruity, and sulphurous overtones could conjure up blackcurrant buds. A palette of iconic ingredients that form the backbone of the brand’s first collection, Eternal Legends. A range that aims to be accessible, in a market where the big brands are extremely popular. Ultimately, however, Scent of Africa wants to explore more complex olfactory territories. Spices, African cuisine... This potential offers creative possibilities, and the brand is expected to unveil a second, more sophisticated collection in 2025, with a strong focus on African ingredients. A ""niche"" range, in short, that could also appeal to the more mature Western markets. The brand has taken a cultural approach, by supporting events such as the Paris Fashion Week last September. Indeed, local craftsmanship and Afrofuturism - the wind of creativity blowing through the world of fashion - brought to life by daring designers, are winning over fashion houses. Like the Chanel fashion show held in Dakar in December 2022. This dynamism is very present in the region’s major cities - Lagos in Nigeria, Dakar in Senegal - and the brand aims to embody it through its trendy products. Because Scent of Africa aims to be a brand rooted in its time, nourished by the creativity of a young and dynamic population. ""Today, we’re witnessing an explosion of localities,"" points out Stéphanie Gazel, the brand’s Creative Director. ""Beauty is no longer just a Western phenomenon, it can also be Korean, Chinese, Arab or African."" The brand’s first collection leaves room for diversity, to adapt to moods and contexts. The brand therefore favours several olfactory universes, chiselled by the leading fragrance houses. Eternal Legends explores African mythology, paying tribute to local divinities in a gendered range that expresses assertive femininity and masculinity. Driven by heady fragrances - a key marker in African culture - the collection is built around duos for men and women, the first of which, Rakh and Nefee, was launched in March 2022. Women’s fragrances are dominated by floral and fruity accords. Like Laïka, the brand’s best-seller, a fruity floral accord by Nathalie Cetto (Givaudan), featuring orange blossom refreshed with pomegranate and buchu leaves, on a creamy gourmand base. Then there is Nefee (Delphine Lebeau, IFF), in which tuberose, with a twist of red fruits, blends with amber notes in a sensual setting. The opulent trail offers definite freshness, like the floral bouquet with marine notes in Bellua, a nod to island Africa (Nelly Hachem-Ruiz & Delphine Lebeau, IFF). For men, the spicy, peppery notes are quite prominent. In a play of Hot and Cold by Olivier Pescheux (Givaudan), Rakh combines the biting freshness of pepper and pink berries, spiked with cloves, on a dry woody background. Hagé (Jordi Fernandez, Givaudan), with its strong black pepper note, is set against an amber, woody and leathery base. Bellua’s masculine counterpart, Bezi, also features marine notes on a woody, mineral base (Olivier Pescheux & Jacques Huclier, Givaudan). At the end of April, Scent of Africa will launch a new duo, Fik, a tribute to the God of Heaven by Nelly Hachem-Ruiz (IFF) and Gleti, Goddess of the Moon (Julien Rasquinet). Today, the brand has developed mainly in Africa, where it reaches an audience of Millennials and trendsetters. The challenge for 2024 is the United States, a high-potential market for Scent of Africa. The brand will launch a second, more sophisticated range in 2025, the right timing to set foot in Europe."
BDK Parfums opens first store in Paris and consolidates brand identity,"312 Rue Saint-Honoré. David Benedek did not choose his store’s address by chance: “Back in 1959, my grandparents opened a perfume shop on the corner of Rue Saint-Honoré and Rue de la Paix. I am very proud and moved to be part of this family heritage”, he explains. The young entrepreneur is quick to point out his attachment to the world of perfume, which shaped his childhood, as well as to the central Palais Royal Parisian neighbourhood, where he set up his company’s offices in 2016. Not far from there, the Benlux Louvre perfume shop at 174 Rue de Rivoli is part of this history. It is the story of a family saga that began two generations ago, when a couple of Romanian and Hungarian origin, David’s grandparents, moved to France. The brand’s first flagship store is thus taking root in a territory that is both familiar and the epicentre of the international clientele targeted. When it comes to the interior design, David Benedek gave their chance to two young architects, Arthur Blanche and Daniele Profita, for whom it was the first retail space concept. The glass front extends over two levels, flooding the interior space and its mezzanine with light. A combination of mineral materials, Burgundy stone and travertine creates a monochrome effect. Longitudinal shelves run the length of one wall, embodying the “olfactory library” concept dear to the company. “We thought of it in terms of a living space, rather than a commercial area. The mezzanine is a place for conversation. And we have been thinking of organizing master classes that would bring together a perfumer and an artist”, reveals the managing director. Alexandra Carlin, who previously worked with the brand on Villa Néroli and Velvet Tonka – which won a Fragrance Foundation France Award in 2022 – supported David Benedek in creating the 312 Saint-Honoré perfume to celebrate the opening of the store. The result is a sensual, mineral, bright musk built on an original chord of woody and amber notes. “The brief focused on the materials that make up the decoration of the venue. I wanted to use a palette of materials ranging from transparent to off-white and recreate this subtle mineral harmony of white tones. I built up a vertical composition that echoes the high ceilings. The other guiding principle we set ourselves was that of the cocoon: the store actually helps withdraw from the hustle and bustle of the neighbourhood to better connect with the fragrance. For this reason, priority was given to musk, because it is a material that relates to intimacy and to the skin”, emphasizes the Symrise perfumer. Artistic director David Benedek describes the new fragrance as follows: “It is a comforting scent that anyone would like to smell on someone’s neck. It is a rather abstract fragrance that stands out by its great delicacy and goes against what is expected in niche perfumery, whose proposals are often extreme. We are taking a conscious risk, given the type of clientele"". Trained at the well-known French fashion school Institut de la Mode and by Cinquième Sens, David Benedek was just 26 when he set about creating his own company. Here is how he laid the foundations: timelessly chic fragrances that tell a Parisian story, and a focus on beautiful materials. The collections (Parisienne and Matières) are structured around these two creative lines. The Azur collection, with its emphasis on citrus notes, and the Exclusive collection are built on these two pillars. The company currently offers 20 fragrances, as well as a collection of candles known as “Les Nocturnes” and a refined detergent water. Today, the bestseller is Gris Charnel, in its eau de parfum and extract versions composed by Mathilde Bijaoui (Mane). Next come Rouge Smoking by Amélie Bourgeois (Flair), and Pas ce Soir by Violaine Collas (Mane). Based in Paris, the company has selected only French partners to promote the excellence of its different skills. The iconic bevelled bottle is made in Normandy by Verreries Brosse. It owes its unique transparency to the re-burnt glass technique. The caps are developed in the Paris region by a traditional goldsmith and jeweller. Their shape is inspired by one of the most emblematic monuments on the Parisian Right Bank: the dome of the Grand Palais. The paper label is produced by the Bordeaux-based printing house New Darmon Étiquettes, and then affixed by hand to each bottle. Just like a book binding, the box is crafted by MPO, a family business based in the western region of Le Mans. Finally, the ink is of natural origin and the paper, dyed in the mass, is recycled. BDK Parfums currently counts 500 points of sale, exports to 58 countries, and employs 16 people."

"""Skin is the mirror of our overall health,"" Barbara Paldus, Codex Labs","Premium Beauty News - After having spent more than twenty years in Silicon Valley, creating two technology companies and registering 40 patents, you decided to venture into cosmetics in 2019. How did an electrical and electronic engineering graduate from Stanford University come to this? Barbara Paldus - Because it was possible to innovate! It was my son, who was ten at the time, who sparked my interest in mainstream skincare products, as he was allergic to many of them. I looked into the matter and discovered that the problem was caused by a preservative: phenoxyethanol. As I continued my research, I discovered that the use of many preservatives could, more generally, upset the balance of the skin microbiome. This is how I came up with the idea of creating a cosmetic biotechnology brand dedicated to supporting the microbiome. I started looking for a skincare brand to take over and chose the Irish company Bia. That is how the Codex Labs adventure began in 2019. Premium Beauty News - What alternative to phenoxyethanol does Codex Labs use? Barbara Paldus - It is a patented food-grade preservative system called PreservX®, which is present in every Codex Labs skincare product. It protects water-based formulas by boosting the balance of the skin’s microbiome, but not only that. It also has a moisturising and protective function. It is derived from the fermentation of lactobacillus, coconut oil, propanediol and organic food acids. Premium Beauty News - How is Codex Labs positioned in the cosmetics landscape? Barbara Paldus - Transparency is at the heart of our commitments, both in terms of composition and results. Our products are designed with the support of a team of experts, including scientists, botanists, cosmetic chemists, and dermatologists. By combining their knowledge and insights, we provide consumers with effective skincare solutions that take into account the microbiome, which we believe is essential. All formulas are clinically tested by the Eurofins analysis laboratory in Lyon, France. Codex Labs is a dermo-cosmetics brand offering skincare products - most of which are Cosmos certified by Ecocert - that provide an effective response to skin issues such as acne, the signs of ageing (fine lines and wrinkles), skin sensitivity and dryness, and oxidative stress. From the second quarter of 2024, we will be introducing a range of skincare products and cleansers for eczema, psoriasis, and rosacea. At the end of 2023, we launched our first dietary supplements: one for hormonal acne and another to support the skin barrier. Others are planned for the second quarter of 2024. At Codex Labs, we are convinced that the skin is a mirror of our body’s condition, particularly our internal organs. That is why we want to take our expertise much further by offering DNA testing on our new www.sgbnet.com platform, which was recently launched in the United States. We are currently working on adapting it to France and other European countries, to launch it at the end of 2024. Premium Beauty News - Can you tell us more about this platform?  Barbara Paldus - At Codex Labs, we are convinced that many health issues can be solved by correlating solutions for the skin, the intestine, and the brain. In other words, we take a close interest in the diet, lifestyle, and mental health of each individual to provide them with personalised solutions to their skin problems. We offer two kits: DNA Decode My Skin, which focuses on the skin, and DNA Decode My Health, which looks at the absorption, transport, and metabolism of vitamins A to E and folic acid. Afterwards, the person who has taken the test can schedule a consultation with an expert who will help them analyse the results and provide advice on their lifestyle and diet. We provide recommendations on which professionals to consult to deal with a given problem, whether it be a dermatologist, a nutritionist, a naturopath, a psychologist... Premium Beauty News - The idea behind this testing platform is also to make a link with Codex Labs products? Barbara Paldus - Not explicitly, but necessarily yes. Let me explain. We are convinced that our products - food supplements and skincare products - are highly effective. In certain countries such as the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the United States and even England and Ireland, we are already present in a large number of pharmacies and health and beauty stores, and professionals - dermatologists, naturopaths... – who recommend our products. Premium Beauty News - And in France, where is the brand distributed? Barbara Paldus - At the moment, we have a 100% online presence in the French market on the Nocibé.fr, Blissim.fr, Slolie.fr and Ecco-verde.fr websites. In 2023, we ran a communication and awareness-raising campaign for healthcare professionals in France to help them discover our products, their composition, and their effectiveness. As a result, we have established several partnerships with dermatologists and naturopaths. Our presence in pharmacies and health and beauty stores in France is scheduled for 2024. Pharmacy outlets are our primary channel, in complete harmony with our values."
Fiabila appoints Filippo Manucci as new President and CEO,"Mr. Filippo Manucci has held key executive positions at multiple B2B and B2C global cosmetics companies. Before joining Fiabila, he served at Intercos, the world’s leading cosmetics ODM, as Global Senior Vice President for the Skin, Hair, Personal Care & Fragrances divisions.

Pierre Miasnik will remain involved in the company, both as a minority shareholder and a Board member."
Six key beauty players launch the Value of Beauty Alliance,"In a report entitled What is the Value of Beauty? How beauty & personal care shape our economy, society and wellbeing, the six founding members highlight that the European beauty market generates 74.1 billion euros per year and that 80 percent of consumers, within the European Union, consider beauty products as an essential part of their daily lives. The sector is also a cradle of scientific advancement, investing EUR 2.35 billion in R&D and nurturing over 30,040 scientists in diverse fields. The cosmetics industry also strives to improve its environment footprint, from green energy usage to eco-friendly packaging. In 2022 five out of the thirteen companies that globally achieved a ‘Triple A’ CDP Rating for their sustainability efforts were in the beauty and personal care sector. “The aim of the Alliance is to highlight the role and importance of the cosmetics industry, particularly among lawmakers. The six founding members represent the different facets of our sector,” L’Oréal Groupe CEO, Nicolas Hieronimus, told Premium Beauty News. “We want to put the value chain of the cosmetic industry and its main players under the spotlights. European lawmakers have little knowledge about the cosmetics industry, the weight of which is nevertheless very important in the trade balance of many countries, including Germany,” added Vincent Warnery, CEO of Beiersdorf. The coalition is open to all actors contributing to the cosmetics value chain in Europe, keen to help providing a better understanding of the economic and social contributions of the ecosystem. Albéa and Puig already have committed to join this collective effort."
UPSA enters the gummies market with British startup Rem3dy Health,"Already present on the food supplements market, in particular with vitamin C, UPSA aims to turn this dynamic, fast-changing segment into a sustainable growth driver. “The market of food supplements in the form of gummies has achieved a double-digit growth in France for over five years. In the pharmaceutical channel, the main distribution network for these products, growth reached +15% in 2022, compared with the previous year. Today, in the US, 50% of food supplements are delivered in the form of gummies”, explains Anthony Lallier, Managing Director of UPSA France and in charge of UPSA Global portfolio development. To gain a foothold in this market, the Southwestern French laboratory has acquired a stake in the British startup Rem3dy Health, which invented the first gummies using a patented 3D printing technology. The aim is to offer a holistic vision of wellness through an attractive range, without compromising on pharmaceutical quality or efficacy. “The 3D printing technology makes it possible to separate the actives without mixing or heating them. Their quality is therefore not altered over time. They are better preserved and the different layers contribute to the organoleptic pleasure. The result is a unique texture and taste, and gums that do not stick to your teeth. Plus, the formulas are vegan, sugar-free and gluten-free, and only based on natural colorants”, adds Anthony Lallier. The UPSA x Nourished 7-in-1 Gummies come in five formulas combining vitamins, minerals, and plants: sleep, energy, beauty, immunity, and slimming detox. They have been available exclusively in pharmacies in France and Italy since November 2023, but will be gradually rolled out in other countries, mainly in Europe (Belgium, Spain, Greece, Switzerland, etc.), in 2024. This launch, which is part of UPSA’s growth plan, is supported by a communication plan combining TV and digital channels, point-of-sale activations and sampling. Since September 2023, the UPSA x Nourished 7-in-1 Gummies have captured almost 10% of the pharmacy market and reached the second rank in France. The products are manufactured in the UK by Rem3dy Health Group, and then they are distributed to pharmacies by the UPSA teams based in the town of Agen. “In an ever-changing environment, a company like UPSA can only keep growing if it constantly reinvents itself. Our acquisition of a stake in Rem3dy Health is a sign of our agility and desire to continue adapting our offering to new consumer expectations in the food supplements market”, concludes Isabelle Van Rycke, President and CEO of UPSA."
"Seeking to capture a wider audience, luxury fashion brands enter beauty","In October 2023, global luxury titan Kering – the group behind Gucci, Saint Laurent, Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen, among others – closed its acquisition of luxury fragrance house Creed; a deal considered significant in both fashion and beauty because of its scale and the price-tag attached. And transactions like this follow on from other major acquisitions and mergers in the space, such as Spanish fashion major Puig’s majority stake acquisition in British beauty brand Charlotte Tilbury back in 2020 and The Estée Lauder Companies’ purchase of Tom Ford in April of this year. In September 2023, Richemont announced the creation of a perfume and beauty division. But why had fashion-beauty mergers ramped up? And could fashion truly succeed in expanding into such a dynamic and competitive global beauty market? Financial and market experts weighed in at Beauty Independent’s recent Dealmaker Summit EU/UK 2023 in London, UK last month. Sandra Nait-Amer, managing director at independent financial services group Rothschild & Co, said it had certainly been interesting to watch how business ideas had evolved in recent years. In luxury fashion, Nait-Amer told attendees there had been a “complete shift of strategy” recently, spurred by “the realisation that there is a big business to be made within beauty”. What beauty offered fashion, she said, was cashflow with better visibility, free from cycles typical in fashion, along with access to a dynamic and sizeable global market. Via beauty, high-end fashion brands could capture a wider audience in the “aspirational luxury consumer”, she said. “...When you look at brands like Chanel or Dior, 40% of the brand sales are from fragrance and beauty. When you’re the owner of Gucci, it makes a lot of sense to leverage the value of the brand you’ve created in this new vertical that is also growing in a more robust way,” she emphasized. Luxury fashion brands also took “a lot of time to build”, she said, so when considering growth, it made sense to create a beauty offering within the brand versus acquiring and scaling another fashion house. And this potential for luxury fashion brands to succeed in beauty had already been “well proven”, Nait-Amer said. Armani, for example, had a strong track record in makeup and Chanel was big across all beauty categories. “In the past, [fashion brands] would only see the beauty potential in launching their fragrance under the same name, but now you can really build a whole beauty business that’s worth billions, beyond just fragrance. The size of the prize is much bigger than people thought initially.” However, the finance expert said stretching into beauty only made sense for scaled and matured fashion brands – the “mega luxury brands” – because for younger, growing fashion businesses it made more sense to focus on the core business. Entering into beauty also required “a lot of investment” often only available after scaling, particularly for talent-building in-house, she said. On top of this, high levels of investment also made more sense for companies with multiple fashion brands in their portfolio versus mono-brand fashion firms, she said. Angela Chou, investor at UK-based venture capital firm Felix Capital, agreed, stating it was “a lot” for founders to take on a second sector in early stages. “Most of the more important conversations are about geographies, new product categories and going into wholesale,” Chou said. Obviously, there were exceptions, she said, with some fashion founders entering beauty early, but in these cases, they more likely moved into fragrance; crossing “that blurry line” between beauty and fashion. Nait-Amer added that, for the time being, fashion majors were not interested in acquiring parts of the beauty supply chain but instead focused on on-boarding and picking up brands. “I don’t think any of these fashion groups want to build a vertically-integrated supply chain in beauty. The attraction of the beauty sector is that the ecosystem is very strong, the outsourcing is very strong, so you don’t need to internalise these capabilities. Across the supply chain, you have lots of experts that do these products very well and it would be very difficult to replicate that level of innovation and agility because the pace is much faster in beauty than fashion.” Asked what beauty categories offered most promise for fashion majors, Nait-Amer said there were only a handful that made sense. Fragrance and colour cosmetics, for example, were two examples of “well trodden path[s]” that aligned well with the creative aspect of fashion, she said. Skin care on the other hand was far tougher to enter as a fashion brand because consumers shopping this space tended to look for science, efficacy and credibility versus brand power, she said. For fashion to succeed in skin care, she said acquisitions of verticals made more sense than building in-house capabilities. Nader Naeymi-Rad, founder and publisher of Beauty Independent, said one potential game-changing area where fashion could expand successfully into beauty was in wellness and athleisure. “Athleisure is to fashion what wellness is to beauty. I may not buy a skin care product from Chanel, but an SPF product from Patagonia or supplements from North Face makes sense. So, I think wellness and athleisure is one area you may be able to get that fusion, where they’re both off-centre: they’re not core typical beauty, nor core typical fashion and you may be able to create something exciting in both worlds and remain authentic,” Naeymi-Rad said."
Major beauty players create TRASCE to get a clearer view of their supply chains,"With the support of FEBEA, the French federation of beauty companies, the members of the new consortium [1] have committed to map their supply chains across the entire value chain on a common digital platform, Transparency-One. The latter was selected for its ability to guarantee each supplier the ownership, security and confidentiality of the data they share. Transparency-One has already been used in other sectors of activity, such as the food and automotive industries, for the deployment of large-scale traceability approaches. TRASCE will help respond to three main challenges for the industry by strengthening the understanding of the supply chains, assessing the related social and environmental risks and determining the necessary actions for common progress plans. ""The essential and demanding work of mapping our supply chains carried out in recent years has allowed us to understand the main limits of the exercise. It is sometimes quite difficult for a single client to convince distant tier suppliers to commit to this process, when we do not exchange directly with them or when they do not meet the same regulatory requirements. Based on this observation, we proposed that the actors of the sector join forces to trace our supply chains as far and as quickly as possible,"" explains Julien Garry, International Director of Purchasing and Packaging Innovation Development at Chanel Parfums Beauté. According to Meghan Ryan, Executive Director of Responsible Sourcing at The Estée Lauder Companies: ""Through shared digital tools and close collaboration, we have an opportunity to move the needle in transparency and elevate how we source responsibility, with attention to potential impacts on people and the environment."" “We are convinced of the need to align the industry on a single traceability tool, and to implement a common methodology,” shares Karl Hensen, Quality Director Surface Solutions at Merck. According to Gilles Swyngedauw, Vice President CSR and product sustainability at Albéa Cosmetics Fragrance: “Cosmetics packaging will have to revolutionize in the years to come. We’ve been working on these issues for years. As a global player in the sector, it soon became clear to us that we needed to create a common methodology to harmonize needs across the industry and achieve our goals by involving as many stakeholders as possible.” This collaborative approach is not a first within the cosmetics industry. In 2022, several international players have joined forces within the EcoBeautyScore consortium, in order to create an industry-wide environmental assessment and scoring system for cosmetic products."
"Rising rapidly, Cosnova aims to join the top 5 global makeup leaders","With 2023 net sales of EUR 817 million (USD 890 million) compared to 617 million euros last year, the Cosnova Group has far exceeded its own targets for the recently concluded financial year. Just one year after crossing the EUR 500 million turnover milestone, the family-owned group now believes the billion euro threshold is now well within reach, as well as entering the world’s top 5 in makeup. As the company enters its third decade, this 32% increase in sales, compared to 2022, marks the second consecutive year with a sales surge of over 30%. Cosnova said it has not only increased its market share across all global regions, spanning both brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce platforms, but has also broadened its retail presence and strengthened distribution channels in nearly 90 operating countries. According to the group, the success of the preceding twelve months can be directly attributed to the escalating regionalization of essence and Catrice product offerings, in particular for the USA and the Middle East. In Germany, Cosnova continues to attract consumers, with sales up 36%. The scenario of success is similar in the rest of Europe, with a growth rate of 38%. In the U.S., Cosnova was able to expand its market position, with an organic growth of 29%. Both offline and online retail were key growth drivers. Essence expanded its partnership with Ulta Beauty and successfully entered more than 300 Target stores. Amazon remained the most important e-commerce channel with Cosnova’s business growing by 6% in 2023. Results are also rising sharply in the rest of North America, with organic growth of 23%, and in the rest of the world, with sales growth of 24% compared to the previous year. This massive increase in sales is also a challenge for Cosnova, who had to cope with temporary supply chain bottlenecks in 2023. Throughout the year, the company effectively addressed these challenges through strategic initiatives including continuously investing in the capacities of its suppliers. In addition, Cosnova has outlined plans for a substantial expansion of its central warehouse in Germany in the forthcoming years. “We have reorganized our supply chain and our logistics, and we are preparing to resize our infrastructure to adapt to this growth. But 90% of our products are made in Europe, that eases our operations,” emphasizes Soazig Le Prince, General Manager of Cosnova France. Although the group does not publish quantified goals for 2024, it claims to be confident in its powerful business model, which made the demonstration of its strength. “We are the leader in makeup in Europe, and we are gaining market shares in all the countries where we are present,” adds Soazig Le Prince. Christina Oster-Daum, founder and CEO of Cosnova, the results for the 2023 financial year show the strong affinity of the group’s brands with consumers as well as the relevance of its innovations. ""Even though the global economic conditions are currently challenging, we are convinced that we will continue to grow in the future. This applies to both the national and international markets. The substantial investments we have made over the past four years and our sustainable orientation have given us a solid foundation for this. After this sensational financial year, we are extremely optimistic about the third decade of our company’s history,"" concludes Javier González, co-founder, and president of Cosnova."
Melvita: the green powerhouse of the L’Occitane group moves upmarket,"Nathaëlle Davoust, who has headed Melvita for just over two years, is leading the overhaul of the forty-year-old brand. “With this revamp, we aim to strengthen our legitimacy as an innovative, modern brand, although we are one of the leaders in the organic segment”, explains the General Manager. Melvita did not wait for the rebranding to recruit Miss France 2011 and TV presenter Laury Thilleman as its social media ambassador, in order to convey a sparkling, fresh image of its skincare products and to recruit a younger audience. “We have already felt Laury’s impact throughout France. We are already seeing a rejuvenation of our customer base"", smiles Nathaëlle Davoust. Melvita has announced a double-digit growth for 2023. Japan is its biggest market, closely followed by France. In Japan, the brand has succeeded in stabilizing its own stores, which now number twenty, despite the difficult situation related to the Covid-19 pandemic. In France, Melvita intends to focus its investments on pharmacies, with a short-term target of 3,000 points of sale, compared with just over 1,500 today. “Since the pandemic, pharmacies have come to occupy a prominent place and gained French people’s trust, in their minds and daily lives. As a result, we are going to step up our presence in this channel and strengthen our team training and point-of-sale events”, stresses Nathaëlle Davoust. “Behind Melvita’s rebranding, our strong message is meant to show – I would even say prove – that an organic brand can be elegant and glamorous. By 2025, 100% of our packs will have changed identity and will boast the brand’s new logo and colours. We have taken advantage of our work on brand image to streamline our range, reducing it all to 120 references, compared to 150 previously”, stresses the CEO. The new dark green logo still emphasizes naturalness, but in a more subtle, premium way. The round letters were designed to express the values of generosity, joy, gentleness, and femininity. Each flagship range will have its own distinctive packaging colour. Also, the new packs are meant to strike the right balance between the codes of expertise, with lots of white, and the drawings of plant shapes, for naturalness. Everywhere are plant veins that resemble skin cells. NectarCalm, Melvita’s new skincare range to be launched in February 2024, will be the first to adopt the brand’s new colours and logo. With a minimalist composition approved by a toxicologist, this line was designed to help sensitive skin regain its balance. It includes two products: a soothing, strengthening serum and an anti-redness, soothing balm. These compositions got a score of 100/100 on Yuka. A light version of the balm will be available in April 2024. “One of the biggest challenges for us as an organic brand is to minimize our carbon footprint”, continues Nathaëlle Davoust. With this in mind, starting from 2024, all cream jars will be refillable. As a reminder, the brand’s bottles are made from 83% recycled plastic. Melvita has committed to replacing all controversial ingredients in its formulas, if any, and even to discontinuing the products concerned, in certain cases. That is why the company has made the decision to stop producing its global anti-ageing range Nectar Suprême, based on royal jelly, for ethical and animal welfare reasons. “We are currently working on a new skincare line to replace it. It should be launched at the end of 2024”, she explains."
ACT Beauty boosts its CSR commitment with the acquisition of Bien Faire,"ACT Beauty is stepping up significantly its CSR strategy! The Lille-based company, which specialises in beauty and fashion accessories, small bags, and luxury packaging, has recently acquired Bien Faire, to strengthen its eco-responsible offering. Bien Faire is a spin-off from Fairly Made Impact, the start-up created by Laure Betsch and Camille Le Gal to enhance the sustainability of the fashion industry, notably by using SaaS software to trace the production chain and analyse product life cycles. ""Fairly Made Impact wanted to concentrate on its core business. For our part, we were interested in the supply chain set up by the company, with partners selected for their social and environmental commitments and robust traceability. For us, it was an effective way of accelerating our CSR commitments and strengthening our offering to our customers,"" explains Julien Briand, ACT Beauty’s Managing Director. Since 1 December 2023, the Bien Faire teams have been relocated to ACT Beauty’s Paris premises, enabling the company to offer eco-responsible or upcycled solutions, guaranteeing traceability from yarn to finished product. The approach is based on a rigorous selection of suppliers throughout the value chain, and on raw materials certified to internationally recognised standards such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) and the Global Recycled Standard (GRS). Already available for textiles, the offer will be rapidly extended to other types of products, improving the traceability and transparency of industrial processes. Bien Faire’s integration adds proven expertise in CSR and end-to-end traceability across the value chain. The company plans to build on this acquisition to offer its customers an additional level of eco-responsibility by working closely with its partner factories. ""Our ambition, for ‘Bien Faire by ACT Beauty’, is to become our label for a full offer, encompassing textiles, beauty accessories, brushes, and packaging, all of them certified and traceable,"" explains Julien Briand. The company has been awarded the Eco Vadis Platinum label since 2021 and is in the process of obtaining B Corp certification, thereby extending the eco-responsible approach it formalised more than five years ago. The ""Bien Faire by ACT Beauty"" certified eco-responsible offer reinforces ACT Beauty’s strategic positioning as a key player in the top-of-the-range accessories and gifts sector. With a team of 30 employees based in Lille, Paris, New York and Shenzhen, and sales divided equally between beauty accessories, packaging solutions and textiles, the company is continuing to expand on the European and North American markets."
Biopack Arcade Beauty invests to meet growing sample demand,"Located in Normandy, in the North-West of France, the Biopack factory, one of the five European manufacturing sites of the Arcade Beauty group, is facing a surge in demand for its core business: the filling and packaging of samples and mini perfume and cosmetic products. Over the past three years, the company has invested 3.5 million euros to increase its production capacity. After the installation of five new machines between late 2023 and early 2024, combined with the implementation of a vast operational efficiency program, Biopack should have around 25% additional capacity this year. Enough to take the heat off, after a year 2023 marked by production tensions. Between 2017 and 2023, Biopack’s turnover doubled to pass the 60 million euro mark. This growth was supported by a strong recruitment plan, with the workforce increasing from 100 staffs in 2017 to 200 staffs in 2023. Furthermore, 3.5 million euros have been invested in the expansion of the site, rationalization and new machines, over the last three years. “In 2023, additional volumes had to be produced even though all the machines had not yet arrived. We have therefore implemented a performance strategy to get the most out of our production tool. This lean production program allowed us to ramp up production in good conditions,” explains Mathieu Guilluy, the plant manager. According to Biopack Arcade Beauty, the rapid growth in demand is explained by the strengthening role of samples. “Of course the strong growth in the global perfume market has driven our volumes, but the trend is more general and is linked to less brand loyalty, leading consumers to test more products,” underlines Mathieu Guilluy. Consumers’ desire that samples provide an experience as close to that of full-size products leads to an increased sophistication that benefits mini products, the production of which has tripled since 2017, while that of mini sprays increased by 20% over the same period. For its part, the production of traditional sample cards has stalled. However, the success of mini products and the trend towards premiumization require production to be adapted to a wide variety of formats. “We need very flexible machines, which we can adapt very quickly to industrialize products,” says Mathieu Guilluy. The Biopack plant can respond to requests from large groups as well as small brands with minimum quantities varying from 5,000 to 10,000 units depending on the type of product. “But we remain flexible, our strength is in finding solutions,” insists the plant manager. Depending on the brands’ requests, Biopack can carry out packaging, its core business, but also, ensure the sourcing of formulas and packaging, in addition to managing decoration and assembly operations. Finally, let’s note that the investments in additional production capacity were concomitant to the implementation of a plan to reduce the environmental footprint that enabled Biopack to reduce electricity consumption while increasing production."
Galénic aims to strengthen its footprint on the luxury skincare market,"Organized at the end of December at the Hôtel de la Monnaie in Paris, the Galénic Dermatology Research Fund awards ceremony was an opportunity for the brand, which celebrated its 45th anniversary in 2023, to reaffirm its ambitions after having joined China’s Yatsen group in 2020. “Galénic was created by visionary pharmacist Pierre Fabre in 1978. From the outset, the brand’s mission has been to bring science into the world of luxury beauty. The launch of the Galénic Dermatology Research Fund is part of this heritage,” said Sarah Michel-Stevens, Managing Director of Galénic Cosmetics Laboratory. Precisely, the creation of an endowment fund and of a scientific committee [1] are intended to consolidate this identity strongly rooted in dermatological research. “Galénic is a genuine scientific brand built on rigorous research and scientific evidence. I’m extremely pleased to be part of this collaboration, which will play an important role in the development of improved knowledge of skin physiology. Their support of innovation and scientific discovery is in perfect harmony with the needs of biomedical research. For over a year now, we have been working together to push even further the boundaries of dermatology, research and scientific progress,” highlighted Professor Jean-David Bouaziz, President of the Galenic Dermatology Research Fund Scientific Committee. Coming from different areas of science, the seven members of the committee* have the mission of evaluating and choosing the most innovative research projects. During the ceremony on December 19, 2023, four projects were awarded: Dr Corinne Leprince for her researches on the importance of autophagy in the barrier function of the epidermis; Dr. Elodie Labit’s for the exploration of neuro-immune interactions in skin repair; Dr Muriel Cario Andre, for a research project focused on a new method for improving the bioavailability and penetration of active ingredients into the skin, specifically for the treatment of skin cancers; and Dr. Fabien Chevalier for a research project focused on the role of small molecule called miR-30a in skin aging regulation. A grant of 100,000 euros, divided into four financial allocations of an individual amount of 25,000 euros, will provide the winners with the financial means allowing them to push their research projects forward. Thus, Galénic aims to perpetuate its heritage as a pioneering brand of innovative skincare and collaborations with experts in dermatology seen as a complement to the scheduled launch of a dedicated R&D Center in Toulouse, France."
"Facial sheet masks, and patches: FSKorea’s offer strong asset","What are the benefits of a facial sheet mask? J.K. Hwang -  A facial sheet mask is a skin care treatment that provides the skin with all the elements and active ingredients it needs to maintain its balance. Before using a facial mask, it’s important to know your skin type to identify your needs and choose the one that’s best suited to you. This means that each skin type requires its own special care? J.K. Hwang - If your skin is prone to imperfections, it’s best to use a purifying mask that focuses on deep cleansing. This mask will absorb the excess sebum, leaving you with clearer skin with purified, tighter pores. Hydrating and soothing masks are ideal for reinforcing the hydrolipidic film that protects the skin and obtaining a radiant, plump complexion. All skin types need this kind of treatment. A mask is also much richer and thicker than a day cream, making it possible to target certain skin conditions immediately. How is your offering of facial masks organised? J.K. Hwang - Our range is very broad. It ranges from non-woven to cotton, which has a soft, uniform surface, to rayon, where different natural substances are used for the fibre. It looks translucent when pre-moistened. The texture is soft and adheres easily to the skin. By 2030, all plastic packaging in the European Union will have to be recyclable or reusable. As a result, our mask sachets are made from a single material (polypropylene) and recyclable. Beyond facial masks, you also propose patches? J.K. Hwang - Patches are a very effective technique for treating wrinkles, for example. The main cause of skin ageing is the decline and shrinkage of muscle and elastic fibres in the dermis. The dermis consists of dense collagen and hyaluronic acid. In ageing skin the connection between collagen and hyaluronic acid is less effective. And, wrinkles form as the skin’s elasticity diminishes. Ultra-thin and very comfortable, hydrogel patches provide a moisturising and revitalising effect. They are thin and ergonomic for optimal comfort and do not lint."
A dealmaking rush? European beauty braces for ’super dynamic’ 2024,"Nader Naeymi-Rad, founder and publisher of Beauty Independent, said: “A lot has changed in the beauty industry over the last ten years, and one of the things that has changed is dealmaking.” Referencing data from various sources, Naeymi-Rad said it was clear the volume of beauty deals worldwide had increased year after year in the last decade, coming “back with a vengeance” post-COVID. And whilst dealmaking had slowed in 2023, the overall value of deals in the space broadly followed the upward trajectory of volumes, he said. Carving up dealmaking geographically, he said, there were interesting trends to be seen. The US, for example, remained “very very strong with early-stage dealmaking” whereas European deals tended to happen “in the middle”, at private equity (PE) investment or merger and acquisition (M&A) stages. So, why was investment at early-stage less frequent in European beauty? Vasiliki Petrou, group CEO of beauty major Unilever Prestige, told attendees: “Obviously, we are in a very volatile period of high interest rates, there are a lot of geopolitical tensions and strategics have bought quite a bit (…) I can definitely see a stress on what we call ’indie’ brands because funding is much more difficult versus what it used to be.” Michael Brousset, founder and CEO of beauty and wellness funding and incubator platform Waldencast, added: “There’s also been the factor of the ability for brands to scale – it’s just become a much more competitive market. There are less of those breakout starts, there are still some, but beauty is a business where there are more brands than buyers.” “...I think there are also a lot more options for venture capital (VC) funding in the US beauty space than there are in Europe: there are dedicated funds. And the VC ecosystem is evolving in Europe but it’s probably five to ten years behind the US, so that would explain why there are more PE deals than VC deals,” Brousset said. Emily Bullman, investor at UK VC investment fund JamJar Investments, said European founders also tended to be “slightly more cautious” with fundraising approaches than their US counterparts. Dominic Hawksley, founder of UK luxury beauty oils company Olverum, self-funded since 2015, agreed: “Americans have a greater appetite for risk generally; they are perhaps influenced by the tech sector more. There are also far more funds.” Hawksley said the barriers to growth in Europe due to varied taxation laws, patchwork regulations and the diversity of beauty and retail cultures across the continent might also be a factor. “The situation is that caution extends to the retailers too; you have to prove yourself [as a brand],” he said. Evan Merali, managing director at US independent investment bank Raymond James, said 2023 had also continued to see some uncertainty around consumer spending in beauty, describing it as a “wait and see” year for the true outcome of pattern changes. However, Merali said fewer, albeit strategic, beauty deals had also created a rising desire to invest amongst the financial world. “The interesting thing about mergers and acquisitions, driven by private equity more than strategics, is that as time goes by without any deals, there is a lot of pressure to do deals. And so, things started to pick up on the front half of the year,” he said. Looking ahead, he said even more dealmaking was expected in the first half of 2024. Brousset said the future of beauty – particularly the next 12-18 months – looked “exciting”. “There are a lot of brands coming to market; there is a lot of growth; a lot of consumer excitement. So, I think it’s going to be super dynamic.” “...The beauty business has always been an acquisition business; we’re still talking about substantial, healthy numbers.” Unilever Prestige’s Petrou agreed: “I’m very bullish; I’ve signed up to double-digit growth internally. Beauty has always been very resilient. Beauty is part of our self-confidence [and linked to] self-esteem, and that’s why I think it’s such a beautiful category to be a part of.” So, what categories were set to see more financial dynamism than others in Europe? Jane Carlson, managing editor at Beauty Independent, said fragrance had been “the dark horse” of beauty for the past three to four years, “growing at rates no-one really expected to see”, and would continue to be important in growth terms. It had also seen some “high profile” and “high value” deals in Europe already made, including Creed-Kering Beauté and Aesop-L’Oréal, Carlson said, with “a lot of white space” remaining for growth in Eastern Europe and across prestige. Hanadi Al Hamoui, managing director at investment management firm Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said luxury fragrances could be described as “the really hot category of the moment”, though warned there were probably only “a handful of openings” in this space from an investment point of view. Thomas Buisson, managing director at Natura &Co’s corporate venture investment arm Fable Investments, said growth in this category also took time, so it wasn’t a beauty space that offered “quick-wins” for investors. “It’s a category that has immense potential but I just want to reiterate that you need to accept that it takes time,” Buisson said. Petrou said Unilever Prestige would be looking closely at fragrances when considering future investments, though any deals in the category would be with “really rare” brands that already had some level of scale. Beauty Independent’s Naeymi-Rad said that, beyond brand investments, dealmaking would likely continue across industry’s global supply chain in 2024 – following plenty of deals made across packaging, product development, ingredients and more in recent years. Hui Chan, managing director for private equity at global private investment major Bain Capital, said drivers behind beauty supply chain investments were no different to why companies chose to invest in beauty brands. “Beauty is a phenomenal space; I think it’s incredibly dynamic. But when you step back, if you compare to other consumer spaces, it’s a very growth-filled space. As an investor looking to deploy capital in parts of the market that are attractive, one of the ways to expose yourself to beauty headwinds is investing in the suppliers to these brands,” Chan said. Investing in the “ecosystem of enablers”, she said, offered strong diversification for investors via exposure to multiple brands. Sara Hudson, partner at global management consulting firm McKinsey & Co, said that for now, however, there remained more supplier dealmaking in the US versus Europe, likely due to the European market being made up of smaller, family-owned businesses less keen to sell. Chan agreed, stating this supplier market fragmentation was also likely being maintained because European beauty brands recognised the benefits of working with a plethora of smaller specialists."
Greek dermocosmetics brand The Skin Pharmacist expands to Europe,"“Citizens confronted to minor health problems, in particular skin problems, usually turn to their pharmacists to find a solution. And this behaviour has become more widespread since the Covid-19 pandemic. Consumers see pharmacists as trustworthy health professionals,” explains George Bakas, President of the group Good Brands & Cosmetics (GBC), the French distributor of the brand The Skin Pharmacist. “As The Skin Pharmacist is about to enter the French market, the GBC group has committed to putting more emphasis on pharmacists’ expertise and advice, by offering efficient solutions to frequent skin problems on a daily basis. The brand will provide a first, immediate answer to consumers, before they go see a dermatologist,” adds George Bakas. The Skin Pharmacist’s product offering is composed of five basic face ranges, plus an SOS line of five products designed to relieve the skins that suffer from different disorders (pimples, stings or bites, burns...). The products are available for 17 euros on average, so they are affordable. The formulas are free from silicone, alcohol, mineral oil and colourants, and they are soaked with well-known actives highly popular among consumers, like vitamins C, E, and B12, hyaluronic acid, panthenol, medicinal plant extracts... Launched in January 2022 in Greece, its country of origin, The Skin Pharmacist will expand its presence to several European countries, starting from the end of December, and it will all start in France. Then, Laboratoires Intermed will gradually launch the brand in Spain, Belgium, Germany, Italy, and the UK throughout the year 2024. “In France, we would like to be established enough on the national network in two years to be accessible to as many people as possible,” says Georges Bakas. “The Skin Pharmacist’s DNA involves our being as close as possible to humans, i.e. pharmacists and their customers. That is what we focus our investments on, through face-to-face and continuous training in the form of an e-learning programme and animations at points of sale. We will not develop much on the Web, but of course, a French website will be available by the end of the year.” The Skin Pharmacist’s offering was designed to provide targeted solutions to various skin problems. The products in the Hydra Boost range were developed to deeply hydrate the skin and visibly enhance its texture. As for the formulas in the Sensitive Skin range, they are hypoallergenic and meant to meet the needs of sensitive skins of all ages. The Age Active range was devised to prevent and treat fine lines and wrinkles, while the Restore & Renew line helps intensely regenerate the skin. The City Detox skincare range helps detoxify and protect the skin from premature ageing caused by pollution and UV rays. Lastly, “the SOS line is a unique category in pharmacies, as these products offer fast, immediate relief by treating various skin disorders,” concludes Georges Bakas. The brand The Skin Pharmacist will attend the PharmagoraPlus show in March 2024 in Paris."
"“We are aiming to regain the sense of community,” Annabelle Baker, Lush","It’s been two years since Lush left social networks. Any regrets? Annabelle Baker - It hasn’t been without its challenges. However, how can you regret a decision to try to make your customers safer and one that was made in the light of damaging evidence that platforms like Instagram drove young people to suicide? Over the last two years we have seen significant momentum both with the public and with governments to tackle the issues and force change. It’s encouraging to see new regulations coming into effect across Europe to protect the safety of those on the platforms — what we’d also like to see is more accountability for Big Tech. Our latest campaign — that launched on Black Friday — challenges the power and abuses of Big Tech and raises money for a decentralized movement called ‘People vs Big Tech’. Has this decision had an impact on sales and the brand’s reputation around the world?  Annabelle Baker - Determining the impact on sales has been difficult for a number of reasons. Our withdrawal from social networks coincided with a period of unforeseen global turbulence, with an increase in Covid cases, followed by the invasion of Ukraine and, more recently, a cost-of-living crisis with significant inflation. We are fortunate to have a strong community, which means that our reputation is not determined by our presence or absence on certain social platforms. In fact, we’ve seen other brands try to run a similar active campaign on social networks, only to be asked by their customers why they didn’t do the same as Lush and actively withdraw from these platforms. Have you had any negative feedback from some customers? Annabelle Baker - Our customers have generally been behind what we did and appreciate us taking a stand. We did a report with foresight consultancy The Future Laboratory this year to investigate the digital landscape, now and in the future. With leading experts in the tech sector contributing, and over 12,000 consumers across the UK, US and Japan surveyed, the aim was to investigate the rapidly shifting digital landscape, its impact on consumers, and existing barriers to digital transformation. The results were insightful, for example: almost seven in 10 adults (69%) believe that if a social media platform is unethical then brands should step away from it; 65% don’t want social media platforms to use their data for commercial benefit; whilst a huge 70% are calling for global legislation that protects the safety of users online. So your departure from social networking went smoothly? Annabelle Baker - It hasn’t all been that way though, we definitely did receive comments from people not appreciating our stance but this was two years ago when the dangers of social media were not as well known or as well documented as they are today. Just this week, the BBC published a story about Gen Z turning their backs on social media and you can also see waves of legal action in the US from families accusing these platforms of being harmful to teens, in particular. It’s important to note that these social media platforms are not the only space to build connection and community and we are likely to continue to see a decentralized approach to community building and how and where a brand can show up. A few months ago, there was a bit of a viral element on social media that saw some users claiming to have (almost) forgotten that Lush existed. Isn’t that a problem in a sector that is subject to ever-increasing competition? Annabelle Baker - You have to keep yourself relevant, and we are fortunate to have a lot of creativity and innovation in our business. If you make bold moves, tap into popular culture, invent groundbreaking products that are effective and really change lives, and interact with your community consistently and authentically, then a brand can stay relevant. Remembering that people buy from people. What has the brand done to remain visible to consumers despite this absence on social networks? Annabelle Baker - Lush is still present in the digital world — yes, we’ve moved off of Meta platforms and TikTok as a brand, but we’ve been experimenting with other web3 technologies and platforms. We are aiming to regain the ""sense of community"" in online spaces, when social media was really social and when our Lush community was organic — before the algorithm took over the direct connection between Lush and users. There’re other ways to meet communities where they are, that isn’t dependent on these platforms. For example we’ve been dipping our toe into the metaverse this past year, with a replica of our SXSW House activation on Decentraland and taking part in the first Metaverse Beauty Week. As part of our ’Big Tech Rebellion,’ we are keen to divest money away from the likes of Google and instead invest in our community, people over platforms. This ranges from looking at how we collaborate with influencers and creators, to offering our super fans a first look at product drops. Have you initiated other forms of ’meetups’ with your community? Annabelle Baker - We’ve been participating in more IRL events and activations, showing up at events like Afro Punk in Brooklyn; Happy Place Festival in the UK; SXSW in Austin and Womad in the UK. We have physical retail spaces all over the world, and have continued to invest in redesigns and refits, as well as new concept stores — such as a new hair salon in the UK and spas in Dubai and NYC. We’ve been collaborating with lifestyle and entertainment partners more over the past 12 months and our community has jumped on these, creating many viral moments across all launches (including the ""Super Mario Bros Movie,"" ""Stranger Things,"" ""SpongeBob"" and most recently ""Barbie""). When you do something cool that excites people, we’ve found that our audience will organically share it and that’s more authentic. So that’s our job, create those products and experiences that our community wants to share! We’ve also been building our community on Discord with the intention to make more ""conversational"" interaction with customers online. Discord is a decentralised platform and allows us to have more control within the server. In the fashion world, Bottega Veneta has left Instagram, but very few brands seem to be able to go without a social network presence. Why do you think this is? Annabelle Baker - I can’t comment on what other brands do or why, I can only talk about why we made the decisions we did. Coming off of the platforms we did made sense to us, as a lot of our customers fall into the group most negatively affected by them. We are in the business of well-being, and we attract a lot of young girls … we simply couldn’t continue to ask them to find us on platforms [that push us] into giving our “consent” to grow their vast empires of personal data extraction and surveillance. They then leave us to deal with the detrimental effects of this business model, which can mean a devastating impact on mental health and well-being. These platforms are literally the antithesis of what we stand for and are themselves anti-social. That’s why we are currently working with an organization called People vs Big Tech, to raise money for them to continue their work to rein in the Big Tech companies. We’re selling a bath bomb called The Cloud, with all the sales price (minus the VAT) going towards starting a global youth network to reclaim social media from Big Tech. Would you say today that Lush will never return to social networks, whatever the consequences? Annabelle Baker - We would potentially, however we would need to see a complete change to the social media landscape. For us we would need to see accountability of these Big Tech companies who seem to act without regard for users’ welfare despite overwhelming evidence that their services are doing a lot of harm. It would be a change of mindset and design on these social media platforms."
"“We want to become the makeup expert”, Gianluca Toniolo, Dolce&Gabbana Beauty","Premium Beauty News – What is your strategic objective with direct management, compared to the license system? Gianluca Toniolo - These two approaches involve different objectives. Direct management will help to elevate the beauty category to the same level of the other brand’s products and build up a brand, whereas the license follows a more commercial approach. Dolce&Gabbana is the first Italian fashion company to have decided to directly manage its beauty category. And that is what Domenico and Stefano wanted; for them, it is a 30-year dream come true. Already at the beginning of their career they wanted to develop a beauty line, but they couldn’t afford it. They see beauty products as essential fashion accessories, the finishing touch - of perfume or make-up - to enhance an outfit. Premium Beauty News - How are you planning to build up the Dolce&Gabbana Beauty brand? Gianluca Toniolo - We have defined a very clear strategy. We want to elevate the category with new products. For example, we launched the Devotion fragrance only a few months ago, and it is already among the Top 3 best-selling products. With a name as evocative as its composition, this perfume is a powerful expression of the brand’s DNA, that is a great asset. We have the unique opportunity to work alongside the fashion division, create a direct link between these two territories, and shape up a unique, strong brand for consumers. As a result, for example, Devotion, characterized by the sacred heart, is a whole family of products: fragrance, make-up, bags and accessories, and a fine jewellery collection. So, our different categories will speak the same language and share the same codes. Lastly, another important objective is to engage with new, younger consumers. They will be able to enter the world of the brand through products with a lower price point to then discover other categories and, potentially, purchase them. Premium Beauty News - How would you define Dolce&Gabbana’s DNA? Gianluca Toniolo - The brand embraces different values and codes, the most important being Italianness. Just like fashion, beauty products have Italian know-how; we only work with the best local artisans and producers. Premium Beauty News - Dolce&Gabbana Beauty is 100% made in Italy, then. Who are your partners? Gianluca Toniolo - For perfumes we mainly collaborate with two Italian companies: ICR Cosmetics, which boasts 70 years of experience in this category, and Cosmint, which belongs to the Intercos group, for make-up. Intercos is not just an industrial partner, in fact Dolce&Gabbana holds 8% of the floating capital. Among other partners, Ancorotti, leader in mascara. Lombardy has many excellent suppliers in the segment! Premium Beauty News - Which categories would you like to put forward? Gianluca Toniolo - We are targeting two segments, namely perfumes and cosmetics; we aim to become a best-selling global cosmetics brand. Starting from March 2024, we will relaunch the catalogue of the category with a new quality line that boasts the Italian excellence of our partners, a unique storytelling and the iconic lifestyle embodied by our DNA. The new line will include 180 references by the end of 2024 and will reach 300 by the end of 2025. Our goal is to become the make-up experts with a range that covers all skin types, in all regions of the world. We will enter the skincare category in 2025, but through make-up, and always with Italian partners. Premium Beauty News - How have you structured the company to go global? Gianluca Toniolo - 270 people from 27 different countries were recruited in less than eight months: 130 at the Milan headquarters, and 140 in our subsidiaries all over the world. We set up six subsidiaries, the largest being in Miami, where 70 employees directly manage the North and South American markets which are priority for us, because the brand is very strong there. The second subsidiary is based in Dubai, so we can easily manage the Middle East, and then we have Singapore for the Asia-Pacific region, as well as Paris, Milan, and Spain. Premium Beauty News - What about your retail distribution strategy? Gianluca Toniolo - On one hand there is the network of selective perfumeries and on the other we have the strategy of opening our own boutiques dedicated to beauty. The first has just opened in Hong Kong, at the end of the month there will be Indonesia and beauty flagships are planned in the main capitals of the world. There is also a digital strategy with the e-retail business of perfumeries. Finally, we want to dedicate important beauty spaces, approximately 25-30 m2, in around thirty of our main fashion stores around the world. We have already inaugurated these spaces in two emblematic Milanese shops, Via della Spiga and Via Montenapoleone. Dolce&Gabbana stands out from other fashion houses by dedicating important space to beauty. The founders really consider beauty as an important complement to fashion and want to direct the brand towards a lifestyle profile; we have also launched products for the home and collaborations in the food and drink sector. Premium Beauty News - Can you take stock of your first year? Gianluca Toniolo - The turnover has almost doubled since we will close 2023 with around 1.5 billion euros, while we started from 800 thousand euros. In the thirty years of licensing, the results have never been so good. This project is therefore a success, and it is supported by distributors and vendors who appreciate the strategy. They consider us pioneers. But making such a decision took a lot of courage, as entry barriers are very high. Dolce&Gabbana has invested more than 400 million euros to take over the category and finance it, but it is an investment from which the entire group will benefit."
Alexandre.J makes its mark on the ultra-niche perfume market,"Alexandre.J, it is the choice of a strong visual identity! The brand has opted for an assertive DNA, with bottles crafted and shaped using noble materials. It is a way of giving the object a touch of sensuality and desirability. Alexandre.J also relies on a clear olfactory bias, to open the doors of a prestigious and confidential perfumery to the public. The brand’s strong visual identity is promoted via social networks, thanks both to the expertise of a creative team trained at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and to a community of dedicated followers. In 2016, the brand was distributed in 37 countries and 1,000 points of sales. Today, it is present in 85 countries and 3,000 points of sale, with a fairly even distribution, since the brand is active in the Middle East, Europe, Eastern European markets, and Latin America (Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Peru, and Colombia). In Europe, Alexandre.J has 116 points of sale in Italy, around 40 in Spain and 10 in Germany. In France, it is distributed in 25 boutiques and plans to reopen its own shop in Paris in 2024. Alexandre.J is a family-run business, but it is also very close to its distributors, attentive to the specific characteristics of each market to which the brand adapts its offer. This agility is due in particular to the size of its range. Since 2012, Alexandre.J has launched around 200 products, a wide range that enables it to cover different segments of the confidential perfume market. The brand features products priced at 133 euros in its The Collector range, as well as more costly perfumes in its Art Nouveau Collection, and an extensive range of amateur pieces in the Atelier d’Artistes Collection. With the Art Nouveau Collection, launched last year, Alexandre J. is celebrating a time of great modernity. Hence the desire to explore new accords without turning its back on traditional perfumery. True to its original partners, the brand called on Studio Flair and perfumer Vanina Muracciole to work on original, addictive notes: date, a patchouli-raspberry accord, and oud freshened by jatamansi wood. Five eaux de parfums in hand-chiselled, sculpted 100 ml glass bottles with magnetic caps, priced at 370 euros. The Collection will soon be joined by a new floral fragrance. The brand has created some Extraits for each of its fragrances. A new 50% concentration for each fragrance, in which certain facets have been enhanced. These extracts are available in a 25 ml format, for 270 euros. The same care has been taken with the bottle, with the case signed by designer Lola Mercier. For the end-of-year festivities, Alexandre.J unveils its Art Nouveau Case. The epitome of luxury, a limited edition of 250 pieces worldwide, priced at 2,600 euros. This unique presentation case, specially designed for perfume collectors, contains the entire collection - eau de parfum and extracts. Alexandre.J has established itself as an accessible luxury perfumery but is now extending its offering to include upmarket products for a demanding clientele. It is a way of targeting every stratum of confidential perfumery, from Haute Parfumerie to Ultra Niche Perfumery."
"“Zero-waste will require cooperation,” says The Body Shop’s Georgie Coppin","The Body Shop began rolling out its refill concept in 2021. After two years, can you say whether this is a viable concept in terms of demand? Georgie Coppin - We’ve long been leaders in the ethical beauty sector, so our customers expect these kinds of innovations and packaging solutions from us. I think customers want brands to help them live more sustainably, and our refill stations are all about making it easier for people to reduce their impact on the planet, by making refilling convenient and easily accessible. We’re definitely continuing to see a demand for these alternatives — 29.5% of customers have returned to re-purchase a refill since the launch of our refill stations, which is a higher repeat purchase rate than our plastic bottles (24.3%). We were also getting a lot of feedback from customers that they wanted more products to be available as a refill. So, this year we expanded our refill offering from shampoos, conditioners and shower gels to also include our makeup range. We now offer a refillable lipstick and a refillable foundation powder too. The brand is present in over 80 countries, so are refills available everywhere? Georgie Coppin - Yes! We are rolling out our refill stations globally. And our aim is to have a station in all of our eligible stores around the world by the end of 2024. However, refilling has not yet completely replaced plastic bottles, which are still available in stores. Georgie Coppin - We know that as a business we need to do more to help our planet, and our refill stations are just one part of our mission to help build a circular economy. This desire to be the best ethical, sustainable, inclusive company that we can be is at the very heart of everything we do. It’s what guides us as a business. Currently, half of The Body Shop’s plastic packaging comes from pre-existing plastic waste, with part of it coming from our partnership with Plastics For Change, one of our Community Fair Trade partners. Through this partnership we work with 2,000 waste collectors in India who receive fair prices for the plastic waste they collect, as well as access to better working conditions, and other social benefits. We’ve now collected 100 million plastic bottles (and counting) from the streets of India. Solids, refills and the banning of single-use products are among the solutions being considered in France to move towards a zero-waste bathroom. Are other solutions being considered elsewhere? Georgie Coppin - In some countries, customers can return their used cosmetics bottles to be cleaned and either re-used or recycled anywhere that it is possible to purchase beauty products. This makes refilling even more accessible to consumers. However, this would require collaboration between brands, either voluntarily or enforced by legislation. The concept of a zero-waste bathroom is only possible through a collaborative effort between businesses, governments and consumers. Why aren’t things moving faster? Georgie Coppin - When we were developing our refill program, we carried out a survey to get a sense of consumers’ attitudes towards refill solutions. We found that one of the main things preventing customers from switching to refills was convenience. That’s why we set out to make refilling a convenient and easily accessible option that people could make part of their daily life, by aiming to have a refill station in all our eligible stores globally (even the smaller, more remote shops) by the end of 2024. Customers still want to enjoy the experience of using beauty products and aren’t always willing to sacrifice this for the planet. So, for us, it’s about making the product that creates the least waste easy by providing education on why refills are the best option. Can inflation be a brake on this ecological transition? Georgie Coppin - Inflation can definitely have an impact on developing and implementing these sorts of sustainable innovations for businesses. For The Body Shop, this is no different. However, our purpose; to fight for a fairer and more beautiful world, is our North Star, and reminds us that these efforts to reduce our impact on the planet are even more important during difficult times. For customers, those who engage in our refill scheme actually save money. So whilst inflation could be a blocker to them, we are doing what we can to make refilling financially attractive to consumers. When you buy a refill from us, you pay the same price as our standard 250ml plastic bottle version, but you get an extra 50ml of product for free each time. Is the zero-waste bathroom a utopia or the future of beauty? Georgie Coppin - Refills and packaging solutions are certainly a step in the right direction but getting to zero-waste can only be achieved through a collaborative effort between businesses, governments and consumers. All parties need to reach a common understanding and work together with this shared goal in mind if we are to achieve this."
Coelho Beauty joins the holistic scalp care band-wagon with new range,"Long before the scalp skinification trend, as hair care formulas were just starting to get more natural, in 2017, Adrien Coelho decided to create products meant to be at the root of hair beauty. “As a trained hairdresser, I have always been passionate about hair beauty and health. As part of my job, I realized everyone had the same problems with dull, brittle, weakened hair. And since they did not know how to treat their hair properly, they blindly trusted the industry, although it targeted the symptoms, not the causes,” he says. “Consumers are much better educated about skincare than scalp care, and yet the latter ages six times faster than the face skin,” he adds. Back from a training course in the United States, he started to develop natural formulas with a pharmacist specialized in skin problems to offer both efficacy and sensoriality. “To me, it was essential to formulate products free from aggressive and controversial ingredients. I wanted to work on natural formulas and treat the scalp like we treat our skins, with essential oils for their emotional dimension, because our hair reflects our emotions,” explains Adrien Coelho. His work resulted in four products composed of at least 95% of multifunctional ingredients of natural origin, like the serum-oil for the scalp, hair, face and body, which offers relaxing, antioxidant and anti-ageing benefits. Coelho is claimed to be a high-end, holistic brand which supports consumers in a comprehensive way. “I felt like combining sensoriality – with woody, spicy fragrances – and efficacy. It took four years to develop these very pleasant, foaming textures,” explains Adrien Coelho. Other than the serum-oil, the range boasts a micellar cleanser which can be used as a shampoo, a peppermint-based 4-in-1 cleansing, defining, conditioning moisturizer which can also be used as a mask, and a texturizing memory mist. The multifunctional approach is in line with an urban lifestyle that lacks space and time, and it minimizes waste. These minimalist formulas suit all hair types, and both men and women. “We aim to go back to basics, with simplified routines, but optimum results, while preserving nature and hair health,"" he says. Launched last September, the range is available on the Coelho Beauty e-shop as well as in Oh My Cream stores. Prices range from 68 euros for the oil to 38 euros for the shampoo. Adrien Coelho aims to enter new markets soon, in particular the US and Brazil, and to broaden the range by targeting specific hair concerns. “To be differentiating, I intend to develop highly targeted products focused on particular problems: eczema, hair loss, and thin or coloured hair. Of course, it is a booming segment, but everyone has pretty much the same offers, for curly and textured hair. We need to stand out by exploring and specializing in other areas. The pandemic made consumers feel like taking care of their hair again, and their expectations have got increasingly precise. It is time to satisfy them. My approach is meant to be educational, so that we go farther regarding hair treatment. The idea is to provide a highly customized solution to each hair problem, thanks to a targeted, expert range”, concludes Adrien Coelho."

Fragrance Creators looks towards the future during its 2023 Annual Meeting,"The main trade association representing the U.S. fragrance industry gathered members and industry stakeholders to celebrate its achievements and to anticipate what is coming around the corner during its 2023 Annual Meeting, held on November 14, at The Chart House in Weehawken, New Jersey. “We focus on helping our members future proof their businesses,” said Farah K. Ahmed, President & CEO, Fragrance Creators Association.  “I am proud that the association is at the forefront of using and developing new tools that optimize data and technology; our first-of-its-kind Data Insights Program will continue to deliver unique insights that empower our future focused agenda for people, perfume, and the planet.” Launched at the beginning of the year, the Fragrance Creators Association’s Data Insights Program has been designed to track, monitor and harvest disparate data points, news, scientific developments, and other information from around the globe with the goal of unmatched forecasting of public policy, regulatory, and consumer and marketplace trends. Other key achievements celebrated at the Annual Meeting included: – prioritizing sound science, including through the publication of a white paper on the importance of comprehensive assessments in evaluating fragrance ingredients;
– advocating for risk-based regulatory systems, including through the submission of dozens of comments to state and federal regulatory bodies;
– providing access to key leaders at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Congress through exclusive meetings with individuals in the EPA Office of New Chemicals and Safer Choice, the FDA Office of Cosmetics and Colors and Office of the Chief Scientist, and in dozens of meetings with Members of Congress during the association’s 2023 annual fly in; and,
– advancing whole-of-industry stewardship by launching the Responsible Industry Stewardship pledge and advancing policies that support bringing sustainable innovation to market.

They also shared perspectives on the 2024 election cycle. In addition, attendees heard from EPA’s Acting Director of the New Chemicals Division, Shari Barash, as she shared EPA’s perspectives and insights on the New Chemicals Program and potential ways it can be improved. This built upon ongoing advocacy work by Fragrance Creators to encourage the approval of newer, greener fragrance ingredients at EPA. The meeting wrapped up with a consumer focus. During the last session, media and consumer insights experts Maria Burquest and Jennifer James shared consumer data, discussed ever-evolving consumer trends, and the impact that technology is having now and in the future. They emphasized that being finely attuned to societal shifts and emerging trends is vital to succeeding in today’s marketplace and how sustainable sourcing, ingredient knowledge, online shopping, and AI experiences are changing the way consumers shop. During the meeting, Fragrance Creators members voted to confirm the 2024 Board of Directors Slate. Fragrance Creators was pleased to announce its 2024 leadership – with Cynthia Reichard, Executive Vice President of Arylessence and Robert Weinstein, PhD, CEO of Robertet USA continuing to co-chair the organization. “Together, art and science have always pushed society towards brighter futures,” said Weinstein. “With a deeper understanding of the intersection of regulatory and consumer trends, Fragrance Creators remains optimally positioned to advocate for policies and regulatory pathways that enhance the fragrance industry’s ability to bring newer, greener innovation to market.” “Fragrance Creators’ strong sense of purpose — to serve as responsible stewards — is what brings us together, and helps drive inclusivity, respect, and consensus building throughout our diverse membership,” said Reichard. “The association’s use of data and technology has allowed us to operationalize our purpose more efficiently and deliver results more effectively.”"
Anjac expands into luxury fragrance with Stephid acquisition in France,"After two acquisitions in Canada — Pillar5 and Apollo, in 2022 — the manufacturer of cosmetic products, medical devices, drugs and food supplements is expending its portfolio by taking over Stephid, a French company specializing in the manufacture of luxury perfumes, and high-end custom filling and packing. Founded in 1989 and based in Pont-Sainte-Maxence, in northern France, at about 50 kilometres from Paris, Stephid has a unique expertise in small production runs and luxury products that resembles craftsmanship and tailoring. The company benefits from strong relationships with luxury fragrance houses and designers, thanks to its mastery of cutting-edge techniques that are crucial to preserving the most fragile top notes. The company carries out the entire perfume manufacturing process, from maturing the concentrate to glazing the fragrance in polished stainless steel tanks from 100 to 3,000 litres, with a total capacity of 20,000 litres. Stephid also has the know-how to fill bottles and assemble the packaging and accessories relying on very precise manual skills. The company is therefore able to process small series (few dozen of units) as well as thousands of units. “The teams also are also recognized for their distribution expertise of finished goods throughout the world and from every aspect of the logistical value chain,” says Anjac in a press release. Stephid partners with more than 60 well-known fragrance brands and should achieve a turnover of nearly 15 million euros in 2023, with a double-digit growth compared to last year. With this operation, Anjac strengthens its offering on the luxury markets providing cutting-edge and tailor-made services and processes services with high added value, in particular for the high-end and niche perfume segment, which is extremely dynamic. “Anjac will be able to benefit from Stephid’s cutting-edge expertise in top-of-the- range manufacturing, packaging and kitting, with unique, tailor-made services of the highest quality. The Group is thus expanding its offering, providing additional expertise to support its customer portfolio regarding their cosmetics and perfumes ranges,” highlights the company. Furthermore, Anjac’s support will enable Stephid to expand its investment and production capacity and thus meet the growing demands of its customers. After Cosmetix West and Feltor in 2019, Roval Cosmétiques in 2020, Apollo and Pillar5 in 2022, Stephid is Anjac’s 10th acquisition within the span of 6 years, doubling its turnover in 5 years. Anjac now includes 15 companies, with 22 R&D and manufacturing sites, and a turnover approaching EUR 700 million. Financial terms have not been disclosed, but Anjac said that Stephid’s management team and governance remain in place."
Sephora seeks to boost business expansion in India with new partner,"Sephora, which made its first foray into India in 2012, today counts 26 stores across 13 cities. To boost its operations in a country, which is widely seen as the next growth hot spot for the cosmetics industry, the prestige beauty retailer has tied up a new partnership with Reliance Retail Ventures Limited (RRVL), the largest retailer in India, owned by billionaire Mukesh Ambani. As part of the partnership with Sephora, Reliance Beauty & Personal Care Limited – a wholly owned subsidiary of RRVL — will take over Sephora’s current India operations from Arvind Fashions Limited, which was Sephora’s partner for the last eight years. The transaction is valued at INR 990.2 million, about EUR 11.1 million. The buyout gives Reliance Retail Ventures exclusive rights to build and enhance Sephora’s presence in India across all channels. ""Rising affluence, increasing urbanisation and the proliferation of social media have driven greater awareness of self-care and beauty, unlocking major opportunities for prestige beauty. It is an opportune time for us to invest in expanding our presence, and bring new, exciting, and exclusive brands to delight our growing community of beauty enthusiasts,"" said Alia Gogi, Asia President, Sephora. The Indian beauty and personal care market pegged at USD 17 billion (EUR 15,8 billion) and set to grow at a 11% CAGR [1], is still believed to be in its infancy; positioning India as one of the largest untapped consumer markets globally. According to a recent study by Kearney and Luxe Asia, prestige beauty markets in Southeast Asia and India are poised to enter a decade of double-digit growth, and the market could triple in size. These perspectives have trigger a strong struggle among beauty retailers in India, including Nykaa, Tira, Sephora and Shoppers Stop. The attractiveness of the market also sparkled recent high-profile moves in the country by brands such as Shiseido and Nars. ""The burgeoning Indian beauty market is being propelled by a new generation of customers with a strong desire to express their individuality, rising aesthetic refinement and a growing number of women in the young workforce of India. The Indian consumerism journey is at a tipping point, providing the perfect tail wind to this partnership,” said V Subramaniam, Director, Reliance Retail Ventures Limited."
Pigmentarium puts the Czech Republic on the world perfume map,"The name of the brand, Pigmentarium, refers to the world of painting and to the Latin inscriptions that dot the façades of Prague’s main buildings, and the brand’s concept involves capturing the richness of the city in a fragrance. “Each fragrance is related to an artist or a cultural discovery. Pigmentarium does not see itself as a perfume brand, because it is focused on the art of living; it is a platform that also connects Czech artists and craftspeople to highlight the treasures of Prague. Through our collaborations, we also play a curatorial role with regard to young artists”, explains Tomas Ric, the founder. “Our path is related to human encounters and artistic affinities.” Pigmentarium is actually stepping up its collaborations with young international artists: poet Michaela Fenkl, sculptor Pauline Hagant, or fashion designer Arturo Obegero, all of whom have become ambassadors for the brand. The young perfume company has built itself a visual universe that is easily identifiable and influenced by the fashion world, which is where the artistic director comes from. This is conveyed by the aesthetics of the campaigns associated with the fragrances. Imagery is one of the pillars on which Pigmentarium’s communication is based. “During the Covid pandemic, the work we did on imagery opened new doors for us, by generating interest before even smelling the perfumes,” says Tomas Ric. His stint in fashion also enabled him to unveil the limited edition of the Azabache perfume at the Paris Fashion Week, in 2021, reaching new targets. “Right from the start, we were supported by major global magazines like Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar and Elle... And also by Ingredients, the leading niche perfume store in Prague [1]: they believed in us from our very first fragrance”, he explains. Right now, the bottles are available in niche perfume stores in Prague, alongside French and global high-end perfume names. It has been a great journey for the founder, who says he initially invested his own money in the creation of the first opus, Ad Libitum. He collaborated with Czech independent perfumer Jakub F. Hiermann (co-founder who recently left the company), who created the series of the brand’s first six perfumes. “At first, we developed these fragrances at a fast pace to be able to build up a portfolio. Now, we are following a different tempo with one launch a year”, says Tomas Ric. “The company doubles its turnover every year and our workforce has grown from three to seven employees. Also, I recently turned down several investment offers. We want to control our growth and keep our independence and initial state of mind, which is conveyed by the name of our first fragrance Ad Libitum”, he emphasizes. Right now, the Pigmentarium brand is present in 14 countries and 40 points of sale, in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, of course, but also across Europe. It is distributed by the Burmunk chain in the Armenian capital and has begun to conquer the Far East, starting with Uzbekistan. In Paris, it is available at Nose and Elevator. Tomas Ric explains that “For each fragrance launch, we make a point of organizing a presentation in Paris, because this capital is essential for international recognition. We are supported by the Czech Embassy and Cultural Centre.” Pigmentarium also boasts a dedicated table at the Prague International Airport, which provides visibility alongside new local brands emblematic of the Czech art of living and creativity (fashion, design, fire arts, etc.). But the company aims to go global. “We have just signed an agreement with distributors based in Dubai”, Tomas reveals. “Pigmentarium’s olfactory style is in line with the tastes of the Gulf countries,” confirms Théo Belmas, perfumer-creator at Symrise. “This new fragrance marks a transition. It is part of a new dynamic,” says Tomas Ric, who chose to partner with French perfumer-creator Théo Belmas for his seventh fragrance, Oratorio. Invited to take an outside look at the city of Prague, Théo Belmas suggested immortalizing a poetic moment experienced during the visit of a magnificent Baroque church: the vision of a cloud of incense pierced by a ray of light. The fragrance takes shape around dualities: light and shadow, spiritual contemplation and urban effervescence. Théo Belmas delivers an original incense/pressed mandarin chord which crystallizes these sensations by reconciling contrasts. “It is a simple, but very structured formula. A material-oriented fragrance I reworked until it really conveyed a story: that of an almost mystical vision mixed with the city’s energy. The incense is concentrated at 10%, so it fully expresses its richness and complex facets in three oil forms: essential, pyrogenic, and resinoid. The hand-pressed mandarin extract brings out light and joy.” This structure is articulated with Egyptian neroli, both honeyed and animal-like, and with cedarwood from the Atlas mountains and Virginia. The base notes are opoponax and patchouli, with balsamic accents. The Oratorio fragrance reflects the symbiosis of two complementary creative energies. It also marks the strategic rapprochement between the Prague-based brand and Paris."

IL Cosmetics: from a single product to a global offering,"In 2023-2024, over 12 million euros have been invested in expanding production and filling capacities across all their product categories. For makeup, a second bulk production plant is under construction and will be ready by summer 2024, effectively doubling production capacity in that segment. As for the nail category, investments are primarily focused on the new semi-permanent technology. Regarding the turnkey offering, the company has implemented a plan to increase makeup filling capacities with a strong focus on process automation. The goal is to increase capacity by 30-40 million units between 2023-2024. The company’s continued globalization will be achieved through both organic and external growth in two main directions: Product offering expansion This will be achieved through organic growth, including the introduction of semi-permanent products to cover the entire nail category as well as expansion in the make-up category with the arrival of complexion at IL Cosmetics. Additionally, external growth will accelerate the development of new product categories. Geographical expansion Starting with a commercial and industrial presence in North America.

Ultimately, the goal is to offer a complete range of makeup products to satisfy brands seeking a trusted partner capable of supporting them in all their developments."
Pulpe de Vie: the French upcycling pioneer brand expands in Europe,"Founded in Marseille by Julie Ducret in 2009, Pulpe de Vie initially promoted cosmetics made from unsold, inglorious, or incorrectly sized fruit sourced from regional producers. Perfectly in line with the current trends, the concept of upcycling has since been widely adopted: it reached a 30% growth rate in 2023, compared to last year, and a turnover superior to 3 million euros. Available in over 2,000 mass distribution points of sale in France (Carrefour, Casino, Lidl and Intermarché networks) and on its e-shop, pulpedevie.com, the brand now offers 40 organic-certified face care and body hygiene references, all made from downgraded fruit. And they cost less than 12 euros each. “From face care to toothpaste, from solid deodorants to hair care products, we almost cover all bathroom needs now. Every product contains two fruit types, usually combined with two patented actives – in skincare formulas – and prebiotics. Our whole range offers prebiotics to help the skin naturally defend itself. We are the only ones to do that on the mass distribution skincare segment”, explains Julie Ducret. The products are 100% made in France, in one of the brand’s four partner plants. In March 2023, the company raised 1.1 million euros to further boost its growth. This achievement helped double the number of employees, in particular by recruiting sales representatives, reaching 15 employees. Another part of the budget is dedicated to the digitalization of the concept, in the mainstream and social media, and to export. “We opened to export this year, mainly in Europe, with Germany ahead, followed by Italy, Spain, Belgium, and Switzerland. And we are also considering expanding in the UK. We will gradually widen the circle, but we are looking to adopt the most positive model possible in terms of greenhouse gases – and it is not that simple”, says Julie Ducret. The third part of investments is focused on the brand’s ecological transition. “We aim to push our model further, not only to be less polluting, but also to become more regenerative, in particular by taking care of our farmers even better”, explains the entrepreneur. Pulpe de Vie has worked with about 20 local producers for 14 years: the brand has committed to buying two years of stock of unsold fruit to secure their income, which represents 20% additional revenue for them. “We are not just a cosmetic brand. We have a real, extremely strong bond with the land and the living: we have a territorial pact, so we aim to strengthen our local concept. I strongly believe that we will get through all these global warming crises with this local approach, this local cooperation and support”, concludes Julie Ducret."
"How Snow Group revitalised Algotherm, a pioneer in marine cosmetics","Founded in 1962 with the ambition of using natural active ingredients extracted from seawater and seaweed, in cosmetics and beauty dermatology, Algotherm equipped itself in 1970 with a Research & Development Laboratory that was a pioneer in algotherapy and the cosmetic development of ocean resources. Over 60 years, dozens of species of seaweed have been studied and then adopted for use in the composition of high-performance complexes. After a spell with the Gilbert Group and a rather unsuccessful attempt to break into the pharmaceutical sector, the brand is getting back to basics under the aegis of Snow Group, its new owner. Under the Group’s impetus, Algotherm aims to fully reintegrate the professional circuit — institutes and spas — by combining its historical expertise with the development of marine cosmeceuticals based both, on state-of-the-art active ingredients and a clearer definition of its DNA. As the European leader in the creation and management of spas (60 outlets in France and abroad), Snow Group is taking advantage of the combination of three brands with complementary identities: Cinq Mondes, Deep Nature and Algotherm. Within the Group’s cosmetics division, Algotherm intends to become the benchmark in Marine Cosmeceuticals, a crossroads where the brand’s marine expertise (now extended to all the oceanic riches), the innovations of pharmaceutical science and the achievements of cutting-edge medico-aesthetic cosmetology come together. The brand puts the spotlight on its ability to combine bio-assimilable natural marine extracts with market-leading dermatological active ingredients (hyaluronic acid, vitamin C, AHAs, niacinamide...). In 2022, two ranges were reformulated. The Ocean Life range, highly concentrated in the Algogene complex, which was supplemented with various active ingredients such as Bisabolol, Adenosine and Infra-Skin, and the Ocean Time line featuring a retinol-like active ingredient. This reformulation drive will continue in 2023. Eventually, it will cover the entire range, i.e. around sixty products. Paraben-free since 2004, the formulation is now silicone-free, with a minimum of 90% ingredients of natural origin in each formula. The brand boasts many responsible commitments, both in terms of product composition and the manufacture of packaging: short distribution channels, greater use of recycled plastics and glass, FSC-labelled paper and cardboard, double-sided printing on boxes to avoid inserting a leaflet... The brand has adopted a new identity in line with its repositioning. The new logo reflects the brand’s scientific expertise and its move upmarket, while the curves of the lettering suggest the movement of waves. The ocean’s depths are reflected in a colour palette that evokes marine life and naturalness. These shades, in harmony with the packaging, are visible in the interior design of the urban spa recently opened in Lyon. The surroundings combine sandy colours with blue-green spirulina shades. Finally, four colour codes were used to identify each of the product categories: anti-ageing, face expert, body expert and face all-rounders. Finally, the return to basics also entails a reassertion of the brand’s presence on the professional circuit, with Thalasso Deauville Algotherm, the historic flagship where people come to indulge in the benefits of the ocean, and as an emblem of the brand’s revival, the newly opened Dermo Ocean Spa, which has taken up residence near Place Bellecourt in Lyon. Located on two floors, the spa has six treatment rooms, including one double room. Algotherm spas are also opening up to biotechnology with new-generation equipment (LED treatment, cryotherapy or oxygen diffusers) and delivering hyper-personalised treatment protocols: thanks to the Dermoscan, skin therapists carry out an intelligent diagnosis of the needs of each skin type. Protocols are also evolving, with a wide range of face and body treatments, ranging from 15-minute flash treatments to 80-minute expert treatments. In short, a complete range designed to meet the growing demand for expert, personalised treatments."
Cosmetic 360: “The green transition is an innovation challenge”,"Just like every year, the Cosmetic 360 show organized by the Cosmetic Valley will gather decision makers in the cosmetics and perfume industry and focus on a theme intended to delve into a forward-looking issue. The Cleantech theme chosen covers all technologies serving the green transition: decarbonation, waste management, circular economy, biomaterials... “We are committed to highlighting the inspirations, whether they have already found applications or not, that can be useful to the cosmetics and perfume industry and contribute to its progress as regards environmental protection”, explains Franckie Béchereau. This common theme is vivid in the four-session programme of conferences. The first session will deal with new responsible consumption patterns: refills, bulk products, solid formulas... The trends will be highlighted by Beautystream and Euromonitor, among others. The second session will be focused on packaging ecoresponsibility: players like Aptar, Albéa and Minelli Group will share their own experiences. Then, the cosmetics industry decarbonation will be dealt with at the third session, through solutions like the biomass or the energy transition of manufacturing processes. Lastly, biosourced ingredients and technologies nurturing the circular economy will be addressed as part of the fourth session. Players like L’Oréal, Givaudan, LVMH and the Fondation de la Mer will provide their own visions and innovations. In the exhibition zone, various animation areas – both new and long-standing ones – will also be focused on the central theme, putting forward clean technology solutions. The brand new Innovation Center set up in partnership with IDEC, a company which provides support in implementing an energy transition, will gather a series of startups committed to new solutions. “It is a new, very strong area, because the industry is highly concerned with this issue. We will provide solutions to the cosmetics industry’s environmental challenges. The green and energy transition is definitely an innovation and competitiveness issue now”, says the Director. A Cleantech “totem” will help visitors spot the new ecoresponsible solutions showcased by the 250 exhibitors. And this year, a transversal award for the Best Cleantech Innovation will join the Cosmetic 360 Awards that recognize the best innovation in each expert field. The Tech Corner, in partnership with CNRS (The French National Center for Scientific Research), will put the spotlight on a green continuous flow extraction and potentiation technology intended to exacerbate the biological activity of molecules. The Factory will gather suppliers offering solutions to reduce water and energy consumption in the cosmetics industry. And this year, the Startup Station will welcome about 30 young companies developing clean innovations. It is sponsored by Beauty Tech Chartres, which will emphasize the support provided to entrepreneurs in developing their companies. Lastly, Greentech will offer an immersive experience involving a 3D screen technology for the development of sustainable ingredients. “As the organizers, we are also committed to getting the LEAD label certification attributed to sustainable events”, says the Director. Also, Artificial Intelligence and other digital technologies (Blockchain, RFID, additive manufacturing...) will be introduced in the Deeptech area, through practical demonstrations of their industrial applications. “We will reproduce a value chain live, so visitors can follow the product, check how it is controlled, identified, and eventually sold to customers. Each partner will showcase a technology at different phases”, explains Franckie Béchereau. As far as trends are concerned, two new zones were created this year. The first will be dedicated to perfumes – the Centdegrés agency will offer a global approach to the market –, the other to K Beauty, with South-Korean brand Elroel. As a complement to the show’s business meeting objective, various events will take place during the week of October 16-22, with industrial and cultural visits related to research, innovation, and distribution. These will include a tour to a vertical farm in Tarascon, in the south of France, a Retail Tour, a symposium on sustainable development organized by the Canadian Cosmetic Cluster, and of course, the Gala night, the key networking event of the week. This year’s show should be inaugurated by the French Ministers of Ecological Transition and Industry, Mr Béchu and Mr Lescure. So far, with 250 exhibitors, the companies’ participation has been the most significant since the event was created. “There is a resolute return of global companies, after the Covid pandemic, in particular Chinese ones, but also new delegations, such as a Belgian group, and Canadians and Iranians as visitors. We are actually expecting 4,500 visitors this year”, says Franckie Béchereau. These dynamics will be further highlighted with the 2024 show announcement: Cosmetic 360 will celebrate its 10th anniversary next year. “We will announce special operations to achieve a strong global reach”, promises the Director."
Rouge Opéra: A demonstration of make-up excellence by Le Rouge Français,"The ambitious concept set up by Élodie Carpentier and husband Salem Ghezaili in 2018, continues to disrupt up the make-up industry. Born from the will to preserve the sensorial properties of conventional lipsticks without giving up on the naturalness consumers want, Le Rouge Français was first known for their vegan formulas, made from 100% ingredients of natural origin. The brand is now signing a collaboration with the Paris National Opera, for an exceptional makeup collection called Rouge Opéra. By combining its quest for environmental commitment and the demands of creativity, tradition, elegance and modernity of the Paris National Opera, Le Rouge Français demonstrates its ability to compete with the most iconic conventional brands, through the creation of deep and vibrant colours, from natural pigments such as indigo, sorghum, madder, Damascus rose and chestnut. All of them housed in luxurious cases adorned with the seal of the Paris National Opera. The Rouge Opéra collection includes seven products: Rouge Opéra Lipstick in an “Apple Leather” case (EUR 89), Rouge Opéra Lipstick (EUR 49), Cassiopée Black Mascara (EUR 42), Nefertiti Cheek & Lips (EUR 32), Catenella Red Nail Polish (EUR 32), Rouge Athena Lip Oil (EUR 28), Achille Care Balm (EUR 32). To celebrate this collaboration, a short film featuring prima ballet dancer Amandine Albisson was filmed in the heart of the majestic settings of the Palais Garnier, in Paris, France."
Anne Camilli’s Musée à la Carte brings the luxury industry’s treasures to life,"Anne Camilli is passionate! Trained as an interpreter/translator, her professional experience began with a perfume raw materials trading company, followed by 18 years with the designer Serge Mansau. ""I discovered the world of perfume and beauty, along with the beautiful objects, associated with these products throughout history,"" explains the founder of Musée À la Carte®, an Agency dedicated to promoting the cultural heritage of brands and the luxury industry. In 2007, to mark the fortieth anniversary of the Cosmoprof trade show in Bologna, she was called on to coordinate the creation of a book, Bellezza, dedicated to the history of beauty objects and it was to be the start of a new life for Anne Camilli! Following on from this, she coordinated the publication of Lèvres de luxe, a book on the history of lipstick by Jean-Marie Martin-Hattemberg, an expert in art objects. At the initiative of the French Consulate, the book was transformed into an exhibition in Hong Kong. ""Then I was asked to broaden my approach to arts and crafts, and I took on one project after another. The challenge was always to stage high-quality exhibitions, often in record time. It became my trademark and what gave me the idea of Musée À la Carte® concept,"" explains Anne Camilli. Altogether, nearly thirty exhibitions and almost as many books and catalogues have been created to celebrate the French savoir-faire around the world: from the art of make-up to perfume, from watchmaking to jewellery, from goldwork to lace, from fashion accessories and French leather goods to the department stores of the Roaring Twenties. And Anne Camilli caught herself up in the game! ""Throughout our projects, my husband and I have built up a real collection of heritage objects for Musée À la Carte®, as well as an extensive iconographic collection."" In addition to cultural venues, brands and players in the luxury goods industry are now seeking her expertise to highlight their heritage and history. ""I aim to promote today’s industrial know-how and artistic crafts, drawing on the historical roots of French beauty and elegance. The heritage to explore is so vast that there’s no shortage of subjects! In the archives of many companies, or private collections, we often find beautiful little treasures for marketing departments or designers to exploit. Especially at a time when we’re looking to reconnect with the roots of luxury,"" she points out. Today, Anne Camilli’s Musée À la Carte® delivers tailor-made projects all over the world, to the specifications, budgets and deadlines set by its clients. The agency’s latest project, Séduction & Pouvoir, a major exhibition on the art of dressing up at the court of French sovereigns in the 17th and 18th centuries, at the Musée du Domaine Royal de Marly has just closed its doors. ""We can set up an exhibition in a shopping centre, a museum or an industrial site, create a thematic book, a catalogue or a historical film, devise experiments or workshops for the general public or professionals... We design projects from A to Z, with experts, historians, artists, scenographers, translators... and even cooks if necessary! Our photographic archives and our contacts with numerous museums and collectors allow us to save precious time,"" continues Anne Camilli. It is a work that leads her to constantly discover the wealth of techniques and know-how developed in France and Europe since the Renaissance, and right up to the present day, to create an authentic industry of beauty and elegance. ""The setting up of projects always involves a great deal of research and the support of historians and specialists. It’s great teamwork, and in the end, a job of passion, sharing and transmission...,"" she concludes."
EviDenS de Beauté unveils first standalone counter in Hangzhou China,"Already available in iconic luxury department stores such as Harrods in London, Tsum in Russia and BFF in Thailand, EviDenS de Beauté has selected Hangzhou’s Intime Department Store for opening its first standalone counter in China. A grand opening ceremony was held on September 28 in presence of Sophie K/vella, Global Marketing Director of EviDenS de Beauté, Yan Hongyu, Brand Manager of EviDenS de Beauté, Zhang Yu, Manager of EviDenS de Beauté New Retail Department and executives from Intime Department Store, including Deng Chaojun, Vice President of Intime, Hua Qinling, General Manager of Intime’s Cosmetics Department, and Yu Qin, General Manager of the Wulin Store of Intime. The new counter’s design concept is described as a quest of elegance and sophistication. Paying homage to the brand’s founder, Charles-Edouard Barthes, it fusions brand’s signature gold and ink-blue colour scheme, along with unique totemic carvings on the ceiling, to create an ambiance reminiscent of a palace of fine craftsmanship. Additionally, the new store boasts a meticulous product display, an exclusive skincare area, and a facial device testing zone. To recreate the essence of a brand unique spa and offer an ultimate skincare experience, EviDenS de Beauté brings La Maison, the brand’s flagship beauty parlour in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, to Hangzhou. This secluded spa room, nestled within Intime Department Store, caters to EviDenS de Beauté’s esteemed VIP clientele. In the EviDenS de Beauté spa room, the brand treats customers to a luxurious beauty regimen akin to that of royalty. Before embarking on facial treatments, skincare specialists assess each client’s skin condition and lifestyle habits to tailor a personalized skincare experience. The room’s decor plays a pivotal role in the overall experience, with soft lighting, plush tatami flooring, and a ceiling adorned with subtle bas-relief motif, creating an environment that radiates warmth and comfort. In conjunction with the opening, EviDenS de Beauté also launched a nine-day pop-up store, illuminating the brand’s emblem on an exterior wall and a large electronic screen. The 3D-carved emblem showcases the noble family crest of the brand’s founder, Charles-Edouard Barthes, while beneath it lies a portrayal of the brand’s French elegance in a floral and avian motif, accompanied by the brand philosophy — ""Youth is relative, Love is absolute."" This installation visually reflects EviDenS de Beauté’s noble lineage and commitment to quality. ""Our new boutique and brand spa room serve as essential platforms for direct communication between the brand and consumers, enabling consumers to not only enjoy professional skincare services but also gain a deeper understanding of our products. These spaces also allow us to directly capture consumer feedback, understand their needs and expectations, and thereby enhance products and services,"" said Sophie K/vella, Global Marketing Director EviDenS de Beauté. ""Building upon our existing online presence, EviDenS de Beauté is strategically expanding its offline footprint. We aim to provide Chinese consumers with a comprehensive and unparalleled luxury skincare experience,"" Sophie added."

Candles and home fragrances: Denis & Fils speeds up automation,"Premium Beauty News - At Denis & Fils, you recently made investments to further modernize your production tool. What is at stake? Yannick Salaün - With its 121 years of experience, the company boasts a significant pool of machines aged from 6 months to 30 years old. Our 5,000 m2-plant is divided into six different production halls, so we offer a very large range of home fragrances. This investment is the logical continuation of our innovation strategy, which addresses three main issues. First, we need to satisfy our customers’ requests on time: speed has become key for them. Now, we can deliver a few of our permanent references in 24 hours! Secondly, we have been working on making our traditional and technical know-how more durable: for example, our skills cover the whole candle-making process, which includes pouring, pressing and extrusion, so we can offer made-in-France products. Plus, our modernization investments help recruit younger staff, in a region where the unemployment rate is very low. Lastly, we aim to remain competitive and keep offering cutting-edge products, although the market is getting increasingly global and candles are negotiated to the nearest cent... Premium Beauty News - In which equipment have you invested the most? Yannick Salaün - We aimed to make our production faster, more accurate, and more efficient... So, the company massively invested in automation: we actually doubled the number of robots in 12 months. Now, what we need is increase our profitability and efficiency, while remaining flexible enough to guarantee a broad product offering. We have a catalogue of more than 2,000 references, so our machines should be as well-adapted as can be. Therefore, we invested in automation to depalletize glass, which now automatically comes on trays, as well as in packaging automation, and in palletization, thanks to “cobots”, i.e. collaborative robots fitted with sensors. These devices make it possible for operators to safely work around the machine: the tiniest shock makes the robot disengage. This way, arduous, tiring gestures are reduced. Automation also comes with “semi-automation”. The luxury segment, to which our Denis Private Label  entity is dedicated, requires a unique treatment: we can now allocate a single, perfectly adapted line to the fragile containers that need particular attention, so a few tasks are carried out manually, with the greatest care. Premium Beauty News - To what extent are your decisions guided by your CSR policy and the energy crisis? Yannick Salaün - Before the current crisis, our CSR policy was already at the core of our strategy. And it also represented a major challenge for our customers. It is conveyed by our constant search for new, more sustainable materials in relation to sourcing and environmental impact, during transformation, transport... We had already started to radically reduce our use of plastic-based products, which were replaced with cardboard packaging and FSC-certified cases. As for waste management, raw materials are recycled: aluminium (in particular in buckets), cardboard, glass, and paraffin. The energy crisis definitely sped up our action: there is no doubt our trade is energy-intensive, including when heating or transporting paraffin. So, we aim to considerably reduce our energy consumption and carbon footprint, which is why we have had an in-house life cycle assessment tool since 2018. 
Ultimately, as regards formulation, the share of vegetable wax in poured candles has increased a lot. We have offered an alternative to paraffin since 2012, when we launched the first candle made from plant-based wax! During the crisis, the price of paraffin doubled, and we cannot just systematically pass on price increases to our customers... Also, we have been looking for new bases to best meet our prestigious customers’ requirements. This dense programme will go on until 2026, since we have planned to rethink the whole site to comply with the French ICPE standard on installations classified as environmentally friendly. On the occasion of the next Fragrance Innovation Summit, Denis & Fils will present its solutions for combining luxury and performance in the creation of home fragrances. Detailed programme and registration: www.fragranceinnovation.com."
"Luxury: After Kering, Richemont also creates a perfume and beauty division","The move comes on the heels of a similar announcement by Kering in February, who appointed ex-Estée Lauder Raffaella Cornaggia as Chief Executive Officer of Kering Beauté, before the acquisition of heritage fragrance brand Creed in June. In 2022, Italy’s Dolce & Gabbana announced the internalisation of its beauty activities in 2022 through Dolce & Gabbana Beauty, as well as a partnership with Intercos for the production of fragrances and cosmetic products. Effective 1 September 2023, Richemont has appointed ex-Firmenich Boet Brinkgreve as CEO of the new division — named Laboratoire de Haute Parfumerie et Beauté. He reports to Johann Rupert, Chairman of Richemont SA. “Boet will establish and lead our new Laboratoire de Haute Parfumerie et Beauté to enable our six Maisons already involved in fragrance to reach critical mass in this highly competitive field, where scale is crucial. In partnership with the Maisons, and while respecting their unique high-end positioning, the platform will leverage resources across our Maisons to help develop the most refined creations and promising licenses,” said Johann Rupert in a statement. Mr Brinkgreve’s thirty-year career has been primarily in the chemicals, fragrances and flavour industries spanning the US, China and Europe. He joins Richemont from dsm-firmenich where he held a number of senior executive positions from 2007 till 2023, his latest role being President of Ingredients division & Group Procurement and a member of the dsm-firmenich’s Executive Committee. Prior to that, he worked for DuPont in business development roles from 2003 till 2007, and beforehand as an entrepreneur founded several start-ups. A Dutch-born Swiss national, Boet Brinkgreve graduated from the University of Eindhoven/HTS Den Bosch, Netherlands, in Mechanical Engineering (1993) and holds a Masters’ degree in Business Administration from Insead, France (2012). Following this announcement, the Interparfums stock had rough time at the Paris stock exchange, with concerned from investors about a possible end of the licenses granted by the Swiss group to its French partner in perfumes. The Montblanc and Van Cleef & Arpels licenses represented 29% of Interparfums’ 2022 sales. In February 2022, however, Interparfums announced the renewal of its license with Montblanc until 2030."
Coco & Eve boosts R&D and broadens presence in Europe,"Inspired by the wellness and hair care culture of the island of Bali, Australian entrepreneur Emily Hamilton created Coco & Eve in 2018. Initially focused on hair care, the brand now puts forward the multiple botanical ingredients found in Indonesia and the tropics. “The first – and now cult – product, our Like a Virgin mask, resulted in 1.5 million units sold. It gave its name to the whole range. Based on natural ingredients, including a fig extract and coconut oil, we created a clean, short formula to restructure the hair fibre. So, the category that launched the brand was hair care: it now represents 50% of our turnover and portfolio”, explains Nassim Belhaq, Director of Innovation of Coco & Eve. Today, the brand boasts about thirty, mainly hair care and self-tanning references, but there are also sunscreens, and face care products will soon be launched as well: the first range is expected this September. If it was always particularly active online, including on social media, the brand gradually opened to retail. By the end of the year, it will count over 2,500 physical points of sale around the world. Just like Australian brand Sand & Sky, Coco & Eve is part of the Supernova group, also founded in 2013 by Emily Hamilton and husband Alex Ostrowski. It has a team of 150 employees at the Singapore headquarters, but the production team is European – mostly Italian –, although sun products are made in Australia. Boasting a 240% growth since 2021 and a soaring turnover which has doubled every year, over the past three years, Coco & Eve is booming. “Several factors can explain why we were able to appeal to the typology of consumers we wanted to target, i.e. the Gen Z and Late Millennials, who are very fond of social media: naturalness, the brand’s aestheticism, with a visual identity easily identified on social media, and the formulation history, focused on the efficacy of ingredients derived from South-East Asia botanicals. It is the convergence of all these key elements that made us successful. Plus, recently, we refocused our strategy on science, to get even better results than in the past two years”, explains Nassim Belhaq. Over the past two years, 300% of additional resources were allocated to innovation, so that the brand launched more than ten new products in 2023, including a sun care range composed of four high-performing SPF products, and about 20 launches are scheduled for 2024. This way, it puts an emphasis on new actives with high, proven dermatological efficacy. “While we kept a formulation basis inspired from botanical ingredients to preserve the brand’s initial signature, for our latest launches, we also worked on a different positioning to instil more science to our actives and make them more technical, for example by using biotechnologies”, says the Director of Innovation. “Our product development strategy is based on categories. For hair care, we aim to push forward our expertise and achieve more targeted benefits, because treatment is a growth driver in this segment. We will also keep investing in sun care to enhance our self-tanning expertise. And as for skincare, we would like to gain ground by investing in biotech and green tech. Basically, what we are trying to do is make more premium, more ecodesigned formulas”, he adds. The brand is distributed in about 40 countries around the world, mainly in North America and Australia. These markets account for 75% of its turnover. But it is also present in South-East Asia – Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand... Now, it is developing on the European selective network: first, in the United Kingdom, but also in France, Italy, Switzerland, and Germany, where it aims to strongly increase its turnover."
Technature to invest 3 million euros in new production tools,"Founded in 1996 near Brest, in Brittany, west of France, the SME has emerged as one of the world’s leading manufacturers of powder masks for the beauty industry. The company, which forecasts an increase of 17 and 20% in its sales this year, anticipates another growth of 40% for the next financial year. To support this expansion, Technature has announced that it is investing 3 million euros to equip its two sites in Relecq-Kerhuon and Dirinon, in France, with a dozen of new machines. With a turnover of 22 million euros, half of which is generated internationally, Technature has been able to develop unique know-how and recognized technological expertise, particularly in the sector of peel-off masks, which the SME custom designs and manufactures for beauty brands around the world. The new investments will make it possible to increase the production and innovation capacity of the company to meet the growing demand of its customers. ""This period of investment and planned growth is further proof of Technature’s commitment to providing superior cosmetic products in line with market trends and consumer preferences,"" the company said in a statement. Innovation is at the heart of Technature’s strategy, which currently employs 19 people in its research and development department, out of a total of 160 staffs. The company relies in particular on the production of hydrogel masks and patches, a unique technology in Europe that allows it to stand out on the market. As part of its international expansion, Technature, which already markets its products in Europe, North and South America, Asia and the Middle East, also plans to enter the African market, where it currently has little presence."
Coty bets on mass perfumery to expand in Brazil,"Coty already markets in Brazil its portfolio of international brands, which covers all beauty categories such as make-up, fragrances, hair and body care, but also a series of national brands including Monange, Risqué, Bozzano, Paixão and Cenoura & Bronze. Aiming to strengthen its market share in the country, the company will now offer Brazilian consumers a selection of its lines of perfumes intended to be marketed at attractive prices in mass retail channels. ""Brazil is a giant consumer market for mass perfumes and entering the segment is a strong opportunity for us"", explained Nicolas Fischer, president of Coty Brasil and Coty LatAm. According to 2021 data from Euromonitor, Brazil is indeed the world’s second largest perfume market and the world’s leading market for mass-market perfumery, a segment that accounts for 94% of the entire perfume category in the country, i.e. a turnover of approximately 8 billion Brazilian reals in retail prices. “This figure should continue to grow,” said the executive. According to Nicolas Fischer, the strong growth potential of mass perfumery in Brazil is due to still limited distribution. “We intend to fill this gap, in particular by introducing our products in pharmacies and specialized stores, which lack this type of offer on their shelves. We not only want to enter a new segment, but also act in this market in a different way than what has been done so far.” Popular stores and e-commerce are also part of Coty’s strategy. “Exploring these channels is an opportunity to maximize the availability of our products,” said the manager. With the aim to select the fragrances that will be part of the portfolio to be introduced in the country, Coty carried out a study of the olfactory preferences of Brazilian consumers. “We worked hard to understand the preferences of Brazilians and define the product mix according to their tastes. We have decided to highlight floral, woody, aromatic and oriental fragrances,” highlighted Nicolas Fischer. Five brands were selected for this operation. “Our David Beckham, Gabriela Sabatini and Katy Perry line of fragrances are likely to resonate with their respective fans. Adidas also has the potential to appeal to sports fans. Good Kind Pure is more focused on Generation Z,” added Fischer. All these fragrances include male and female versions and will be available in Brazil in different sizes, for an initial launch of 15 new references. Beyond the consolidation of its presence in the consumer segment, Coty will of course continue the development in Brazil of its premium perfume brands such as Chloé, Gucci, Burberry, Calvin Klein and Boss. ""Mass perfumes were the missing piece of our portfolio in Brazil and we are very excited to enter this new segment"", concluded Nicolas Fischer."
Beauty brands creation platform Blanka raises USD2 million seed round,"Blanka has closed an oversubscribed USD 2 million seed funding round led by Dundee Venture Capital, with participation from Storytime Capital, Disruption Ventures and other notable investors including Fatima Yusuf, former executive at Shopify, and Manica Blain, a consumer-focused investor and Founder of Top Knot Ventures. Founded in 2021 by Kaylee Astle, Doug Long, and Adam Chuntz, the North American private label beauty and wellness platform aims to power and accelerate the disruption of the beauty and wellness industry by doing away with high manufacturing minimums, long production lead times, and analogue order forms. The company promises that new beauty brands can debut on the market in under an hour, with just a few clicks and for less than USD 200. “The industry has seen a fundamental shift in the last decade, from being owned by a few global players towards a more diverse set of direct-to-consumer brands. Independent brands have now captured more than 25% of the global beauty industry,” says Kaylee Astle, Co-founder and CEO of Blanka, who experienced the challenges of trying to launch her own beauty brand. “This has created a wave of entrepreneurs, content creators and beauty professionals all hungry to enter the market with their own brand, but there hasn’t been anything to support them - until now.” Available to anyone with an idea, Blanka’s platform is a one-stop-shop, from product procurement, to personalization, all the way to fulfillment. Supporting both established and nascent brands, Blanka sources and customizes North American-made beauty and wellness products. “The beauty industry continues to evolve, but one thing that has remained constant is the market’s exponential growth over the years, even amidst economic cycles. The success of this fundraising round, especially in this market, underscores that the beauty industry is bulletproof,” said Glenn Baptiste, former L’Oréal executive and advisor to Blanka. “Blanka’s platform will unlock faster innovation for brands at all sizes. I’m excited about what’s to come - for both Blanka and what this means for the beauty industry broadly.” Blanka claims to have subscribed thousands of brands within “12 months of steady growth” fueled entirely by organic marketing and strategic integrations with partners like Shopify. The platform curates a large selection of North American-made vegan and cruelty-free beauty products — including lipsticks, skincare, brow kits, and more — that can be customized with the brand’s logo. Blanka handles branding, fulfillment and shipping to offer an immediate solution that comes with zero minimums. “Kaylee’s experience in and around launching brands has uniquely positioned their team to develop a platform that is demonstrating impressive and sustained growth,” said Neil Grunberg, Managing Partner at Storytime Capital. “As we learned more about the business, it was clear that Blanka was a great fit to Storytime’s thesis of supporting early-stage companies that can have a massive impact on the future of work.” “The beauty industry may be massive and well-established, but it is still shockingly disjointed and inefficient. Blanka is paving the way for the future of the industry,” explains Catherine Williams, Partner at Dundee Venture Capital. “By dramatically reducing the barrier to entry for independent brands, Blanka is set to transform the landscape for consumers. We are really excited to be a part of that journey.”"
Lush taps into the Barbie craze with a limited-edition collection,"The Barbie x Lush collection offers a complete range of personal and beauty care products in the doll’s quintessential pink hue. “We imagined what Barbie’s self-care routine would look like and created this range, meant to be used and loved by all. The collection is for everyone who wants to embrace the power of the colour pink,” explained Melody Morton, Creative Concepts Director at Lush Cosmetics. The Barbie x Lush collection is available on the Lush app since August 9th and in Lush stores since August 10th. The assortment features ‘naked’ products that don’t require any packaging – from soaps, to bath bombs to bubble bars. Products in packaging are part of the brand’s closed-loop recycling program, Bring It Back, which encourages customers to bring their empties to a local Lush shop for money off their same day purchase, or five empty pots for a free Fresh Face Mask."
Kao Corporation acquires Australian sun care brand Bondi Sands,"Founded in 2012 in Melbourne, Australia, Bondi Sands specializes in self-tanning, suncare, skincare and body products. Named after Australia’s most iconic beach, the brand quickly grew a strong global following by consumers interested in its easy to use products claiming clean and sustainable formulation for a natural looking tan. In addition to their extensive self-tanning assortment, Bondi Sands offers a range of sun and skin care products, including broad-spectrum sunscreens designed to protect the skin from harmful UVA and UVB rays, as well as after-sun products to soothe and nourish the skin post-sun exposure. Bondi Sands suncare products are available in over 32 countries, including Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In Australia, where sun care awareness is extremely high, Bondi Sands has a leading share of the self-tanning market, enabling consumers to achieve a tan without the damaging effects of the sun. “Bondi Sands is an incredible brand and a perfect fit for the Kao Consumer Care Business portfolio,” said Karen Frank, President, Consumer Care Business, Americas and EMEA at Kao Corporation. “The addition of Bondi Sands to our consumer family of brands will greatly advance our mission to be the preeminent leader in the global skin protection business and continue our journey of offering diverse products that promote a ‘Kirei’ lifestyle that is healthy, inclusive and sustainable for all,” she continued. The Kao Group has positioned skincare as one of the key growth drivers in its mid-term management plan. With the acquisition of Bondi Sands, Kao will put an even greater focus on the skin protection category, with the aim to establish a firm position globally in the sunscreen and self-tanning markets. Kao intends to leverage its expertise in UV care and self-tanning technologies to expand Bondi Sands’ global business portfolio and further accelerate its business growth. “The integration of Kao’s renowned scientific and technological resources into our operations is an unparalleled opportunity that will significantly contribute to the exponential growth of our brand, empowering us to further expand our product offerings and advance our research and development initiatives. With this partnership, we can now confidently explore untapped markets, reach more customers around the world and continue to fulfill our company mission,” said Shaun Wilson, Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer of Bondi Sands. The acquisition is subject to normal regulatory review and approval. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed but Australian business media Financial Review estimated the deal was worth 450 million Australian dollars."
Cosmoprof North America achieves 20% increase in attendance over last year,"Attendance at Cosmoprof North America grew by 20% this year compared to 2022, when the main beauty event in the region registered about 32,000 visitors. The event had an unprecedented number of US and international retailers, buyers, distributors, and brands such as Walmart, Nordstrom, Costco, Neiman Marcus, Macy’s, Target, The Detox Market, Belk, Thirteen Lune, Sally Beauty, Unilever, Estée Companies, E.L.F. Beauty, Too Faced, Revlon, L’Oréal.

Other curated areas were Discover Beauty, Discover Beauty Spotlights, Discover Black-Owned Beauty, Discover Green, and The Beauty Vanities. “This year’s Cosmoprof was the busiest we have been in many years.

"S’Young International, a new Chinese cosmetic giant?","“In the past, S’Young Group was more driven by the dual business of operating self-owned brands and helping foreign brands to better distribute in China”, says Juliette Duveau, the co-founder of consulting agency The Chinese Pulse. But the group founded in 2018 is no longer content with its role of distribution partner in China. Last year, S’Young purchased French brands Pier Augé and EviDenS de Beauté. “We can foresee that S’Young will integrate the international channels and R&D techniques of these two French brands, paving the way to the international market for its other self-owned brands in the future”, she adds. These equity acquisitions of foreign brands also contribute to upgrading the group’s image, from Middle-Low end to more high-end. S’Young’s own brands – such as Yunifang (御泥坊), which has over 10M followers on Tmall – mainly target the Chinese mass market with a huge customer base, especially in lower tier cities. Through the acquisition of foreign brands, the Group could reach more affluent customers in higher tier cities and might develop higher-end products to go global. Last year, S’Young also acquired the Chinese brand Dermdoc (戴摩道克) specialized in skin repair from the group Hangzhou Songyang. Analysts noted it made S’Young enter the territory of Winona (薇诺娜), Chinese group Bethany’s brand positioned on sensitive skin treatment, which ranked in the Top 10 of national brands at the recent June shopping festival on several e-commerce platforms. “Since 2017, the growth rate of China’s sensitive skincare market has been higher than the overall skincare market’s, and it has strengthened, especially after the epidemic”, observes Juliette Duveau. According to the 2022 Chinese Sensitive Skin Market Trend report, issued by Taobao and T-mall, around 45% of the Chinese population have a sensitive skin, and most of them are women in their twenties living in tier 2 and tier 3 cities. In this field, consumers mainly expect products focused on skin barrier enhancement, skin redness repair, and anti-inflammation. S’Young also introduces itself as the pioneer of the “CP (Chinese Partner) model”, which consists in helping global brands grow and adapt to the Chinese market, by providing a comprehensive solution for the brand, product adaptation, sales, and distribution networks (online and offline). This approach is different from the “Tmall partner model” offered by the Chinese platform to global brands used to cross-border trade with China. “While the Tmall partner model only focuses on the digital ecosystem of its own group, S’Young can provide diversified online and offline sales channels (shopping malls, select shops)”, explains Juliette Duveau. Last year, the group actually opened a physical store called Shuiyangtang (水羊堂, “the temple of S’Young”) in Changsha, to offer all its brands and its partners’ on a 300-m2 area. Given the brands that trust S’Young with the CP model (Kiko Milano, Fenty Beauty, Liérac…), the group has positioned itself on a rather premium niche segment. “Niche brands hold a relatively small share of the market and have a relatively low awareness compared to established brands. Competition on China’s beauty market is very fierce. But as Chinese consumers become more sophisticated and pursue personality expression, niche brands with sharp brand identities and values ushered in their opportunities. The continued popularity of niche brands challenges the established or mainstream beauty brands who tend to re-examine their brand image to better meet the needs of the young generation.” Still, S’Young’s many initiatives have not received much praise from the Chinese financial press, which points at the group’s declining profitability (it is listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange) and the need to find growth drivers on the now highly competitive Chinese market. “For now, the group will remain focused on the Chinese market”, says Juliette Duveau. “There is still a long way to go before it actually goes global”."
Hilo: 100% plant-based ecocapsules to customize day creams,"The Hilo adventure started from a simple, dreadful observation: the huge waste of cosmetic products in France. “Almost one woman out of two says they throw products before they are empty, according to an Ifop study conducted for Laboté”, explains co-founder Élise Postil. ""One of the main reasons is that they think these skincare products are not adapted to their skins”, she adds. Passionate as they are about homemade skincare, Élise Postil and Margaux Brunel made their own creams for years, so they were perfectly adapted to their skins’ needs, and at the right moment. In 2020, the two friends joined forces to imagine the brand Hilo. Both had studied communication and marketing, so they contacted French laboratories to take care of the formulation, research and development, and production, and started working hand in hand with their new partners to develop the very first natural, anti-waste, customizable skincare product in the Hilo range. The Hilo customizable day cream combines a neutral base composed of 99.7% natural ingredients and three 100% natural vegetable oils to select from a choice of six: hazelnut, sweet almond, argan, apricot, carrot, and primrose oils. Consumers directly select the oils they need according to their desires, and especially on their skin concerns. They can also carry out a skin diagnosis online and get some guidance. Once the order has been placed, they receive a neutral base with a cream-gel texture that suits all skin types, and three ecocapsules to be poured in the base. The ecocapsule sleeve which contains the oils chosen is made from pullulan, a material derived from tapioca. The refillable jar is 100% recyclable, and so is the refill. “We have two development priorities: increase public attention thanks to the brand’s presence in pop-up stores, at physical events, and hopefully at certain selective retailers’, and complete our offering by developing a full face care routine”, says Élise Postil. “As for the first objective, the brand was at the VivaTech show last June, and it will be in the spotlight at the end of November, at the Showroom No Bad Day, in Lyon, France, as well as on December 15-17, at the event space In Sted, also in Lyon. Our presence is also under negotiation in Parisian venues, and we have been discussing possible agreements with selective beauty companies, but it is much too early to talk about it”, she concludes."
Coty raises growth forecasts and details global strategy in Paris,"Coty, which will celebrate its 120th anniversary next year, detailed its strategy and outlook for European investors on Thursday July 6 in Paris. The event follows the company’s recently announced intention to explore a dual listing on Paris Euronext. It comes only two months after it presented its ambitions for ultra-premium skincare and scenting at an event in Grasse, France. However, the group’s CEO, Sue Nabi, said the project of listing on Paris was still in the “exploratory phase”. At the same time, she also announced the company is significantly increasing its guidance on Q4 FY23 revenue growth to +12-15% on a like-for-like (LFL) basis, up from its previous outlook for +10% growth. Coty now expects FY23 adjusted EBITDA of USD 965-970 million. Coty, which has an extensive portfolio of brands covering ""all price ranges and all beauty categories and trends"", sees significant growth potential in its prestige division (63% of its current sales). “Premium skincare and makeup each account for less than 5% of the group’s sales"", said Sue Nabi. The success of Lancaster in China and the announcement of new innovations for the ultra-premium brand Orveda go in this direction. As far as fragrance are concerned, the strongest category within the prestige division, the group is engaging a “luxification” strategy, with in the launch of the Infiniment Coty Paris collection in 2024. “Designer brands still dominate the market but niche pure players are performing the best,” emphasized Caroline Andreotti, Chief Commercial Officer Prestige. As consumers in the United States and in Europe are increasingly buying fragrances for themselves, rather than for gifting, and as the frequency of purchases is increasing, they are preferring more prestige products. In a recent report, McKinsey forecasted a luxury boom in the beauty industry, saying the premium and ultra-premium beauty segments had the potential to double by 2027, from around USD 20 billion today to around USD 40 billion. Present in 125 countries, Coty also believes that it has significant growth opportunities in several geographical areas. The group wants to rely on its prestige brands to expand in China, a country which represents 12% of the global beauty market but  generates only 4% of Coty’s turnover. Prestige brands will also be instrumental to expand the group’s sales in travel retail, which represent 8% of Coty’s turnover. Geographically speaking, Coty is also focusing on emerging markets (Latin America, Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Africa), in particular through the rationalization and modernization of its solid portfolio of consumer brands such as Covergirl, Rimmel, Bourjois Max Factor or adidas. In Brazil, for example, Coty has powerful local brands (Monange, Risqué, Paixão, Bozzano) and intends to accelerate its growth by increasing its number of points of sale and developing its perfumery offer. “Our differentiated business model stands on an innovative Prestige as well as rejuvenated, focused and increasingly strong Consumer Beauty portfolio, global reach in developed and emerging countries, strategically located centres of R&D excellence, award-winning IP, and leading end-to-end capabilities,” concluded Sue Nabi."
"“We are keeping our 100% digital growth model”, Ning Li, Typology","With one product sold online every 10 seconds and a three-digit annual growth, Typology managed to build itself a comfy place on the French beauty market, in just four years. The DNVB now counts 50 employees and is marketed in the UK, in Germany, and in the US – since late 2022. After the MyFab and Made.com successful experiences in furniture and decoration online selling, Ning Li continued to move forward, by creating Typology as a beauty pure player from the very start. And he is successful again: he claims the company is now the largest online selling skincare brand in France. “We sell more products than Sephora and Yves Rocher in this niche”, he adds. Given the still low online sales penetration on the global cosmetics market, the brand believes it has a huge growth potential and is not considering broadening its distribution network to physical retail. “There will not be any physical stores in the near future. Being online only helps keep our communication and margins under control. The direct-to-consumer model is the best way to create a brand, because we manage the customer experience more easily”, explains Ning Li. It also allows for a more flexible access to the global market. Apart from France, Typology is present in the UK, in Germany, and also in the US, where products have been marketed for six months on specialized websites. “Things are going very fast in the US. It became our second market, after France, in only a few months. We also have projects in other countries, in Asia and Europe”, adds the Director. The skincare-oriented brand counts more than a hundred products focused on different skin concerns, with short, natural, or even organic, high-performance formulas, and high active concentrations. “Our philosophy consists in investing in the products rather than marketing, and I think we have the strictest ingredient blacklist on the market”, claims Ning Li. If manufacturing is carried out in partnership with third-party manufacturers, the R&D laboratory is integrated to the structure and constantly tries to innovate, with about 30 new products per year. Innovation and agility are obviously the brand’s main growth drivers, and Typology never hesitates to explore bold concepts and change directions, if need be. It aims to satisfy its customers’ desire for efficacy. “From this standpoint, our D2C model is an advantage. Since we do not need to pay for distributors, we can offer very high concentrations in actives, most of which are the highest on the market. But the notion of efficacy is subjective, since it depends on each skin. So, we developed a very detailed skin diagnosis to offer targeted product recommendations”, Ning Li explains. Most packs are made from aluminium or glass, so they are recyclable, and plastic – recycled and monomaterial – is reserved for the largest containers. Typology has recently launched a new range of products highly concentrated in CBD to strengthen the skin barrier and reduce inflammation in sensitive skins. Plantes 1007 and Plantes 4006, a night oil combined with six botanical extracts with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties to soothe the skin and soften all types of redness, and a Mask-Salve with Squalane and 240 mg CBD. These fragrance-free, preservative-free, essential-oil-free products are made with 100% of ingredients of natural origin and Cosmos-Natural-certified. Two new sun references will also be launched before summer, as well as an antioxidant capsule collection composed of a mask, a serum-oil, and a day cream. Other developments are expected, in particular in segments close to dermocosmetics, where Typology considers itself absolutely legitimate. “I want Typology to be a beautiful brand with a long-lasting philosophy that is respected in as many countries as possible”, concludes Ning-Li."

Make-up trends: Faber-Castell creates the perfect punk-grunge look,"After having presented an innovative refillable pencil and a collection rich in soft colours inspired by the Protopia concept at Cosmoprof, Faber-Castell Cosmetics refocused on emerging trends at MakeUp in Paris with the new “Soft Grunge” collection. Identified as one of the key trends for 2025, the modern renaissance of the punk-grunge culture is linked to the universal need of expressing one’s personality and values in opposition to social standardization. “People have always felt the need to express their inner beliefs and attitudes. What are my values? What do I want to achieve through my actions? And how do I want to live in what kind of world? Yet it ́s not only about the answers to these questions but moreover about expressing them: through their style, their clothes, the music they listen to and their make-up,” said Faber-Castell Cosmetics. According to the German manufacturer of make-up solutions, the punk-grunge scene era perfectly exemplified this type of self-expression and its modern reinterpretation by younger generations is not surprising. While dark and bold colours for eyes underline the punk-grunge personality, pearly and shimmery effects as well as metallic shades add a modern twist to the overall look. Combined with a lighter lip makeup, the style becomes suitable for everyday life and is catapulted into the present. To facilitate the application of moody and rebellious eye make-up, Faber-Castell Cosmetics has presented an innovative packaging for liquid liners - a double ender with a brush tip on the one side and a slanted one on the other side. In addition, a new member has been added to Faber-Castell Cosmetics’ “The Texture” family - featuring a new vegan and ultra-soft formula in a plastic cosmetics pencil, that can be applied to both lips and eyes."
"After a dazzling success in France, La Rosée goes global","The name La Rosée evokes freshness, nature, hydration and transparency to convey the values of this young French brand which has been growing at an extremely fast pace. Ten years ago, two friends with crossed journeys as pharmacists and entrepreneurs decided to revolutionize the natural cosmetics offering in French pharmacies. “As pharmacists, we thought the offering lacked an affordable brand positioned between dermatology, with the safety and tolerance it requires, and cosmetics as pleasurable products. It also lacked a brand with formulas containing not 85%, but 100% of ingredients of natural origin, which would tell the truth about these compositions, and also use ecodesigned packaging. This concept was new at the time”, says Mahault de Guilbert, co-founder of the brand with Coline Bertrand. The duo first launched five products in 2015 and travelled the French territory in search of interested points of sale. “The first year, we signed with 250 pharmacies, and now we sell our products in 8,000, all in all, which accounts for one out of three in France. We are the first brand to contribute to pharmacies’ growth this year”, adds the co-founder. Right now, the company counts about 100 employees for a turnover of 35 million euros in 2022 – and it is meant to double this year. On average, the 36 references in the current line, which includes skin, face, body, baby, and sun care products, are based on 98% of ingredients of natural origin. A third of them contain 100% and another third contain 99%. “We have not overlooked beautiful textures and nice smells, which make up the sensorial part of cosmetics. We make consumers enter a more virtuous circle without them even realizing it”, adds Mahault de Guilbert. The products are designed and made in France in collaboration with third-party manufacturers. “Free from anything superfluous, our brand focuses on skincare essentials. And the range was tailor made for pharmacies. Almost all our suppliers are in France, and a few are in Europe”, she explains. With an average price of 15 euros, the brand targets a large public and includes the whole family. “We aim to provide a large access to natural, efficient products that offer pleasure. For this price, it is not that easy to make products with such good quality and innovative packaging”, she adds. The baby range launched in 2019 has just been completed with some of the brand’s new launches: toothpaste and cleansing water. The sun range, launched in 2022 with four products, boasts a new reference this year: an oil with an SPF50. “Our sun product sales boomed last year, and yet it was our first year in this category. We were the third or fourth brand on the market. This year, we have been the first brand to contribute to pharmacies’ growth, partly thanks to this range”, says Mahault de Guilbert. A pioneer in packaging ecodesign, La Rosée immediately chose not to use overpackaging. “This choice helped us save 260 tonnes of packaging.” The brand also banks on recycled or plant-based plastic and aims to develop its refillable offering. The refillable lip sticks were launched in September 2022 and new reusable references are scheduled for the post-summer season, in refillable and bulk versions. After a successful launch on the French market, La Rosée aims to gradually export itself over the next few years. The brand already has two subsidiaries in Belgium and Spain, where it is available in 300 pharmacies, in each country. “We also have distributors in Switzerland, Chile, South Korea, China, and we will soon be in Morocco as well. The idea is not to spread ourselves in too many markets, but to gradually build a long-lasting brand with the best distributor in every country”, concludes Mahault de Builbert."
Coty initiates the “luxification” of its business,"Considering the excellent results of its Prestige division, Coty intends to adapt its offer to structural changes in the market, especially with regard to perfumery where more and more consumers opt for longer-lasting and more premium products. ""Against this backdrop, we continue to grow the fragrance category and premiumize our business through our portfolio of icons and leading launches, such as Burberry Hero and Her, Gucci Flora Gorgeous Jasmine and Gorgeous Gardenia, Boss Bottled Parfum and Chloe Atelier des Fleurs,"" said Sue Y. Nabi, Coty’s CEO, commenting on the company’s latest operating results. To go further in this process, Coty announced in May the launch in 2024 of Infiniment Coty Paris, a new collection of high-end fragrances, that will be to this category what the group’s ultra-premium brand Orveda is to skincare. The project was introduced as the “most ambitious and most premium fragrance project to date,” for the company. The collection, for which there are patent pending for both the formulation and the packaging (a first according to Coty), will ultimately include a range of fourteen scents. “Infiniment Coty Paris is a creation that marks a natural progression for the company, fusing beauty, science, and art,” said Sue Y. Nabi, explaining that much more is set to come in the next months. With brands such as Gucci, Chloé, Burberry and Miu-Miu in its portfolio, Coty has all the means that are required to meet the demand of consumers who are trading up and increasing their spending in more premium products, especially in fragrance and makeup. In the third quarter of its 2022-2023 financial year, Coty published revenues growing up 9%, despite its exit from Russia. Over the period, its Prestige division grew by 10% and generated an operating profit of 102.4 million dollars, against 83.8 million dollars the previous year. It now represents 62% of the group’s activity. In particular, the company intends to capitalize on the momentum in its established businesses, coupled with strong savings, to fuel its skincare business the next key pillar in its strategy, again, targeting the top of the segment. ""While we are in the very initial stages of igniting our focus skincare brands, I am encouraged by the positive initial signals we are tracking, whether it is leading social buzz and product reviews for Lancaster Ligne Princière, or step-changes in philosophy’s sales fuelled by its new brand equity and newly launched serum, dose of wisdom,"" noted Sue Y. Nabi. The very recent launch of Orveda’s OmniPotent Concentrate responds to the same logic of exploring the expectations of the upper segment of the market. At the beginning of May, the group, already listed on the New York Stock Exchange, announced it was considering a second listing in Paris, with the aim of strengthening its presence in Europe and attracting new investors."
China seduced by Swiss brand Méthode Physiodermie,"Premium Beauty News - Since Méthode Physiodermie was purchased in late 2016, you have multiplied its turnover by five, and it is now available in more than 1,000 beauty salons and spas in about 20 countries. Could you please tell us about your growth strategy? Alexandre Vacher - Since 2016, the number of countries in which the brand is present has not increased much, as a matter of fact. There must be three or four more, but that is it. And in fact, it is not our main objective. Méthode Physiodermie is a skincare brand with the absolute promise – since it was founded in 1974 by a biologist and naturopath, Doctor Franco Calato – of improving skin’s quality and providing practical answers to skin concerns: signs of ageing, but also acne, rosacea, dermatitis... That is why the brand is only distributed in beauty salons and spas. Méthode Physiodermie consists of expert skincare products potentiated in salons thanks to a technical gesture aimed to enhance results. Plus, anyone who consults a Méthode Physiodermie practitioner gets an accurate skin diagnosis with a customized proposal. That is why our growth strategy mainly relies on our being close to our customers, in particular by opening new subsidiaries. Our subsidiary in France accounts for 25% of our turnover. We also have two in Asia, in Singapore and China. This customer-oriented strategy also makes it easier to train our partners, and that is a priority. We have three specific trainers, only in France. We have been developing an e-learning application to keep improving our customer service and help our partners become better professionals. Premium Beauty News - The Clinical Swiss Organics organic-certified skincare line was launched soon after you came to head the brand. What was your vision? Alexandre Vacher - When I took over Méthode Physiodermie, I gathered the R&D service team to think in depth about consumer expectations over the next ten years. It seemed obvious to us that demand for results, but also for naturalness, would keep increasing, and that there would be no step backward. Starting from there, we designed a full face care range combining naturalness and efficacy. We chose the Cosmos Organic certification by Ecocert Greenlife, the most rigorous standard in Europe, to convey the brand’s philosophy based on research discipline and skincare of excellence. To make our green offering ever-more sophisticated, a few days ago (in early June), we launched a two-phase makeup remover containing bisabolol and an anti-ageing peptide for a “skincare touch”. Contrary to the French, and more generally to Europeans, Chinese customers are less sensitive to natural and organic claims. In Asia, brands focus their communication on results and flagship actives, because these arguments have more impact on these well-informed consumers who know perfectly well which are the latest trendy ingredients and their benefits. Premium Beauty News - China seems to play a key role in your growth strategy. Can you tell us about it? Alexandre Vacher - Méthode Physiodermie is a premium brand which offers efficient, carefully selected actives and a specialized, almost professional communication perfectly in line with the Chinese market’s expectations. This population has an increasingly sensitive skin, so anti-ageing, anti-acne and anti-redness products are very popular. China is a very complex market, which is why we chose to open a subsidiary in Beijing (Laboratoire Sintyl Beijing Cosmetics Co. Ltd). Right now, we have three employees working in particular on promoting Méthode Physiodermie products. In the first semester 2023, the sales achieved in China accounted for 40% of our total turnover. It is true that this country is gaining importance in our company’s growth. Premium Beauty News - How are products distributed in China? Alexandre Vacher - The most popular concept in China – contrary to Europe, where beauty places are more intimate – is medispas. These are huge, multi-storey facilities up to 500, or even 600 square metres, with a humic area composed of a pool, a hammam, and a sauna, an area focused on technologies, an area for manual treatments, and another for retail products, but also a social club to gather with friends, etc. The Chinese population goes to medispas to get expert advice on its skin issues thanks to skin specialists, like beauticians, but also physicians. Premium Beauty News - What about Singapore? Alexandre Vacher - In terms of distribution network, it is more typically European, with a more traditional approach. Our local subsidiary (Laboratoire Sintyl Singapore Pte Ltd) is doing well. It helps reach consumers and promote our products, and it makes the commercial follow-up more efficient. Plus, we are also very present to train our partners. We have been considering opening new subsidiaries in other countries, but it is too early to talk about it."

Multitasking cosmetics expert Jotim invests in a brand new factory,"Premium Beauty News - Jotim has established itself as a benchmark among cosmetics manufacturers in China. Can you introduce us to the company? Ethan Chang - For almost 20 years, Jotim Daily Chemicalhas specialized in ODM and OEM services for all the beauty categories from colour cosmetics to skin care, personal care, hair care and baby care products. We are based in Hangzhou, a major economic hub within China, which has the advantage to be connected to both Ningbo and Shanghai ports. This turned out to be a great advantage in terms of flexibility, agility and delivery time, in particular during the pandemic. Jotim currently employs about 550 staffs, for an annual capacity of some 200 million pieces. Quality has always been our top priority and we can boast a wide array of certifications in this area (ISO 9001, ISO 14000, FDA, ISO 22716 and GMP) but also in CSR and fair trade. And preparing HALA and OTC certification for the new factory. Premium Beauty News - What would you define as Jotim’s main difference in the beauty business? Ethan Chang - In China, there are only a few contract manufacturers that can cover as many categories as Jotim. We can serve brands in a large array of categories, help them to create hybrid products and to expand to new categories. Jotim focuses on five pillars: excellence in quality control; top quality equipment made from the best suppliers around world; digitalized systems for a step to step monitoring of development and manufacturing processes; agility in supply chain; marketing driven innovative ideas and formulations. Furthermore, we have made heavy investments in R&D, with 28 people working in our product innovation department to create about 100 basic new formulas a year, much more if we include shade variations. Premium Beauty News - Jotim is currently building a new production site which should be operational in October 2023. What will be the main characteristics? Ethan Chang - This new 50,000 sqm factory will help us to increase our production capacity to more than 300 million units per year. It will be a highly automatized smart facility with state-of-the-art equipment to increase our efficiency and further upgrade quality management. In addition, within our EcoVadis certification project, we are building 8,000 sqm solar panels on the rooftop, which will help us to reduce our carbon emission by up to 360 tons per year. Premium Beauty News - According to you, what are the main expectations of brands in today’s global beauty market? Ethan Chang - Brands expect their suppliers to provide a stable quality and to react quickly to their demands. In addition, other criteria are growing in importance today as consumers are changing. In particular, brands need innovation driven products, in line with the latest trends, with short time to market and multi-purpose formulations. Our new factory will allow us to better meet the challenges of agility, speed and sustainability. Premium Beauty News - Jotim will be exhibiting at the next edition of MakeUp in Paris on June 14 and 15, 2023, what are your goals? Ethan Chang - We will present our latest innovations in make-up, in hybrid products but also skin care products. In particular, we will put the spotlight on foundations and concealers, which are among our best-selling products. Our goal is also to reconnect with our customers around the world after the pandemic. Beyond MakeUp in Paris, we will therefore participate in Cosmoprof North America in Las Vegas in July, Cosmoprof CBE ASEAN in Bangkok, Thailand, in September, Cosmoprof Asia in Hong Kong in November and Cosmoprof India in Mumbai in December."
The Body Shop: franchises will soon represent 50% of our French outlets,"Premium Beauty News - For some time now, we’ve been seeing the widespread use of refill stations in The Body Shop outlets. Can you tell us more? Hugues Laurençon - All our shops in France are now equipped with refill stations! When the first station was tested in September 2020 in London, I had the clear intuition that we had to do it in France, that consumers were ready and that they would be receptive to this system, which was totally consistent with the values and DNA of the brand. When Anita Roddick founded The Body Shop in 1976, the only option for consumers was refills. It’s almost like going back to basics! Shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and hand wash, twelve formulas are now available on refill. We’ve done a lot of work training our shop teams - who have enthusiastically embraced the project - since, for hygiene purposes, the refill is 100% assisted by the sales staff. It was necessary to get the POS staff involved, and that was very easy: they were immediately convinced! They are the ones who raise consumer awareness daily and guide them towards our refillable aluminium bottles for responsible consumption. Refills not only reduce carbon emissions, but they also cut costs, as they offer a 20% discount on the same product in a plastic bottle. To date, we’ve sold more than 125,000 refill bottles in France! We’ve noticed that the formulas sell better in refills than their counterparts in individual bottles. It’s very encouraging and promising! Premium Beauty News - The roll-out of franchises is one of the big highlights of the year, with the first shop opening in Besançon last March 8. Hugues Laurençon - That’s perfectly right. This first opening was followed by a second one in Vannes on 31 March, then Poitiers on 27 April, Calais on 12 May and then Orléans a few days ago! We aim to open around ten franchised shops by the end of the year - which is looking very good - and around thirty in three years’ time, which would represent around 50% of our outlets in France. Franchising at The Body Shop is a tried and tested model that enables us to serve our customers better. With our sixty-two shops, we couldn’t possibly cover all of France. By teaming up with partners who are well-established locally and who control their catchment area, we can serve new customers in medium-sized towns in France and the Benelux countries. The partners are ready and willing, and the first openings look promising. The Body Shop has been around for forty-seven years and has a long-standing reputation. The weight of years counts and gives credibility to the brand and its products, which have been tested and approved by hundreds of millions of consumers around the world. Premium Beauty News - And what are your ambitions for own shops? Hugues Laurençon - Just because we’re expanding our franchise network doesn’t mean we’re going to neglect our own stores - quite the contrary! Our ambition is to get our products into as many hands as possible and to promote our values which are effectiveness, sensoriality, eco-responsibility and ethical commitment. This is also why we did not hesitate to relocate two of our shops this year to ensure they are in the best possible spots and enjoy the visibility they deserve.  We made this choice for the shops in the Aushopping V2 shopping centres at Villeneuve-d’Ascq on the outskirts of Lille and Vélizy 2 in the Paris region. What’s more, on 17 May we opened our biggest shop since 2015 (Forum des Halles) at Les Quatre Temps shopping centre in La Défense! This boutique is set to become the number one outlet in terms of sales. Premium Beauty News - What’s new in terms of products? Hugues Laurençon - We started reviewing our entire product catalogue nearly three years ago - which represents 900 references - to ensure that they are all certified vegan by the Vegan Society and that all formulas contain at least 85% of ingredients of natural origin. At the same time, we have also worked hard to eliminate over-packaging and packaging wherever possible. For example, our iconic fragrance White Musk, which has been around since 1981, is now sold ""naked"". Finally, to support all these recent initiatives, we have come up with a new brand signature: Changemaking beauty."
MakeUp in Paris takes a fresh look at beauty trends,"For its 2023 edition, MakeUp in Paris will host 150 exhibitors, a 36% increase compared to 2022. About 47 new companies will join the exhibition hall this year, including many North American companies (Allta, A&H Cosmetics, APR, Balance, Crystal Formulations & Packaging, Kirker, OPT Industries) and Asian companies (Beauty Yaurient Cosmetics Accessories, Beukay Cosmetics, Hakuhodo Company, Hwasung Cosmetics, Jotim Daily Chemical, etc.). And among the French suppliers who did not take part in the 2022 event are France Lab Marie Claire Beauty Group, Maprecos, Metapack, Texen and WWP Beauty Europe. In terms of visitors, the organisers expect to welcome more than 4,000 professionals (against 3,580 last year). ""The enthusiasm surrounding this new edition of the show is undeniable: since online registrations began, with constant double-digit growth since March, reflecting the dynamism of our industry,"" explains Aurélie de Boisvilliers, the show’s Marketing & Communications Director. While skincare and make-up categories are hybridizing, with increasingly blurred boundaries, for several years now, MakeUp in Paris has adapted its offer with a growing representation of the skincare offer. ""This year, more than 58% of our exhibitors also propose skincare solutions,"" underlines Aurélie de Boisvilliers. This should meet visitors’ expectations, where demand is also high, with 64% of visitors already registered saying they were looking for make-up and skincare innovations. To illustrate this shift towards skincare, MakeUp in Paris has chosen as its ambassador, Aïmara Coupet, founder of Be+Radiance, a make-up brand enriched with active probiotics and superfood ingredients with, in the words of its founder, a native multi-racial approach meeting the needs of all skin types, whatever their level of pigmentation. As the show’s ambassador, Aïmara Coupet is also a member of the Innovation & Trends (IT) Awards jury, and she will be presenting the awards to the winners at the ceremony on 14 June at 10.30 am. This year’s competition saw an explosion in the number of submissions, with a 46% increase in the number of products presented. In total, the jury assessed 117 submissions and selected 32 finalists (against 21 last year). ""Generally speaking, the innovations presented are indicative of the major trends shaping the future of the beauty industry. This year, they highlight solutions based on sustainability, minimalism, personalisation, sensoriality, the absence of preservatives and water, and inclusiveness,"" explains Aurélie de Boisvilliers. For the second consecutive year, MakeUp in Paris will also propose a pop-up laboratory in partnership with the company Co-Lab-Ora, created by Aurélie Banco. Located in the centre of the cosmetic ingredients zone, it will allow visitors to try their hand at a Good Mood formulation by creating a lip oil or a make-up remover night serum, all in 30 minutes flat! (To check available slots and book your place, click here.) Other workshops will explore the new frontiers of ageing (Adélaïde Lohio, L’Observatoire Beauté), the new forms of well-being (Peclers Paris), the latest colour trends (Merck and Beautystreams), the role of AI in creation (De Baschmakoff), the new generations of peptides (Maprecos), the expectations of Gen Z (Nelly Rodi), and more. The conference programme will also cover the major themes of the moment: the great divide between ultra-shine and ultra-matte (Colorprescription), the latest concepts from Asia (Asia Cosme Lab), the influence of cosmetic surgery on cosmetics (In Trend), the challenges of naturalness (LO Consulting, Eclo Beauty, TrendColour, Faber-Castell Cosmetics), the expectations of buyers (GO Beauty, All Tigers, Cosmetics 27, La Samaritaine), Gen Z and beauty (Kantar), R&D and inclusiveness (Aimara Coupet, Dr Imen Jerbi Azaiez), anhydrous beauty (Re-Sources, Anjac Health & Beauty, NEO by Nature, Opac, MS Beautilab), the regulatory challenges of refillable beauty products (FEBEA). ""The primary request of MakeUp in Paris visitors is to have access to the latest innovations and trends, and this is precisely what we are offering, in the exhibition hall and with the workshops and conferences,"" underlines Aurélie de Boisvilliers. This year again, MakeUp in Paris is reiterating its commitment to CEW Beauty Centres. Visitors will be able to make an appointment with a professional portrait artist on the CEW France stand. After a make-up session (sponsored by Geka, Red of view, Trendcolor and INCA Cosmetici) and for a donation of 35 euros (corresponding to 1 treatment in a CEW socio-aesthetic centre), they will leave the stand with the perfect photo to update their LinkedIn profile. it is strongly recommended to book your place in advance (here). Last but not least, visitors, exhibitors and speakers will be able to take a selfie to activate an AI-controlled facial recognition system and get a personalised photo report of their visit to the show in real-time! ""We’re proud to be using AI to offer our community a unique experience. But beyond these innovations, the exhibition’s fundamentals remain the same: business, proximity, conviviality and efficiency,"" concludes Aurélie de Boisvilliers.

Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna announces a more compact format in 2024,"The 55th edition of Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna, the giant B2B event dedicated to the global cosmetics industry, will take place from Thursday, 21 to Sunday, 24 March 2024. Unlike previous years, all exhibition areas will open simultaneously on Thursday, March 21. Cosmopack, the area dedicated to the supply chain, and Cosmo Perfumery & Cosmetics, which hosts the brands that are sold in retail channels, will run for three days only and will therefore close their doors on Saturday, 23 March, while the Cosmo Hair, Nail and Beauty Salon areas, which are dedicated to products sold in the professional channels (hair salons, beauty salons, spas), will run for four days and close on Sunday, 24 March. With this new calendar, the organizers have taken into consideration the repeated requests, in particular from international exhibitors and visitors, who were less interested in attending the show on Sundays. Italian visitors who are interested in the sectors dedicated to professional channels will still be able to visit the show on this day. “By updating the format of the show, we want to meet the new market needs,” said Gianpiero Calzolari, President of BolognaFiere. “Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna is the global reference event for the entire cosmetics industry, and it is therefore in our interest to monitor the transformations taking place both in Italy and internationally, to continue to support companies and operators from all over the world who have been following Cosmoprof for 55 years as a strategic appointment for their business.” According to Enrico Zannini, General Manager of BolognaFiere Cosmoprof, international stakeholders were not the only ones to ask for an adjustment of the opening dates. “Italian operators and professionals also asked to anticipate business meetings with suppliers and partners on Thursday and Friday,” he said. Furthermore, the organizers also consider that the concurrent opening of all exhibiting areas will facilitate the possibility to interact with the owners and buyers of beauty centres and hair salons interested in new products and private labels. Together with the communication of the new dates, Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna also launched their new advertising campaign for the 2024 and 2025 editions of the entire Cosmoprof network around the world. Dubbed Unfiltered Beauty / Natural Beauty, the new image, created by Heads Collective, refers to the common use of increasingly advanced filters available on smartphones and social media. The diaphragm that separates us from reality, is represented by a coloured plexiglass plate, and photographer Giulio Rustichelli passes through the coloured filter to investigate expressions with simplicity, without hiding anything. A quest for transparency that is more than ever important!"
Scentys perfumes Nuit Blanche event and innovates for more sustainable offering,"To enhance their immersive visit experience, several museums and spaces have chosen to connect the discovery of exhibitions to the sense of smell. A company specialized in the dry air diffusion of perfumes, Scentys immediately accepted this mission. In Argenteuil, west of Paris, the Maison Impressioniste Claude Monet contacted Scentys as part of a stage project to recreate the boat-workshop Monet used to represent the river Seine in several works. Visitors will immerse themselves into this singular place, both outside the boat, with Seine scents, and inside it, where multiple paint fragrances intertwine. In the French Caribbean, on the Martinique island, the Clément rum distillery will offer a “Wheel of scents” space fitted with the dry diffusion technology to encourage visitors to test their sense of smell by guessing the notes composing the brand’s collections. And in the continental southern town of Villeneuve-Minervois, la Maison de la Truffe d’Occitanie will take visitors on an immersive journey to explore the history of truffle over the centuries. Scentys has translated the olfactory notes typical of each truffle variety. The Scentys technology is based on the dry diffusion of perfume encapsulated in beads placed in a refill. If this capsule was initially based on recycled polypropylene, it now comes in a version made of a biosourced material, a polyamide composed of ingredients 100% of natural, mineral, and plant origin. For the development phase, the brand had to take up the challenge of preserving the mechanical properties of the material, while offering the same olfactory outcome and ensuring compatibility with perfumes. The other technical challenge consisted in finding a material compatible with the existing moulds for the injection process. This made-in-France alternative, which is 100% of natural origin, will be available to Scentys’s partner perfume brands."
One World Duty Free to operate Sri Lanka’s first downtown duty free store,"One World Duty Free, and Port City Colombo have signed two agreements to operate Sri Lanka’s first-ever downtown duty-free store. The signature-ceremony was held at the Colombo Port City Economic Commission’s office last week. The two companies said their partnership will bring to life a preeminent global duty-free retail destination in Sri Lanka. According to the partnership agreement, ODF is set to develop and operate a 1,250 square metre duty free store at Port City Colombo, offering a curated mix of international brands spanning Beauty, Wellness, Spirits & Wines and Fashion. ODF’s first retail store outside of Singapore will be nestled within a 7,000 square metre shopping oasis, Port City Duty Free Mall, primely positioned amidst a throng of international prestige hotels and casinos that promise a diverse and affluent customer base of tourists, expatriates, and locals. Construction of the ODF store is slated to commence from mid-2023, with trading planned to kick off by year’s end. “ODF Port City Colombo will offer travellers a purpose-built shopping environment enhanced by the company’s innovative approach to smart retail,” said the Singapore-owned omnichannel retailer in a statement. “In our partners at Port City Colombo, we recognise a level of ambition which is perfectly aligned with One World Duty Free’s game-changing approach to duty-free retail. The opportunity to showcase our credentials on the world stage and contribute to the creation of a landmark destination in Asia is a key milestone in One World Duty Free’s journey of progressive expansion across Asia,” said Keira Zhang, Founder & CEO of One World Duty Free. Anticipating a sustained resurgence in tourist arrivals following the COVID pandemic, Port City Colombo is set to accelerate Sri Lanka’s economic development by creating a new gateway to South Asia through a range of state-of-the-art infrastructure, including commercial and residential buildings, recreational facilities, a financial district, and a modern transportation network. Developed in collaboration with the Government of Sri Lanka, and CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Ltd (CPCC) as a public-private partnership, Port City Colombo is Sri Lanka’s biggest development project funded by foreign direct investment to date. With major investment plans for travel retail, entertainment, and leisure facilities Port City Colombo aims to become a prime tourism and shopping choice “on par with landmark destinations such as Singapore and Dubai.” “In order to make our vision for Port City Colombo a reality, we have sought out best-in-class partners that can bring fresh thinking and innovation. One World Duty Free’s technology-led ethos and commitment to delivering memorable consumer experiences will play a critical role in ensuring we deliver a compelling retail offer to travellers from across the world and thus the Commission’s vision of creating Port City Colombo as a world-class touristic shopping destination,” commented Dr Priyath B. Wickrama, Director General of the Commission and Commission Member of the Colombo Port City Economic Commission."
Lush unveils upscaled Green Hub for increased circularity,"Lush has operated a Green Hub facility since 2015, and recognising the potential of an in house location dedicated to waste management, the brand invested GBP 2.3 million in relocating to and refitting its new 40,000 sq ft premises on the Fleets Corner Business Park, in Poole, Dorset. With a building three times the size of its previous location, the capabilities of the Green Hub for processing and reinventing waste have upscaled and expanded. Key functions of the new Green Hub include: granulating plastic as part of the brand’s closed loop Bring it Back recycling scheme; treating wastewater from their manufacturing and laundry processes; repairing machinery to prevent purchasing new; and donating surplus products and lifestyle items to charities and grassroots groups across the country. Since its early days, Lush — now a staple of the British high street — has pledged its commitment to reducing its environmental impact and ethically sourcing ingredients. But business remains a key driver of its decisions. ""We’re keen environmentalists but we’re not fools. If the customers want this, then we’ll strive to provide this,"" Mark Constantine, CEO and Lush co-founder, said in an interview with AFP. Constantine was among six friends, including his wife Mo, who founded Lush in 1995. Recognisable by the strong fruity smells of its stores with market-like stalls, Lush sells two-thirds of its products ""naked"", without packaging, among them handmade soap bars and henna hair dye blocks. Some products, such as moisturisers and body lotions, are sold in black pots, which customers are encouraged to bring back for recycling. Others, like shower gel, are sold in plastic bottles. ""We are supplying consumers with what they need when they need it. We are then secondarily thinking about the environment,"" Constantine said. ""I don’t believe personally that people are shopping with us primarily for environmental reasons. I believe they want a product that works,"" he added. While Constantine said Lush will continue selling its popular shower gels, there are red lines that they will not cross, like putting pumps on plastic bottles. The metal bits in the pumps would make them hard to recycle, he said. Lush has been praised by independent organisation Ethical Consumer and the Better Goods website for its commitment to non-animal testing. But they have also highlighted issues, such as the use of palm oil, which campaigners blame for deforestation and the destruction of wild animal habitats. Use of synthetic ingredients and lack of ""quantifiable"" environmental targets have also been raised. Lush says it no longer uses palm oil and is searching for alternatives to stop using its derivatives. Ruth Andrade, head of Lush’s regenerative impact team, late last year outlined a climate ""to-do list"", to be implemented before 2030. This includes protecting forests and wildlife, transferring to renewable power and making materials ""regenerative and circular"". The group also wants to reduce it carbon footprint by ""radically"" reducing transport emissions. With 14,500 employees worldwide, an employee trust controls a 10-percent stake in the company, the rest is owned by 8 shareholders only. Lush is also a key local employer in the coastal town of Poole, near Bournemouth. Constantine has had a bittersweet relationship with his home region, which overwhelmingly supported Britain leaving the European Union in the Brexit vote. The group saw its turnover fall slightly, to 408 million pounds, in 2020/2021, the latest results published as last year’s financial closure has been delayed by the integration of a North American affiliated company. Speaking about the company’s declining sales in France and Germany, Constantine says Brexit was more to blame than inflation. Lush has however increased the price of its products in line with inflation, which is stuck above 10 percent in the UK. But Constantine said that even with a cost-of-living crisis that has forced Britons to cut back on other non-essential costs, ""you can at least have a bath"". And Constantine is confident that inflation won’t ""carry out for much longer"", just in time for Christmas and the rollout of a new flagship store."
"Laneige, Amorepacific’s spearhead for global growth","Amorepacific recently launched Laneige, the group’s flagship global skincare brand, in the United Kingdom and the Middle East, following North America. Indeed, Korea’s leading cosmetics manufacturer is continuing its international development strategy, with the aim of further reducing its dependence on the Korean and Chinese markets. In 2022, overseas sales reached KRW 1.5 trillion (approximately EUR 1.05 billion or USD 1.13 billion), accounting for 36% of the group’s overall sales. Since last year, Amorepacific has continued to grow in the North American beauty market with its Laneige, Sulwhasoo and Innisfree brands. Alongside these iconic K-beauty brands, the Korean giant has also acquired Tata Harper, one of the pioneering clean luxury skincare brands in the United States. Amorepacific claims its sales in North America grew 80% in the first quarter of 2023, thanks to strong sales growth in e-commerce channels such as Amazon and branded stores, as well as offline channels including Sephora. “Laneige’s Lip Sleeping Mask and Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Collection, Sulwhasoo’s First Care Activating Serum and Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream, Innisfree’s Daily UV Defense Sunscreen and Green Tea Hyaluronic Acid Collection have become best-selling products among Millennials and Gen Z consumers who are highly engaged in skincare,” said the group in a statement. In addition, Amorepacific partnered with the Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET) through its Sulwhasoo brand in March to expand communication with local customers. In the UK Laneige, which has grown into a leading premium skincare brand with a global presence in 18 countries across Asia, North America, Australia, and Europe, has made offline debuts at luxury beauty retail chain Space NK at the end of April. For the month of May, Amorepacific  operates an exclusive Laneige brand space at two Space NK stores (Kings Cross and Westfield) in central London, while expanding brand awareness locally through content related to brand ambassador Sydney Sweeney. ""Prior to our official launch, Laneige was featured on Cult Beauty, Look Fantastic, and Beauty Bay, e-commerce platforms specializing in beauty in the U.K., and we were able to see the strong interest from local customers,"" said Jinpyo Lee, Chief Strategy Officer at Amorepacific Group. ""As the demand for Korean beauty products in the European market has increased in recent years, our sales in Europe grew by more than 90% year-on-year in Q1 2023. The North American and European markets are a hotbed for global beauty brands. The growth of Amorepacific’s brands in these markets shows that local customers recognize our efforts in investing in natural ingredients and R&D for more than 70 years,"" he added. This month, Laneige also made its first foray into the Middle East, through a partnership with Sephora, the number one beauty retailer in the region. The brand’s flagship products are now available in Sephora stores across the United Arab Emirates and in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain. ""Amorepacific will continue to actively expand customer contact points in various global markets and grow into a global beauty company,"" concluded Jinpyo Lee."
"""EcoBoost offers a 360-degree solution to creative constraints,"" CPL Aromas","Premium Beauty News - What is EcoBoost technology, in a nutshell? Alexandra Paumard - EcoBoost is based on a compact formulation with reduced dosage, which allows the use of intense materials in larger quantities, without compromising intensity. I have been working with EcoBoost since I joined CPL Aromas, which means for about 6 years. This innovation has several advantages, not least of which are the environmental benefits, as it significantly reduces the carbon footprint of a fragrance through lower concentrations, volume and sourcing. Premium Beauty News - Do you often use EcoBoost in your work? Olivier Maurel - I became familiar with this technology upon my arrival at CPL Aromas, 9 years ago. The project, which had been underway for a few years, was starting to become well-known by then. Today, our teams are using it more and more often. EcoBoost technology is proving to be a relevant choice for companies, with the specifications for, becoming increasingly demanding. The technology initially won over mass-market brands because it reduces transport and storage costs and also allows for a smaller quantity of concentrate to be ordered. It is now appealing to a niche market, looking for creativity and high-end products. EcoBoost is also very attractive to image-conscious brands looking for new and innovative eco-friendly solutions. Alexandra Paumard - EcoBoost can also help the industry solve the sourcing problems that it is facing today. Thanks to its reduced dosage, this technology allows less and better sourcing. With no loss of quality or olfactory performance, quite the contrary. A valuable advantage at a time when the price of raw materials has risen. EcoBoost also reduces labelling, as it contains fewer allergens, a plus for brands as consumers are increasingly demanding about product composition. This innovation also offers a solution to stability or colour constraints. EcoBoost also facilitates access to a palette of top-of-the-range materials for customers on a tight budget. Finally, it allows the same formula to be used in different media (perfumes, candles, personal care products), with no need to rework it. A significant economic advantage. In fact, our clients are becoming more and more receptive to the benefits of EcoBoost. Premium Beauty News - Does the reduced EcoBoost concentration mean formulating differently? Olivier Maurel - I wouldn’t say a specific formulation but rather an adaptation to the mechanisms of EcoBoost. After its launch in 2009, each ingredient was tested at different concentrations for five years. A research phase that allowed senior perfumers to pass on to junior perfumers a methodology that was enriched with the arrival of new materials. The major difference in the Ecoboost formulation lies in the choice of ingredients since a low concentration allows using them at very high and unusual levels for greater intensity. The EcoBoost perfumer’s palette includes about 200 ingredients, including some potent materials, like some of the CPL Aromas captives, whereas a classic palette has about 3000. Technically, the emphasis must be on intensity in the head notes and tenacity in the base notes to reach the same level of intensity as a classic fragrance, with a ten times lower dosage. Apart from the intensity requirement, there is no EcoBoost ""signature"", this technology applies to all registers: modern, classic, retro... Premium Beauty News - What about IFRA-regulated ingredients? Olivier Maurel - EcoBoost does not enable the use of materials prohibited by IFRA, but it is possible to use those whose use is limited thanks to a less concentrated formula. Like for example, oakmoss-like naturals, or molecules like certain musks or coumarin. Because it is at least ten times less concentrated, you can use up to ten times more. Thanks to the reduced and compact dosage of Ecoboost, the formula is often less expensive, giving access to a higher quality of naturals or synthetics, to craft richer or more sophisticated accords. Premium Beauty News - What are the criteria to certify that a formula is EcoBoost? Alexandra Paumard - Criteria vary depending on the medium.  For fine fragrances, the juice is tested according to our evaluation protocol. First, on a perfume stripe, then on the skin. Candles follow the same process, first in a cabin, unlit then when lit. The perfume or candle receives the EcoBoost designation once the test protocol is validated. Premium Beauty News - You have also launched EcoBoost+ What is it about? Alexandra Paumard - EcoBoost+ technology is based on the same principle but with 20 times less concentration. Ecoboost+ was launched three years ago and for the moment is mainly of interest to mass-market brands. But in the future, it is likely to be as successful as, with a wide range of customers. Premium Beauty News - Do you think that EcoBoost could eventually replace traditional formulations? Olivier Maurel - I wouldn’t go that far, but EcoBoost does indeed offer a solution to a demanding market.  It is the result of nearly 15 years of expertise to create beautiful fragrances, crafted with noble materials, respecting demanding specifications. I don’t think that there is any real or effective alternative to EcoBoost at the moment. It is a technology that fully responds to the needs of the market. Alexandra Paumard - EcoBoost is also compatible with other CPL Aromas innovations: biodegradable fragrances, aromaspaces, aromafusions, etc. This technology opens up new olfactory horizons, which is stimulating for creators. It also facilitates the creation of eco-labelled fragrances. EcoBoost therefore fully embodies the CPL Aromas philosophy. While, EcoBoost offers a 360-degree solution to creation constraints, which is attractive to brands, consumers still need to be educated on this subject. Highlighting that the sillage or staying power is not so much the result of the concentration of a fragrance as the choice and dosage of certain ingredients. From this angle, the ecological benefits of EcoBoost, to which consumers are increasingly sensitive today, and the nobility of the materials used, must be highlighted."
French hair care company Eugène Perma is strengthening its expertise,"Founded in 1919 by Eugène Sutter in Paris, the Eugène Perma group draws on more than 100 years of hair expertise, particularly in hair coloration and hair care. Bought and led by Didier Martin since 1995, the family business now distributes its activity between mass distribution and professional brands for hair salons. The Eugène Perma Professionnel business unit offers various ranges of hair care products and shampoos with the ranges, Essentiel, Collections Nature et Artist(e), relaunched at the beginning of 2023, and hair colouration with Carmen Rituel. ""Carmen Rituel, which was launched at the end of 2020, demonstrates our expertise in hair colouration in terms of R&D. Its routine, with 95% ingredients of natural origin and enriched with organic plant oils, is formulated with no ammonia, no PPD, no resorcinol and no mineral oils, with exceptional colour results,” states Cécile Martin. This approach in favour of naturalness is also found in the consumer brands with, alongside the emblematic brand Pétrole Hahn, or Eugène Color, the Nat&Nov BIO brand, a pioneer in organic shampoos and hair treatments sold in supermarkets. “Nat&Nove BIO is an organic brand where we worked a lot on sensoriality without ever compromising on performance. It is also a committed brand that supports the French production of organic active ingredients, with vegan formulas as are all our formulas,” adds the manager. For all our product categories, the desire to move towards eco-designed formulas without compromising on customer experience and sensoriality is the group’s leitmotiv. “We follow a tradition of optimal respect for the hair, we feel it is our responsibility, so we carefully select quality ingredients, preferably natural or organic and locally produced where possible. We aim to strengthen our hair expertise by investing in R&D, to develop ever more effective products, with high-quality formulas and sensory textures,” explains Cécile Martin. The group is also working on the sustainability of its packaging, in line with the 2025 regulatory requirements. The packs are recyclable and include up to 50% recycled materials. Already present in 40 different countries, the group’s objective is to double its international development. “We are already carrying out prospecting missions in China, the United States and South Korea. We are also developing some specific products for certain markets, and we are taking into account foreign markets in our numerous relaunches. However, trends are overlapping one another, like the “skinification” of hair products, and with 400 references we manage to cater for all needs,” says Cécile Martin. Apart from aerosols and lightening powders, more than 90% of the group’s hair products are manufactured in the Reims factory, which was inaugurated in 2004 and Ecocert Cosmos certified since 2018. “We have a strong territorial anchorage with an important CSR approach. Of our 200 suppliers, more than 82% are located in France and more than 96% in Europe. We make sure to promote short circuits,” notes the manager. The French group now aims to strengthen its hair expertise in colouration and deep hair care. “Our objective is to invest in modernizing, simplifying and increasing the expertise of our offers”, concludes Cécile Martin."
Soeder taps into the French market through high-end partnerships,"Amour hotels, for instance have opted for the Wermut Negroni scent, a nod from Soeder to the legendary cocktail, packaged in a customized glass bottle with the hotel chain logo. Soeder is also available in concept stores such as Merci, Fleux or Gravity, in Paris, Antic Boutik, in Nice, Babeth, in Annecy, or Alternative, in La Rochelle. As for the Parisian department stores, Le Bon Marché was the first to offer the brand. “Placing the products in cool places was an efficient way to create a positive image and position for the brand in Switzerland. We’re doing the same in France, with Hotel Amour and selected places,” explain Hanna and Johann Olzon-Åkerström, Soeder’s co-founders. While the couple began to produce their first soaps in the kitchen of their home in Zurich, the young brand quickly found an audience. Just two years after its creation, Soeder opened their first soap manufacture in Zurich. “Our goal was to come back to the simplicity of soap, with formulations that are free from synthetic ingredients but with modern and contemporary scents and designs. From the very beginning we wanted to control every production step from A to Z. This was essential to meet our quality and durability requirements,” Hanna and Johann told Premium Beauty News. Soeder offers a range of natural solid and liquid soaps, as well as hand sanitizers, shampoos, conditioners, deodorants, lip balm, hand and face creams, and body and massage oils. All of them are manufactured in the brand’s own factory in the town of Schwerzenbach, near Zurich. The products’ fragrances are exclusively derived from natural essential oils. In terms of sustainability, liquid soaps are sold in reusable and recyclable glass bottles that can be refilled in Soeder stores and at certain retails. Today, Soeder has five own stores in Switzerland, four in Zurich and one in Basel, and is distributed in the country’s department stores and main concept stores (KaDeWe, Globus, Kitchener, Blanche, Ademas). Some products are also distributed in major hotels and have been available to Swiss airline passengers since 2018. This year, Soeder also created Swiss’ First Class Kit, consisting of three products: Repair Face Serum, Restore Face Cream, and Comfort Hand Cream. The brand now strives to strengthen its sales internationally, mainly in Europe, in France, as we said, but also in Germany, Denmark and Sweden. Soeder is also available in the United States and has just made its debut in Dubai. To meet the growing demand, in Soeder will inaugurate in January 2024 its new production site in Zurich Werstatt, in the district of Zurich Altstetten, in the heart of former railway workshops. This new factory will make it possible to double the production capacity, up to 6 million products per year. In line with the brand’s sustainability commitments, the new plant has been designed to be energy positive, thanks to a manufacturing process that creates heat. Therefore, it will be able to release its energy surplus into the city’s grid."
"After two years of renovation, Sothys reopens on Faubourg Saint-Honoré in Paris","When you enter the doors of 128, you find yourself in the space dedicated to the reception of visitors and the sale of the brand’s products, and you are immediately drawn into the world of Sothys, with its white, gold and charcoal grey colours. Everything has been devised to offer visitors a unique experience: a scent bar to choose the fragrance and texture of some products, skincare rituals shown in images on a central screen and two, more intimate areas, for personalised diagnoses with a prescription, or to make-up after a treatment. A lift at the back of the shop takes you to the second floor where the reception lounge and the treatment suites are located. The lounge is a waiting area where you can enjoy an herbal tea from the Sothys gardens, before or after your treatment, to the rhythm of images of nature projected on one of the room’s walls. The treatment area features three large cabins, each with a premium massage table surrounded by a light, enveloping voile curtain to enjoy an immersive relaxing interlude. 128 rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré also houses an international training centre for all the group’s brands (Sothys, Beauty Garden and Bernard Cassière). The training courses given at the ""Sothys Academy"" allow partner practitioners to benefit from all the necessary keys to adopt an active listening approach with their clients, to establish a skin diagnosis and a personalised beauty prescription. ""The opening of the Sothys Academy, which coincided with the reopening of the institute, is a continuation of the implementation of the training, which is a compulsory step for the qualified practitioners wishing to represent the brand. It is an essential stage in the partnership with Sothys and ensures that our standards are as uniform as possible. The Sothys Academy now has several addresses, 128 Faubourg Saint-Honoré in Paris but also Brive-la-Gaillarde,"" explains Christian Mas, Director and son of the founder of Sothys. In March, Sothys introduced the body line of its certified organic cosmetics range to complete its offer, which was until then only dedicated to the face. The brand has also recently launched, in April, a ""sustainable luxury"" range for hotel spas with 100% recycled and recyclable plastic containers for its professional products, along with gorgeous refillable bottles! Finally, in May 2023, a new face care protocol and a body massage for men will be launched, along with a range of grooming products for men created in partnership with Eden Park."
"“We meet a demand for regionalisation”, Thierry Rabu, Meiyume","Premium Beauty News - You became the Head of Meiyume in September 2022. What were your objectives? Thierry Rabu - Meiyume’s strength lies in our being present in the different phases of the product value proposal, thanks to our network of partners and to our five plants located all around the world. Our business covers primary and secondary packaging solutions, filling, formulation, digital retail solutions, etc. So, it was somewhat tricky to define the company. As a result, my mission consisted in refocusing Meiyume on its core business to stimulate our growth, post-Covid. We mainly offer an added value in the form of innovation. Our innovative solutions are not limited to products: they also have to do with the value we provide in points of sale with our digital merchandising concept. It is all based on exceptional agility, thanks to a supply chain which benefits from a network of almost unique, both Asian and regional partners. Premium Beauty News – How was that conveyed in terms of organization? Thierry Rabu - First, we put the company in line with the regional strategic approach. We used to have a centralized decisional process. We have now given regions a real strategic value, and autonomy. The second phase consisted in even more smartly keeping this regional focus as part of a local market intelligence cooperation, so we could identify the right trends on each market. Meanwhile, we aimed to make our support services even more efficient, including Finance, Human Resources, and IT, so we could take advantage of a more advanced and agile backbone. Lastly, we modified the organization of our supply chain, which was also centralized per market category, and adapted it to our regional approach. After the pandemic, most of our clients focused on a more regional approach to supplying, so that we had to meet their demand with a better-adapted method, whether it be in the US, Europe, Asia, or South-East Asia. Premium Beauty News - Can you tell us about the company’s global vision?
 Thierry Rabu - It is still defined as “Empowering Beauty for a Sustainable Future”. CSR prevails in our clients’ demands. We really need to integrate this commitment to all of our company’s functions. We got the Ecovadis Gold label, and we are aiming for the Platinum grade. This new social and environmental focus helped us reshape our approach to both primary & secondary packaging and formulation. We invested in ecodesign for multinationals and independent brands alike. In-house, we strengthened our Regulatory Compliance team as regards formulation. Regarding product development, we systematically try to offer at least one or two ecodesign options. In parallel, we set up workshops focused on three main values: Agility, Creativity & Trust (ACT). Agility represents our ability to adapt to the different markets. Creativity is the very essence of Meiyume, in relation to product and solution innovation, while Trust is crucial for open and transparent exchanges, whether in-house or with our external partners. These notions have already been successfully integrated. Premium Beauty News - Did you have to make any specific adjustments in certain regions? Thierry Rabu  - We completely transformed our approach to certain markets. In Continental China, our approach to the Chinese market used to be focused on export, rather than on the local market. We have been changing this strategy to boost our growth. Although export sourcing in China remains big for us, we can now meet the local demand. In the United States, we have been setting up a new partner entity in the form of an incubation cell. It will support independent and already well-established brands in developing tomorrow’s products more quickly, thanks to our innovation and formulation power, with a partner in a complementary business. Meiyume’s turnover is well-balanced between the different regions. We achieve almost similar revenues in all our four regional divisions, i.e. the US, Europe, the UK, and Asia. Premium Beauty News – How is your business divided? Thierry Rabu - The trading part accounts for almost 60% of our business, while production in our own plants represents about 35%, and activities in points of sale, 5%. Recently, we refocused the last part, putting an emphasis on digital solutions, which helps brands better manage their supplies, and collect data to better optimize and manage sales efficacy in stores. To this aim, we have our own referenced solutions. As for categories, our perfume business is the most important, because it generates the largest growth, ahead of skincare and makeup. Globally, perfumes are still on a roll, but it is a cyclical market. As regards makeup, hybrid products combined with care are really growing, and so are foundations, while the eye segment achieves an acceptable growth rate. However, demand for lip products has not reached its pre-Covid level yet."
"“Co-creation is the future of the cosmetics industry,” Justine Hutteau","Premium Beauty News – Over four years, Respire has become a reference on the French beauty and hygiene market, known for being demanding. How can you explain this success? Justine Hutteau - Respire has always been focused on its community. It quickly gained engagement on social media, in particular on Instagram, on which we have always been regularly present on Respire’s page – it counts more than 200,000 followers – but also on my personal page, now followed by more than 100,000 people. We have interacted with our community since the very beginning, by asking questions on the bathroom products our users would like us to develop, and we offer natural, efficient answers. We soon realized that some people were highly committed: they answered every question and were eager to get involved in product development. That is how La Ruche Respire (for “hive”) was born, to refer to our community of co-creators, which counts 700 people to date. Basically, La Ruche Respire is a private Instagram account on which we ask questions several times a week about perfumes, textures, packaging, colours... But we also meet our community on our premises, so they can test or collect products. Many people contact us because they want to integrate La Ruche Respire. And we are now ready to make it broader! Premium Beauty News – Does this mean this community of co-creators, which has followed you since the brand was created, will gain even more importance? Justine Hutteau – Exactly. We aim to triple the number of members by this summer, by organizing recruiting periods in the months to come. To join La Ruche Respire, the candidates will need to fill in a precise questionnaire and explain their motivations. We want to get a broader panel of testers, more representative of consumers, to meet needs and expectations ever-more accurately. All new references are developed with La Ruche Respire: members give their opinion in all development phases, and then they test the products for about two weeks to fill in a basic questionnaire. Based on their answers, we review the product until we get a very high satisfaction rate. I do believe this approach is the future of the cosmetics industry. Because, with this method, when we launch our products, we know they will meet our customers’ needs! And the very positive feedback on our latest launches confirms this! Premium Beauty News – Was it this process that led you to reformulate your roll-on deodorant? Justine Hutteau - A year and a half ago, we launched a solid deodorant in a cardboard pack whose effect lasted 48 hours. It was a real success when it came out! And we almost never had any negative comment on its efficacy. However, the cardboard pack did not get unanimous support. So, we decided to review it all, working hand in hand with our laboratory. We developed an “anti-bad smell” patented technology to make the new formula composed of 98% of ingredients of natural origin even more efficient than the previous one. The last test carried out by more than 400 testers was very encouraging, since we got a 4.7/5 score! This reference was released in late March, with four new perfumes available: cotton flower (our best-selling scent for the stick), white tea, aloe, and monoi (the last one is a Sephora exclusivity). We are always trying to enhance our product offering, so we also reviewed our two sunscreens (SPF 30 and 50), which have just been launched (April 12) on our website and at our retailers’. When we launched our first sunscreens, in 2019, mineral filters were the best in terms of health and sustainability. Now, they are controversial. That is why we decided to use organic filters in our new formulas. We screened the list of 21 organic filters authorized by the European Cosmetics Regulation and selected the best in terms of efficacy and safety. Premium Beauty News – Are you planning to go global? Justine Hutteau – We have been thinking about a global strategy. Right now, our website is only available in French. So, by the end of the year, we would like to have it translated into several European languages. Next, we also aim to launch the brand in a few European countries, but it is still too early to tell you more."
Robertet sets up natural & greentech startup accelerator,"On the heights of the city of Grasse, on the iconic premises of the old Charabot perfume shop, five young companies selected through an application process will join the Villa Blu accelerator project every six months, for two years, to take part in an intensive support programme. “Villa Blu aims to be a welcoming place for everything that represents innovation in naturalness, in the broad meaning of the term”, says Olivier Maubert, Director of Robertet and President of Villa Blu. “To Robertet, naturalness is not just a source for all our ingredients. We must have a broader impact and reflect on the whole ecosystem.” Each group of five startups-in-residence will be guided by both Robertet and external experts to identify their weaknesses, work on product design, quality, market understanding, company structure, fundraising, etc. “Startups are increasingly innovative, but they do not always get the much-needed support a major company like us can provide. Natural expertise involves a lot of investment, analysis, processes, knowledge… We will provide all this as an acceleration solution”, adds the Director. The young companies targeted come from all over the world. They are both upstream and downstream players on the natural segment, and they focus on product and by-product upgrade. They interact with all business areas, not just perfumes and cosmetics. “Robertet embodies sourcing, extraction, and proposal. We believe that we need to broaden our areas of competence if we want to remain a naturalness leader. The notion of upgrading is crucial. It goes much beyond our sole company”, says Olivier Maubert. Following this first programme, the companies selected will be able to get Robertet’s support for another 18 months, in return for a 7% acquisition of interests – this way, they will get a 100,000-euro financial help. “We do not mean to take control of them. We respect their independence and aim for them to remain this way. We are mainly here to help”, highlights Olivier Maubert. With the Villa Blu project, the group now aims to build up a broader programme mixing local authorities and communities, academic structures, and other partners in the ecosystem. “Naturalness is no longer just the source of our ingredients. It represents a much broader ecosystem. We are launching Villa Blu with much ambition and passion, because society is changing. Thanks to Robertet’s legitimacy, as the company that set up the project, and to our being based in Grasse, Villa Blu could be the starting point to build up a greater community gathering all this new Natural ecosystem!”  concludes the President."
Inuwet rabbit balms and unicorn masks want to conquer the world,"Founded in 2016 by the De Bruyère company, Inuwet is the French “good vibes” cosmetics leader for kids, but also for their mums. Even though the flashy, animal-shaped packs are fun, playful, and childlike, the formulas are reliable, vegan, natural, or even organic, and most products are made in France. “People first buy our products because they are cute, but in the end, they come back and test other references, because the formulas hold their promises when it comes to textures, sensoriality…”, explains founder Marie Puech. The company boasts a two-digit sales growth (+27% in 2022), more than 3,000 points of sale throughout France (pharmacies, department stores, Nocibé, Beauty Success, Passion Beauté, Monoprix, etc.), including about 2,000 pharmacies, and a presence in 15 countries around the world. Inuwet is crafting its offering to assert itself as a key player on its segment. “We are close to kids, which means we are also close to parents. That is why we thought it was key to assert our ‘green beauty’ positioning by offering more and more products mainly with ingredients of natural origin, and most of which are made in France”, explains Marie Puech. “For example, our rabbit-shaped lip balm, our bestseller, suits children as young as three. It is made in France and contains 98% of ingredients of natural origin. We sell almost one million per year”, she adds. All Inuwet products are green-labelled (“no risk”) on the Yuka application, a reference for many French consumers. Skincare, makeup, bath products, but also accessories… Inuwet, a real lifestyle brand, does not only target children. “Indeed! Some of our distributors, including department stores (Bon Marché, Galeries Lafayette, Printemps), already offer ‘mum and daughter’ skincare ranges which include our products, like our biocellulose masks and hand creams”, emphasizes the Director. “I do believe that this service is a long-term trend and that we should jump on this bandwagon, as a brand much popular and praised among kids, and increasingly approved and used by mothers, who buy skincare products in particular”, she adds. Inuwet will officialize the launch of its Inuwet Mini range when they release the mini nail polish line with perfumed water for kids over 3, next June. “With Inuwet Mini, we aim to provide parents with a reference. Inuwet Mini is a kid range free from controversial ingredients and composed of products with gentle, natural formulas”, explains Marie Puech. “Our distributors will also be able to integrate this mini nail polish range to a ‘kid and mamma’ manicure routine.” In stores, in particular in pharmacies, where the brand aims to strengthen its presence, displays highlighting Inuwet Mini will be available to present the real benefits of this kid range. “Also, we have been working on solutions to put forward our main arguments in more standard points of sale”, she explains. Almost 90% of Inuwet’s sales are achieved on the French market: the brand is now firmly established on the French soil, “although it has not matured yet”, says Marie Puech. In addition, it is distributed in Spain, Belgium, and Italy – at Douglas’ – and on a more global level, in about 15 countries. “We aim to reproduce our French model in neighbouring countries, but also to grow through overseas export. To this aim, I recruited new employees, and this year, I started a collaboration with a distributor in Dubai to develop this highly dynamic area,” she says. The brand is present at Printemps, in Qatar, which recently opened (the “grand opening” was on March 8). “Lastly, of course, we have been thinking about going back to the US, where we had really started growing with a nice referencing at Ulta Beauty, before the pandemic”, concludes Marie Puech."
"“Adopt sells a perfume every five seconds”, Frédéric Stoeckel","Premium Beauty News – How would you describe the Adopt Parfums concept? Frédéric Stoeckel – The brand was created in 1986, but it has undergone radical changes over the past ten years. It was founded under the name Réserve Naturelle by a man from the South-Western city of Bordeaux, who opened about 60 stores in France. Then, in 2015, it was purchased by an investment fund which broadened the network to 135 stores and renamed it “Adopt”. When I took the position of President, in January 2019, I stopped opening stores and instead focused on the gem that was part of the concept: “making high-quality perfume affordable to all”. We started working with great perfumers and fine fragrance noses at Firmenich, Symrise, Robertet, Givaudan, etc., and we recruited a Perfume Creation Director, who redesigned all juices to make original, high-quality creations in collaboration with them. We also boast a body care offering, ranges that complement our perfumes, an anti-ageing, oily skin, skin-brightening face care range, a makeup range, and home fragrances. Premium Beauty News – What is the French Fragrance Revolution about, exactly? Frédéric Stoeckel – We suggest a change in how we use perfume, or a complementary use to more expensive perfumes. Our customers can have not only one fragrance, but several interchangeable ones with which they can have fun. A 30-ml bottle costs EUR 10.95. We can call it democratization, as a new alternative which does not exclude great luxury brands. The approach is not based on a flagship product, but on a diverse offering. In our stores, we expose over 90 perfumes organized according to their olfactory families, and our portfolio counts 150 of them. Our model consists in spending all our money on juices. We produce them ourselves, always with the same bottle – a 30-ml tube. And the decoration consists of labels; there is no secondary packaging. We do not use ads a lot, because we express ourselves through our stores. And it works perfectly well, since Adopt sells one perfume every five seconds, somewhere in the world. We sold 6 million bottles in 2022, so we must be one of the perfume leaders in volume in France. The brand grew by 35% last year. Premium Beauty News – Are all products made in France? Frédéric Stoeckel – Right now, they are all made in Bordeaux, but they will soon be produced in the future plant we recently purchased in Château Renard, two hours south of Paris. It is undergoing some works, but we will be able to start bottling our perfumes in May and make the juices in October. In early 2024, the whole production will be taken care of in this plant, so that in Bordeaux, we will focus on shower gel manufacturing. Premium Beauty News – What is your growth strategy in France and abroad? Frédéric Stoeckel – In France, we almost no longer open owned stores. We only do it through franchisees and affiliates. There are 173 now, and there will be 200 by the end of the year. On the global level, we are present in 40 countries, on all continents, through various distribution models, franchises, perfume shops, drugstores, and digital concepts. Premium Beauty News – Can you tell us more about your growth objectives? Frédéric Stoeckel – Right now, we aim to drive the brand’s growth on the global level. Adopt Parfums is a small rising brand in France, but tomorrow, we also want it to be the fastest-growing, globally. We are already present in 40 countries, but we are not planning to stop here. We opened a subsidiary in Spain last January, with two stores, in Barcelona and Madrid. We intend to grow the same business in Spain as in France. In China, we have been developing a digital strategy. We already have several stores in Asia, in South Korea, Vietnam, etc. The US is a more complex market – we should enter it this year. African countries also offer a big potential, and we are actually already present in Nigeria and Cameroon, as well as in the Middle East. Premium Beauty News – What about sustainability? Frédéric Stoeckel – We work a lot on ingredient supply chains. Adopt Parfums already supports efforts to reintroduce iris in France, and to make the vanilla chain sustainable in Madagascar, along with our partners. We also have projects focused on patchouli, ylang ylang, etc. We are also working on reducing our carbon impact, in particular by investing almost 3 million euros in the new plant to improve our energy and water consumption and develop recycling. Lastly, we have implemented a recycling policy based on packaging collection in our stores. The hummingbird is our symbol: it perfectly conveys the brand’s features, in particular three: femininity, flowers, and environmental responsibility."
"""Brazil is a key market for us,"" says Fernanda Calvet, Sisley Paris","Created in 1976, Sisley Brazil is one of the pioneers of the ""green cosmetics"" segment. With products made from plant ingredients and essential oils, the brand has conquered the world and is now present in more than 100 countries, with a resolutely luxury positioning. In Brazil, Sisley’s phytocosmetics  have been available since 2013, but it was only a few years ago that the company decided to invest in its own points of sale in the country, all of them being located in high-end shopping centers. “We started to structure our own retail network as of September 2020, with the opening of a first mini-store, actually a kiosk format at Shopping Cidade Jardim, in São Paulo. Throughout 2021 and 2022, we have continued to expand this channel, with openings in the CJ Shops (São Paulo), Batel (Curitiba) and Iguatemi (Porto Alegre) shopping centers,” says Fernanda Calvet, the brand’s General Manager in Brazil. The last mini-boutique opened its doors at the end of 2022, at Shopping Iguatemi in São Paulo. “In such a store, we offer our customers quick make-up, hair care and skin care protocols that last no more than 15 to 20 minutes. All of this allowing us to present and test the brand’s entire portfolio and to create a direct relationship with consumers,” explains the manager. The Sisley Paris brand is currently present in 78 points of sale in Brazil, managed directly or by partners, both physically and digitally, including its own online sales site. And development projects are underway. “In 2023, the brand will open its first physical store, including an in-cabin service for more complete skin and hair care protocols,” announces Fernanda Calvet. ""The Brazilian market is fundamental for the brand, and we’re investing more and more, year after year, in retail expansion, with both off and online launches, as well as in the structure of the Brazilian subsidiary"", explains the general manager, without revealing the details of the strategy outlined for the future of Sisley in the country. Fernanda Calvet recalls that Brazil is an important country when cosmetics are concerned; it is a source of inspiration and trends, with strong leadership in several categories, such as perfumes and hair products. Moreover, the growth of local consumption in the luxury segment has placed the country in the radar of multinationals. “The luxury cosmetics market in Brazil has proven its strength and solidity and has grown even in the midst of the recent crisis. The search for personalization and exclusivity in the consumer journey, through a unique service experience, is strongly increasing. Consuming luxury brings a sense of belonging and the more exclusive and limited it is, the more it is demanded,” says the manager. Data from the Brazilian Association of Selective Perfumeries (Associação Brasileira das Perfumarias Seletivas - ABPS) prove her right: in Brazil, sales (in value) of imported and luxury cosmetics recorded a 30% growth in 2022 compared to last year. A significant trend for a few years now, and which has not been interrupted by the pandemic. Indeed, with the closure of borders and the scarcity of international travel, some of the consumers who were used to buy cosmetics outside Brazil and in Duty Free shops began to make their purchases inside the country. The rise of the dollar against the Brazilian real also contributed to this change in behaviour."
French premium skincare brand Graine de Pastel seeks added visibility,"When Carole Garcia, a native of Toulouse, created her dermatological laboratory twenty years ago, it all started with woad (Isatis tinctorial), the region’s emblematic plant. Listed in the pharmacopoeia for its dermatological virtues, woad is a plant endemic to the foothills of the Pyrenees, whose oil extracted from the seeds is rich in omegas 3/6/9. To develop its products, the company grows its crops in the southwest of France on 60 hectares of agricultural land, thus ensuring total traceability. ""We have our own extraction processes and have developed patented actives. There are four of them to date and a fifth is in its final development stage,"" emphasizes the founder. "" From the plant to the final product, we use our own extracts. What makes the brand so special is the know-how we have acquired with this plant. I consider myself to be an organic activist, but also a supporter of local agricultural practices that we are reviving after five centuries of oblivion,""  explains Carole Garcia. The “proprietary” actives address the main skin problems, with an anti-ageing active derived from woad proteins, which acts on collagen reactivation for skin regeneration; a complex of woad polyphenols to provide antioxidant benefits; Scalar, an anti-dark spot complex with woad bio-flavonoids to inhibit melanin synthesis; and of course, woad oil, the mainstay of all products for its supply in essential fatty acids. These patented actives are developed exclusively for use in the brand’s products, with most of their formulas organic certified. In addition to the fifty existing references, two new organic serums, incorporating the patents, were added in January, an anti-spot serum and a resurfacing serum. ""People who approach the brand are looking first for efficiency, then for the healthy side of our organic formulas or with a minimum of 95% natural origin, and then for the militant side of the short circuit,"" affirms Carole Garcia. The three own pharmacies based in Paris, Toulouse, and Albi have helped to win over a large community of customers, who are loyal to the brand’s committed values, through advice and support. The website and the brand’s deployment in pharmacies, which began three years ago, add to the brand’s visibility, which it intends to continue to develop. ""We are present in about 200 top pharmacies in France, in which we already have good sales results. But this is not enough, we need to develop our presence in pharmacies. The challenge is to make Graine de Pastel known to achieve growth,"" explains the manager. Asia, in particular China and Taiwan, is one of the priority export markets on which Carole Garcia wishes to concentrate and establish the brand’s presence. ""We are a family-run SME and I did not want to let any investment fund enter into the capital. The idea is not to spread ourselves too thin and lose our soul, but rather to move forward step by step with the trust of our customers,"" she declares. Bolstered by its ultra-loyal community and word of mouth, the brand is relying on its values and the effectiveness of its products to gradually build its network. ""Twenty years ago, we were probably a bit ahead of the game, but today our values are spot on with the trend. Customers are very concerned about what they buy and with us, they know that it’s not a posture, it’s real. Our vision of the future will allow us to continue to accompany women in their desire to make the right choices for their skin, but also for their health and that of the planet,"" concludes Carole Garcia."
CPL Aromas responds to market constraints with EcoBoost technology,"EcoBoost helps significantly reduce the concentration of perfumes, without compromising on power and quality. With low concentrations, intense materials can be used in higher quantity, and therefore offer the same performance as current standards. By using only 10% of a standard quantity, this innovation provides a solution to the increasingly complex issues when it comes to perfume formulation. With lower concentration, volume, and sourcing, the EcoBoost technology reduces the energy needed for manufacturing. This way, CPL Aromas helps lower its perfumes’ carbon footprint and boost brands’ sustainable credibility. The main benefit of this innovation is its low concentration: perfumers can craft high-performance trails with a palette of powerful, renewable ingredients. “If this technology has always been ecofriendly, now it can meet the increasing demand for sustainability”, says Alexandra Paumard, evaluator at CPL Aromas. But EcoBoost has more than one string to its bow. Thanks to condensed formulas, perfume concentrates and volumes are reduced, which minimizes packaging and transport costs. The low concentration also reduces the mass of ingredients and allergens, so the label is also lighter. In addition, with a very low solvent quantity, EcoBoost enhances the solubility, stability, and compatibility of perfumes with their bases. Plus, it solves the increasing challenges related to sourcing. “The industry is facing sourcing issues which compel companies to work with tight flows”, explains Alexandra Paumard. “The EcoBoost technology helps source less and better, without compromising on quality and on the olfactory characteristics of the formulas. That is a valuable point, given the rise of raw material costs.” Ultimately, this innovation offers the advantage of reproducing the same formulas, whatever the form: a fragrance, a candle, or a skincare product. Given its low concentrations, EcoBoost drives companies to rethink their formulation methods. Olivier Maurel, perfumer at CPL Aromas, explains that this technology required some time to adapt, in particular as regards the choice of raw materials. “In the first years, experimentation helped develop a methodology, which was passed on to younger perfumers.” The EcoBoost palette is composed of about 200 ingredients, including powerful CPL captive molecules, so perfumers can craft intense trails. Thanks to this innovation, companies can reintegrate materials whose use is limited by IFRA, “including natural ingredients like oak moss, or molecules such as coumarin, or certain musks”, and still be compliant with current regulations. “Since the quantity used is ten times lower, we can use more, proportionately”, adds Olivier Maurel. Lastly, the EcoBoost technology makes it easier to use expensive, qualitative natural ingredients to which certain customers would not have access with standard formulas. All in all, this innovative approach frees the search for aesthetics from many regulatory or financial burdens. Initially prized by mass consumption brands, EcoBoost now targets customers with various profiles, including in fine perfumery. Its sustainable assets and sophisticated formulas appeal to niche, high-end companies looking for creativity. With EcoBoost, CPL Aromas offers a 360° response to most varied creative specifications. Perfectly adapted to the requirements of an ever-changing market, this promising technology paves the way for new creative opportunities, since it is compatible with the use of innovative captive molecules."
Asia and sustainable innovation were the main highlights of Cosmoprof 2023,"With 2,984 exhibitors (+11% compared to 2022) and more than 250,000 visitors, the 2023 edition of Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna has returned to the level of attendance of 2018 and is approaching the record of 2019, the year before the pandemic, which had recorded more than 265,000 visitors. “Cosmoprof is once again the reference showcase for the industry in the world,"" underlined Gianpiero Calzolari, President of BolognaFiere. The return of operators from China and Taiwan largely contributed to the success of the event, which allowed companies and manufacturers to recover projects and collaborations with markets or suppliers that continue to be a key component of global trade. This was especially true for Cosmopack, the part of the show dedicated to suppliers of beauty brands. “After several years of China being closed due to the pandemic, it was important for us to resume our relationships with international customers,” said Johnney Woo, CEO of Beauty Yaurient, a Chinese manufacturer of beauty applicators and accessories. The company will also participate in Beautyworld Japan in May, then MakeUp in Paris in June and MakeUp in New York in September, and Cosmoprof Asia in Hong Kong next November. At the same time, Beauty Yaurient is innovating with the use of natural materials for its brushes (wood or bio-composites), glue-free assembly techniques and the creation of brushes with removable bamboo handles and ferrules. Taiwan’s Epopack had a similar will to reconnect with international markets. The company presented at Cosmoprof its new PET droppers with NBR bulb, which were unveiled at Luxe Pack Los Angeles last month. For its part, Hangzhou Ebei Industry Co., Ltd. caused a sensation with its Angled Essence Dropper Bottle and its very original design allowing it to tilt on a 45-degree bevel angle for an easier flow of the contents at the end of use. The design has been honoured by a Cosmopack Award. Sino-Italian manufacturer MYC Packaging Innovation also scooped an award for their 100% aluminium mascara, which combines luxury and durability. All components of the Metallica Mascara can be crafted in PIR and PCR aluminium and are recyclable infinitely. Broadly speaking, sustainability was once again one of the key trends at the show, alongside the ability to produce and deliver with agility formulas, packaging and turnkey products that meet latest trends. On the sustainability side, Geka impressed visitors with its post-consumer recycled material (PCR) mascara brush fibres and its new patented decoration technology that does not require additional film or ink. Faber-Castell Cosmetics also set a milestone in terms of environmental friendliness with a rechargeable mechanical cosmetics pencil dubbed Protopia. These are just a few examples and we will come back with more details about the numerous novelties and innovations spotted at the show."
Melvita to rise again as a major organic cosmetics player,"If it is present in 15 countries, Melvita mainly sells in France and Japan. However, on the French market, which accounts for 38% of its turnover, “the flood of clean and natural cosmetics brands makes the offering plethoric and the market even more competitive, which can explain the reduced sales volume of organic cosmetics”, explains Nathaëlle Davoust, who has managed the brand for just over a year as the General Manager. As the number 1 in terms of organic brand awareness on the French market, according to a study conducted by the Bioalaune platform in 2015, Melvita still boasts a few assets. “Thanks to our expertise since 1983, and to our strong popularity, we aim to get one step ahead again and to reconquer our position as a key industry player. To this aim, we have decided to celebrate our 40th anniversary by taking various actions throughout 2023, including unprecedented ones”, says the Manager. The pharmacy and parapharmacies (OTC stores) channel is at the core of Melvita’s strategy to reconquer the French market: the company aims to be present in 1,000 additional pharmacies by 2024. Moreover, the brand deployed a team of hosts in its points of sale to (re)establish a dialogue focused on its strong sustainability values (Ecocert certification, Cosmebio labelling, French manufacturing in the Ardèche region, near Lyon, recyclable packaging choices, sustainable harvesting charter, close relationship with producers), but also on sensoriality and efficacy, two other Melvita assets. Also, the brand is still widely present in specialized organic stores, and it remains an exclusive brand in the Marionnaud selective network. To support the launch of its new range, Nectar de Lumière, for the first time, Melvita will deploy an ad campaign on bus shelters, in nine big French cities, starting from April 2023. Meanwhile, the brand will be showcased in the Parisian metro for seven days, with a poster campaign in five stations (Madeleine, Montparnasse, Opéra, Pont de Neuilly, and La-Motte-Picquet-Grenelle), with a view to reach a very high number of contacts (an estimate of 23 million people). On social media, for its 40th anniversary, the brand imagined a communication approach focused on its loyal customers and its collaborators, who will turn into models specially for the campaign. A brand committed to preserving biodiversity since it was founded, Melvita chose to celebrate its 40th anniversary by supporting WWF France in its efforts to protect the marine biodiversity. The company will contribute to the Saving Sea Turtle programme in Guyana and New Caledonia for a period of three years. This partnership has two main goals: take part in funding sea turtle preservation projects, and raise customer awareness by offering iconic products in limited edition. The Argan Oil, the Argan Bio-Active Cream, and the Intense Organic Rose Extraordinary Water were decorated with illustrations by Lisa Congdon representing a sea turtle in its natural habitat. According to the brand, the appearance of dark spots is the third main concern among global beauty consumers. “That is why we have worked so hard to offer them an organic, efficient answer with our new Nectar de Lumière range, whose flagship active is rainbow seaweed. A cream and a serum are already available, and a two-phase water will be launched next June to complete the range”, explains Didier Thévenin, the brand’s spokesman. The rainbow seaweed extract directly acts on complexion radiance by targeting dark spots to reduce their appearance (-18%, according to a study conducted by the brand). Ultimately, the range does not breach any of the brand’s commitments: the bottle and jar are composed of 40% of recycled glass and 50% of recycled plastic, the packs are made of FSC-certified cardboard, the iridescent seaweed used in the formulas is harvested by hand in Brittany, France, and the serum contains 100% of ingredients of natural origin, and the cream, 99%!"
A breath of fresh air for L.T. Piver perfumes,"The brand was born in the perfume shop À la Reine des Fleurs, founded in 1774. It owes its name to perfumer Louis Toussaint Piver, who in 1813 bought the place where he had started as an apprentice. The brand developed and opened branches abroad as soon as 1817, before becoming a supplier to the Emperor, in 1858. In 1896, Jacques Roucher, director of the Paris Opera, took over the company. As a visionary, he foresaw that the recent use of chemical synthesis would modernize perfumery and surrounded himself with creative chemists. The result was Trèfle Incarnat (1898), one of the great successes of the Belle Époque era. He developed the brand through the growth of advertizing and increased the number of branches on the global level. At the dawn of the 1920s, the French company, whose motto was “L.T. Piver perfumes the world”, was one of the few companies that generated more than half of its turnover abroad. The brand lived through the decades following the war, in particular by relying on the success of its famous hair “lotions” derived from its perfumes. In 1967, the company was awarded the French Legion of Honour decoration for its longevity and the quality of its products. However, like many old brands, it never really returned to its glory days. In 1989, L.T. Piver was bought by the Franco-Algerian Amouyal family from the Rhône-Poulenc chemical group. In June 2022, the brand caught Nelly Chenelat’s attention. After 30 years working in the world of perfume at Cartier, Mugler, or YSL, in various positions, she aspired to a personal, creative project. She discovered L.T. Piver and was immediately seduced by its heritage and creativity, and the excellent value for money of its made in France products. The owner, Éric Amouyal, agreed to sell the brand. To boost the brand’s renewal, Nelly Chenelat has decided to rely on the olfactory richness of fragrances that survived the past few years without any communication support, thus opening up numerous perspectives. L.T. Piver’s flourishing heritage, a source of inspiration and an ideal basis for storytelling, represents another asset, as is its global dimension, since it sells over 2 million units worldwide (in the Caribbean, the United States, the Middle-East, Cambodia, etc.). In addition to all this, the new owner says, L.T. Piver stands out thanks to its quality craftsmanship. By 1860, the brand had three factories in Paris, Aubervilliers, and Grasse. Still in operation, the last one carries out raw material blending, concentrate maturation, alcohol integration, and maceration. As the L.T. Piver perfume company has always sourced its own ingredients, its internal know-how offers a singular olfactory signature, while guaranteeing the confidentiality of formulas. “The notion of blending is essential for the brand, because it involves maturation or maceration times that impact the perfume’s olfactory rendering”, explains Joëlle Lerioux, chosen by Nelly Chenelat as her in-house perfumer. The diversity of the L.T. Piver catalogue is as inspiring as the brand’s craftsmanship. Starting from the beginning of the 20th century, the company developed body and hair soap, scented pastilles, ointments, brillantine, but also hair lotions inspired by its perfumes, Rêve d’Or, Pompeïa and Héliotrope Blanc, which are still available today. “L.T. Piver’s offering is really generous, it is aimed at a wide range of customers, regardless of their purchasing power”, explains Nelly Chenelat. “It’s a beauty and well-being perfumery,” adds Joëlle Lerioux. The objective is to assert and perpetuate the masstige positioning of the current range, while developing new, more “niche” fragrances. Héliotrope Blanc, Cuir de Russie or Rêve d’Or, inexpensive references popular with perfume lovers, will therefore remain more or less at the same price. The new products, however, will have a premium positioning, and new extracts or fragrances will be designed. It is a creative work in its own right, drawing on the brand’s heritage, for which Joëlle Lerioux endeavours to paraphrase the olfactory signature, not to betray its DNA, while preserving its quality. This continuity is based in particular on the brand’s craftsmanship, which was passed on, and on its autonomy. The heritage of this historic house will also help develop a range of skincare products inspired from the old products, with formulas updated to the latest standards and tastes. Through L.T. Piver, Nelly Chenelat and Joëlle Lerioux hope to promote a quality, popular perfumery. An “old-fashioned perfumery which involves taking the time to make something beautiful”. The ongoing projects are expected to come to market next year. They might be previewed at the TFWA 2023, in Cannes."
Freedge Beauty changes name to Les Cosmétiques Frais and raises EUR 1.5 M,"The French expert of ultra-fresh skincare products is gaining momentum! Previously named Freedge Beauty, the brand has changed name to Les Cosmétiques Frais, but the concept remains the same: ultra-fresh, natural and seasonal face and body care products made of squeezed fruits and vegetables, including strawberries, tomatoes, carrots, raspberries and blueberries. ""A French name better exemplifies the values of our brand, which is 100% local with sourcing close to our press located in Clermont-Ferrand in the centre of France,"" says Laurence Casey, co-founder. Freshly B Corp certified, the brand recently raised 1.5 million euros from Crédit Agricole Auvergne, Auvergne Business Angels, the FM Invest fund and independent investors. The funds will make it possible to finance the automation of certain parts of the manufacturing process, the creation of new products, as well as communication actions. The three partners behind the start-up — all of whom have worked for cosmetics giants such as L’Oréal, Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson — have come up with a range of fresh cosmetics made from organic, seasonal fruit and vegetables grown in France as part of a local approach to sourcing. Not content with favouring quality plants, the brand also contributes to developing the local economy. More specifically, the various plants and produce selected for their numerous skin benefits are grown in France, before leaving for the production site, near Clermont-Ferrand, where they are peeled and then cold pressed to preserve a maximum of nutrients. Thanks to a patented process, each of the facial care products is formulated with a high concentration of pressed juices, from 74% for the jellies to 92% for the serums. The final step is shipping. After being packaged in small containers, they arrive at the customer’s home within three days (for customers in France). Once empty, plastic-free packaging can be returned free of charge to the brand, which cleans and sterilizes them before refilling them. Today, the brand is mainly available online, via its website (www.lescosmetiquesfrais.fr) or platforms dedicated to green and ethical products such as Bien ou Bien and Dreamact. “We are also distributed by the La Ruche Qui Dit Oui retail network throughout France. The development of our refrigerated box will help us find the right approach for or fresh beauty concept in brick-and-mortar retails and salons, but for the moment we focus on digital sales,” underlines Laurence Casey. The brand achieved a turnover of 500,000 euros in 2022, more than twice the amount of 2021, and is aiming for one million euros in 2023. “We have around 10,000 subscribers and half of them are regular buyers, with many very loyal customers, some of them having already placed more than 30 orders in two years. The time between two purchases is of 40 days on average, considering that our containers can be used for about of one month”, specifies Laurence Casey. The brand also plans to roll out its concept on various market across the world, starting with the United States. ""The globalisation of the brand will rely on the local duplication of our concept, with the dedicated presses settled on the different targeted markets and local sourcing of fruits and vegetables""."
WPE technology makes perfume love water,"The alcohol-free perfume trend had been brewing for a few years. It is now becoming clearer and clearer, with major launches like Dior’s J’adore Parfum d’Eau. And it is an opportunity for Neovix Biosciences, a specialist in plant-based O/W microemulsions, to highlight its patented WPE (for Water Plant Emulsion) process. “With my partner Christian Sarbach, we have been working for more than ten years on this technology, which had already been used by Hermès for the water-based perfume series Jardin après la Mousson, Jardin sur le Nil, and Jardin en Méditerranée. Now, the trend for natural and alcohol-free products and fragrances has grown, and we have many requests”, says Marc Bonnevay, Director of SCM Cosmétiques - Neovix Biosciences Group. Sabé Masson, with its Soft Perfume Liquide, and Maison Sybarite, with the collection of eaux de parfum, also chose this solution in keeping with a more skin- and environmentally friendly offering. The WPE technology is an innovative process for dispersing the perfumed composition in pure water, without using any alcohol or solvent, but based on a plant-derived ingredient. “It is an oil-in-water dispersion; not solubilization, which is used with alcohol, nor encapsulation. That is what makes our technology different and interesting. The binder is a plant extract in very small quantity: a saponin derived from a variety of tea. Today, our formulations pass accelerated stability tests for one month at 50 degrees”, explains Marc Bonnevay. The billions of micro-droplets in the composition give the juice a milky effect. It is recommended to use opaque packaging to protect the emulsion, and to add Ecocert preservatives. “The same technology is used for skincare products. It all depends on the oil concentration. For a perfumer, it is 5% to 15% of perfumed concentrate, but you can go up to 20%, 30%, or 40% of argan oil, for example, while keeping great fluidity. Therefore, the product moisturizes and perfumes at the same time”, adds the Director. The absence of alcohol directly leads to base and heart notes, producing an olfactory identity that is as close as possible to the perfumer’s creation, as well as reinforced remanence. The fragrance concentrate used with the WPE patent therefore provides a 100% natural, non-irritant perfume. Moisturizing and non-oily, the microfluidic emulsion melts into the skin without any risk of allergy. As a result, the solution suits all skin types, even the most fragile, such as that of children and babies, and has just been chosen for the new range of Toofruit perfumes for children. It can also be applied as a fragrant mist onto hair, without drying it out. “This is a major development. Alcohol-free perfume is a very strong trend, and pump suppliers such as Aptar and Silgan are all working on models designed for microemulsions, because they believe it is the future”, says Marc Bonnevay. Between perfume and skincare, the WPE technology seems to be imposing itself, with new launches planned this year on an alcohol-free perfume market that is still struggling to find its feet. “The Dior Parfum d’Eau effect is beneficial and will set an example. We are still dealing with the constraint of a high industrialization cost, but the more we grow, the easier it will be to lower costs”, concludes Marc Bonnevay."
"UpCircle Beauty, or how to become a key, successful upcycled cosmetics brand","Coffee grounds, at the origin of the concept, kiwi, blueberry, and orange waste from the food industry, unsold items from the London flower market… the committed brand UpCircle now uses twenty upcycled ingredients, sourced from all over the world for their cosmetic products. “Powders, oils, waters… we will continue to diversify the ingredients we work with and demonstrate there are endless possibilities with this kind of raw material supplied in very large quantities by different industries. Our latest launches contain new ingredients that we have never used before, such as rose petals infused in bath salts, or hibiscus flower acids for a hand cream”, says the co-founder. Founded in 2016 by Anna Brightman and her brother William, UpCircle has already developed a range of almost 40 face care, body care, and recently, hair care products based on these types of ingredients. “The brand has grown a lot over the past two years”, confirms Anna Brightman. Distributed in department stores, independent shops and online, UpCircle is present in forty countries, and claims affordable, environmentally friendly performance in several respects. “Above all, products must be effective and offer high performance. We put a lot of effort into innovation. We will not use an upcycled ingredient unless its benefits are clinically and dermatologically proven”, says the founder. In addition, the brand commits to controlling the use of packaging. For its UK customers, UpCircle has set up a package return and refill programme through the postal service. “We mainly use glass and aluminium, which are recyclable in most countries. We have also implemented a package return system. When you finish your product at home, you can buy it back 20% cheaper on the website: you will then receive a label by email for you to send us back the empty jar for free. We clean it, sterilise it, and refill it. You will then receive the product in your packaging after 4 to 5 days. Our packs are 99% plastic-free, and we offer a solution for the remaining 1%, such as pipettes”, explains Anna Brightman. The system is currently in place in the UK and is about to be implemented in other countries. With one product sold every 90 seconds, the brand keeps growing, in particular with the help of a GBP 480,000 (approximately EUR 545,000 or USD 580,000) crowdfunding campaign in 2022. The funds will be used to expand distribution in other markets. “Our biggest markets are the UK and the US, but we are trying to grow in Europe, although it is difficult due to Brexit”, notes Anna Brightman. Investments in communication and marketing and the development of products in new categories are also top priorities. “We have reinvested all of our profits into our business and new product development”, she adds. UpCircle is planning to launch new ranges in the near future: hair products next month, then baby products and make-up. Proof, if any were needed, of the cosmetic validity of by-products from circular supply chains, the British brand’s success is setting a new model to follow."
IL Cosmetics Group sets sail for North America,"""We are now one of the top 3 European make-up manufacturers, and we are posting double-digit growth, thanks to our investments (a new laboratory, a new R&D resources) and expanded capacities in our three European production and filling sites,"" explains Jean-François Harpes, CEO of IL Cosmetics Group. Since the mid-2000s, the Luxembourgish group has been able to diversify its activities to become a world-class color cosmetics manufacturer, with an extensive multi-product portfolio in the nail, eye and lip categories. “Driven by reliability and transparency, we guarantee performances through a deep consumer centricity approach,” adds the manager. Today, IL Cosmetics Group provides beauty brands with turnkey products based on the latest technologies, the latest trends and high quality standards, with strong support at all stages of the project. And the company can boast of great successes! ""We are the manufacturer of one of the best-selling mascaras in the world and one of the biggest and best-selling lipgloss ranges in Europe,"" highlights Aurélie Ignaccolo, Head of Marketing Director at IL Cosmetics. “These worldwide top sellers have become real benchmarks for many brands, including in the United States.” To accelerate its globalization strategy, the group thus intends to rely on the renowned international references that have opted for made-in-Luxembourg make-up. And logically, the United States are the first stop of the journey. IL Cosmetics Group will first open a sales office in the country and, in the medium to long term, the stated objective is to have a production site in North America. In the lips category, IL Cosmetics Group seeks to meet the demand for instant plumping products, which is growing strongly. The group successfully transposed instant plumping from usual lip gloss textures to a semi-matte liquid lipstick format. “At MakeUp in Los Angeles, we have introduced Demi Matt Plumper, an instant lip volumizer liquid lipstick that delivers opaque and intense one-swipe color with a non-dry satin finish. This product has already caught the curiosity of several brands,” says Laura Pereira, Senior Lips Product Manager. In the eyes category, the consumer demand, driven by social media, is oriented towards mascaras that provide make-up results in just a few strokes. “Products need to deliver instant gratification through visible transformations that are ‘TikTok worthy’. Hence the need for products with fast volume like our Volume Maximizer that made a buzz in LA,"" emphasizes Juanita Parra, Marketing Manager Make Up. These innovations will of course also be visible at the next Cosmoprof show in Bologna, Italy, alongside a collection of mascaras that come in recycled packaging, have a bio-based brushes and are paired with performing formulas that have a high percentage of naturality. Of course, IL Cosmetics remains a key player in the nail category, a market now driven by new hybrid technologies inspired by semi-permanent gels and available in retail thanks to new “HEMA-free and DI-HEMA-free” formulations which will be previewed at the Cosmoprof event (stand G13-F14 Hall 15)."
L’Oréal debuts Carol’s Daughter in France before European roll out,"Carol’s Daughter was a forerunner in the market for natural products for textured hair, before other popular brands such as Melanin, Pattern, and Mielle Organics. The brand was born in 1993 in Brooklyn, in the kitchen of its founder Lisa Price, where she started out making fragrances on weekends before focusing her attention toward body care products. Encouraged by her mother Carol and by the success of her first creations sold at the church flea market, she quickly understood that there was a strong demand for effective, non-aggressive natural products suitable for textured hair. ""I was credited with starting the natural movement in haircare, but actually this was due to the fact that I started formulating in my kitchen, so I searched simple things matching with what my customers wanted,"" said Lisa Price during a press conference in Paris last week. Carol’s Daughter experienced rapid development in the early 2000s, before being acquired by L’Oréal in 2014. An operation that sparked backlash from consumers, worrying about the fact the brand would struggle to hold on to the authenticity and DNA. ""In the US, Black people did not have a history of doing things with White-owned companies. We have bad stories of Black entrepreneurs having been stolen by big corporations and I think that’s why the conversation was not good at the time of the acquisition. But now, things are different and we have proven that with L’Oréal, we were able to do things even better for our customers,"" explained Lisa Price. By joining L’Oréal, Carol’s Daughter was able to expand their footprint in the United States and selling their body, skin and hair care products with the main retailers throughout the country, until their entry at Target in 2021. An important issue since, even in the United States, the distribution of products adapted to afro-textured hair and skin is insufficient, showed McKinsey in a recent report [1]. In Europe, things are certainly no better. Even when they manage to find a store that offers products that suit their needs, consumers are often disappointed with the quality or quantity of what’s available. It is to meet these expectations that Carol’s Daughter now takes its first steps on the French market, a few months after its launch in the United Kingdom and before rolling out accross the rest of Europe. Four product ranges - Goddess Strength, Black Vanilla, Coco Creme and Wash Day Delight - covering most of the needs of curly and frizzy hair will be available from March, in 150 specialized sales points and on Amazon, at recommended selling prices ranging from 8 to 15 euros."
"After a pandemic slowdown, Cosmoprof is back in force in Bologna","Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna is back for a 54th edition with growing numbers. The leading B2B event for the beauty industry will be held from 16th to 20th March 2023 in Bologna, Italy. As announced by the organizers during a press conference held in Milan, the show will gather under one roof over 2.900 companies (+11% compared to 2022) from 64 countries. According to BolognaFiere Cosmoprof, the company behind the event, decisive factors of the growing numbers recorded in the March edition are the return of companies from China and Taiwan, that previously were unable to exit their respective countries. 60% of exhibitors are coming from Europe, and the remaining 40% are from other continents. A total of 29 country pavilions will gather small and medium companies from Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, California, China, Czech Republic, Ecuador, France, Germany, Greece, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Japan, Latvia, Poland, Romania, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Turkey, UK, Ukraine, and the USA. Argentina, Australia, India, and Romania were not attending in 2022 and are returning this year. Ireland will attend the exhibition with its National Agency for the first time eve. Pre-registered visitors to the event up to now are coming from 116 countries. Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna expects to attract selected buyers from 50 countries thanks to the support of the Italian Trade Agency (ITA), and its offices across the world. “Delegations of buyers, retailers, and distributors from the most strategic markets, such as North America, Europe, Middle East, Asia, and Oceania will meet Cosmoprof 2023 exhibitors to discover new proposal and industrial solutions. The interaction with the Health & Beauty network, part of BolognaFiere Cosmoprof, will bring to Bologna a delegation of top buyers representing the European professional distribution channel,” said the organizers. To meet business habits and needs of the beauty sector and international stakeholders opening dates of each parts of the show have been revised. For the first time this year, Cosmopack, the area dedicated to the companies of the supply chain, and Cosmo Perfumery & Cosmetics, with the players of the retail channel and of prestige and mass market, will open for three days only, from Thursday to Saturday, since foreign operators prefer to concentrate business meetings in the working days. Cosmo Hair, Nail & Beauty Salon, the areas dedicated to the professional channel, will maintain the traditional 4-day opening, from Friday to Monday, in order to welcome the operators when salons and beauty salons are closed “Up to now data foreshadow a successful edition,” said Enrico Zannini, General Director of BolognaFiere Cosmoprof. “Today attendees are pre-registering from 116 countries in the world. We are recording better results than for the 2019 edition, before the pandemic, and registrations from outside Italy are growing significantly. Compared to 2022 our digital community is much more committed, both on social media and on our website, with a growth up to 15% of engagement rate. These references confirm the recovery of both the fair and beauty sectors. We are ready to host our beauty community in Bologna, to feel again the buzz, the creativity, and the optimism of our industry.”"

"Meiyume, a turnkey solution orchestrator for the cosmetics industry","Thanks to the acquisition, since 2007, of eleven companies with complementary businesses, the Hong Kong-based Meiyume company, the beauty division of the Fung Group, now offers a wide-ranging business model covering formulation, packaging – primary and secondary – and digital retail solutions. Upstream, the “product solutions” unit takes care of development and production, at all stages of the value chain. The R&D laboratory defines the formulation and sourcing, mainly for skincare and makeup, as well as the package design, in a pack developed in-house or suggested by the customer. “We are not just contract packagers, we need to add value to a project”, says François Camilli, Executive Vice President – Meiyume Europe. The company has five factories around the world, in the United States, the United Kingdom, Thailand, Indonesia, and China. They are focused on the skincare, makeup, and fragrance formulation business: the facilities meet mixing, filling and supply requirements for all formulas, whether they are powders, water-based, or alcohol-based. “This way, we can formulate and fill in several locations around the world. It makes it possible to build supply chains according to the brands’ needs and the markets they wish to target. We can also work with partners on a ’make or buy’ basis, so we can have the desired ’Made In’ label on the products, depending on the brands’ requests”, adds François Camilli. Meiyume’s expertise also includes the design and development of primary packaging, as well as the design of promotional products. Production is outsourced to a network of ten exclusive partners mainly based in China. “We are known for our ability to arrange the supply chain for complex multi-material packaging. One of our best examples is the orchestration of eleven factories producing 17 components to deliver a finished product to our customers. The notion of added value is always paramount”, emphasizes the manager. Finally, to support brands from A to Z, the company offers the technological implementation of retail solutions. To help set up traditional POS advertising, Meiyume is now able to collect the feelings and behaviour of consumers at the point of sale via digital technology. “Through data and analysis, we have the technical means to inform our clients of consumers’ reactions to the products when they see them on display, all over the world”, says François Camilli. “This information helps them define their target or product more precisely, if necessary”, he continues. Through its OneHome platform, a suite of applications integrated to POS ads, brands can manage the installing, updating and maintenance process for in-store displays. In addition, connected displays can adapt the interactive experience to the audience. For example, a screen fitted with a facial analysis camera adjusts the video content shown according to the gender of the person facing it. Already widespread in Asia, these digital experiences at the point of sale should soon develop in Europe, according to François Camilli."
"Carita, spearhead of the L’Oréal Luxe Division on the skincare market","As the skincare and wellness market is booming around the world, L’Oréal continues to invest in this sector, boosted by the successful relaunch of its premium skincare brand Helena Rubinstein, which made a comeback in Asia in late 2019. Buoyed by the interest of the Asian public in high-end, made-in-France skincare, the brand boasts excellent results and is performing well in its segment. With Carita, the cosmetics giant is investing in ultra-premium skincare, building on the brand’s very Parisian identity. In October 2022, after two years of works, the brand celebrated the rebirth of its iconic address at 11 Faubourg Saint-Honoré, in Paris, a hairdressing – and then Global Beauty – hot spot since 1952, when it was launched by the Carita sisters, Maria and Rosy. The year 2022 also saw the relaunch of a new skincare range consisting of 18 topical products: the offering was reworked and premiumized with new formulas and packaging. A brand-new facial cleansing foam will be released in mid-February 2023. These products are available as part of beauty treatments and elevated with a rich list of protocols at the Paris Maison de Beauté or at the Hotel Martinez in Cannes. Now that Carita has returned to Paris with great fanfare, China is the top priority. The brand products are available in beauty salons and as retail goods in the spas of renowned Chinese palaces: Mandarin Oriental in Shenzhen and Beijing, and Capella in Shanghai. Three dedicated brand outlets were also opened in Nanjing (Deji Plaza), Beijing (Beijing SKP), and Shanghai (Shanghai New World Daimaru). The group aims for Carita to keep expanding in China, and more widely in Asia, in the months and years to come. With its 1,800 square metres of floor space, the mansion, which houses the Carita Maison de Beauté on five floors, owes its new style to the talent of architects Sophie Thuillier and Cristiano Benzoni. Since it was opened, the place has been mainly visited by Parisian women and men (25% of men regularly come to the hairdressing salon), but also by fashion and movie celebrities. As the address perfectly embodies luxury à la française, a more global clientele is expected very soon, in particular Chinese customers. For the L’Oréal group, it also showcases the ambition and know-how of the Luxe Division, highlighting the beauty world in its “globalness”. The entrance to the building is through the iconic Carita porch. Then, customers walk under a series of arches to reach the sumptuous atrium, which gives an idea of the extent of the premises. The ground floor houses various areas, including a treatment bar with all the products in the range, a store with decorative objects and ready-to-wear, a reception desk, and a skin diagnosis area. Then, stairs (and a lift) lead to the eleven treatment suites and to the hair salon, located in the centre of the building, as a tribute to the two Carita sisters. The stylist team includes the famous hairdresser John Nollet, who has also been appointed Artistic Director of Carita. Right now, the L’Oréal Professionnel brand is used for hair care and styling, but a range of hair products by Carita may soon be launched. On the same floor as the hairdressing salon, eye care and semi-permanent makeup services are also offered. Plus, there is the 35-seat Rosy restaurant, served by chef Amandine Chaignot. The Maison de Beauté even has a 130 square metre flat that can be booked for private and professional events. On the top floor, the staff can go to the Carita Academy to practice and study during off-peak hours. Lastly, to pay tribute to the history of the Maison and the Carita sisters, a 245-page book, Carita - 11 Fbg Saint Honoré Paris, written by Laurence Benaim, has just been published by Éditions Assouline!"
Spanish fashion designer and fragrance king Paco Rabanne dead at 88,"“I am deeply saddened by the passing of Mr. Paco Rabanne. The history of Puig and Paco Rabanne began in the late 1960s with the launch of Calandre, the perfume created soon after the designer released ‘12 Unwearable Dresses in Contemporary Materials.’ A major personality in fashion, his was a daring, revolutionary and provocative vision, conveyed through a unique aesthetic. He will remain an important source of inspiration for the Puig fashion and fragrance teams, who continuously work together to express Mr. Paco Rabanne’s radically modern codes. I extend my sincere condolences to his family and to those who have known him,” stated Marc Puig, Chairman and CEO of the Puig group, which owned Rabanne’s label since the late 1960s. Francisco Rabaneda-Cuervo was born in 1934 in Spain’s Basque region, near the city of San Sebastian, where his mother was a seamstress for the designer Cristobal Balenciaga and his father was an army general. Rabanne’s life was uprooted by the Spanish Civil War when the army of dictator Francisco Franco turned on his father, a commander of the Guernica garrison, and gunned him down in 1936. In 1939 his family fled to France and Rabanne went on to study at the Beaux-Arts university in Paris, graduating with a diploma in architecture. Rabanne started out as a co-creator of the 1960s space-age movement in fashion alongside designers such as Pierre Cardin, who incorporated the era’s giddy excitement around the future and technological advancements into their clothes. His 1966 show brought immediate fame and notoriety when he stunned the audience with ""12 Unwearable Dresses"", his models dancing barefoot down the catwalk in outfits made of sharp metal and other unlikely materials. Which earned him to be dismissed as ""the metal worker"" by Coco Chanel. His influence nonetheless carried through many generations and he famously dressed global superstar Lady Gaga in outfits made entirely of paper for her 2011 appearance at the MTV Europe Music Awards. It was in 1968 that he signed a license agreement with the Puig family, who owned a perfume manufacturing and distribution business in Barcelona, for the exploitation of perfumes. The launch of ""Calandre"" then marked the first success of a long series. Since 1986, the Puig group, which also owns Nina Ricci, the Carolina Herrera brands and Prada and Comme des Garçons perfumes, has owned the entire Paco Rabanne house. ""Paco Rabanne made transgression magnetic. Who else could induce fashionable Parisian women to clamour for dresses made of plastic and metal?"" said Jose Manuel Albesa, President Puig Beauty & Fashion. Ever the provocateur, Rabanne had a penchant for mysticism and esoterism. In 1999 he predicted in his book ""Fire From Heaven"" that Paris would be destroyed later that year when the Russian space station Mir crashed down to Earth — a claim derived from his reading of the 16th-century French seer Nostradamus. ""To say that Paco Rabanne marches to his own drummer is an understatement,"" the New York Times wrote in 2002. ""He’s been called a futurist, couturier, mystic, madman, Dadaist, sculptor, architect, astrologer, perfumer, artist and prophet."""
Pierre Fabre wants to make Brazil its fifth global market,"Pierre Fabre Brasil has moved into new offices. The Group’s branch, which owns the Avène, Ducray and Darrow brands, inaugurated a new headquarters in Rio de Janeiro at the end of last year. More spacious, designed to support the growth of the teams and promote experience sharing and interaction between employees, these premises should accompany the company’s development in Brazil. ""This new headquarters marks the beginning of a new cycle. Our ambition is to reach 5th place in the company’s ranking by 2026, i.e. we want Brazil to be one of Pierre Fabre’s top five subsidiaries in the world"", explained CEO Ana Paula Magri. Currently, the country is the group’s 10th-largest market in terms of sales. In the last four years, the Group’s activity in Brazil has almost doubled, explained the manager. ""We are fortunate to operate in a market that has continued to grow, even during the health crisis. So much so that we chose to maintain our launches during the pandemic and have grown 1.5 times faster than the market in the last two years."" However, Pierre Fabre’s growth in Brazil is due to another factor. “It comes, in large part, from the bet we made to focus on the needs of Brazilians. This strategy has been in place since 2018, when we inaugurated our Brazilian Innovation Centre (BIC), by investing in research and technology to create products tailored to the needs of local consumers."" This is the company’s first innovation centre on the American continent and the second outside France. It is of great importance for the growth of the Group’s brands in Brazil, said Fernanda Chaves, Head of Technical Development. ""In just four years, the BIC has already developed several products for the local market. These include Darrow’s Actine cleansing gel with a new vitamin C formula and the Actine Colors sun lotion. At Avène, the Cleanance Intense cleansing gel and the Cleanance UV SPF70 sun lotion. All designed for the skin of Brazilian consumers."" Ana Paula Magri points out that Darrow and Avène are the leading brands in terms of sales. But Ducray, which was relaunched in Brazil six years ago, is in full swing. ""We are counting on all three brands to increase the weight of the Brazil business within the Group and reach our goal of doubling the size of our business in Brazil in the next four years"", said the CEO. Some other strategic operations should also help us achieve this goal. ""We will continue to focus strongly on dermatology, by expanding our team of visitors to introduce our upcoming launches to dermatologists. We consider all segments of dermo-cosmetics as promising, but six categories, which represent 90% of the Brazilian market, will draw our attention in the coming years. These are acne, sun care, body hydration, anti-ageing, hair and wound healing."" ""Another key building stone of our strategy is to continuously innovate. The dermo-cosmetic segment is driven by innovation, and every year new technologies and actives are launched. We believe that innovations in the Brazilian market will be increasingly linked to the requirements of the public and that many will be co-created in partnership with consumers and dermatologists, as we already do at Pierre Fabre”, concluded the CEO."
Glassmaker Waltersperger invests in new production capacity,"Waltersperger, the last French glassmaker to work exclusively with semi-automatic machinery, has positioned itself on the market with an offering that complements that of the major industrial glassmakers in the luxury sector. “We are very atypical, because we work in a semi-automatic way with a very traditional approach, since our glass is picked by hand. We therefore address the perfume bottling and spirits markets in a particular way, with greater flexibility on several levels”, explains Stéphanie Tourres, President and owner of the company she bought with her husband in April 2018. The first level of agility is the process, which delivers both hollow glass for bottles and pressed glass for jars and caps. The second level concerns production quantities. Waltersperger offers batches from 10 to 50,000 pieces. This is an advantage for brands with less ambitious orders and a big difference compared to industrial suppliers’ offerings. “Our core business ranges from 100 to 20,000 pieces. This is of interest to major clients who may request limited series or giant glass dummies, which we are the only ones to make in France, and also to niche brands, which represent a large panel of our customers”, says the Director. Ultimately, the company has enough flexibility to handle complex designs, such as the recent dog-shaped bottle of Bobby Miss Dior Limited. “The mould for the cap, a dog’s head, is composed of five parts, which cannot be done with fully automatic machinery. We can also provide a variety of bottle sizes, from 5-g caps to 4-kg bottles, which are also very difficult to produce with automatic lines, particularly due to the small quantities usually involved in these projects”, adds Stéphanie Tourres. Waltersperger also takes charge of the decoration of most of the bottles produced with the help of its local partners established in the Bresle valley, historically the valley of glass. “The local ecosystem of the Bresle valley is very rich. The glass moulds are ordered from the mould makers around us, and so are the decorations. This is very important, because it minimizes transport, adds responsiveness, boosts regional employment, and guarantees made-in-France manufacturing”, she continues. Since its takeover, the Waltersperger crystal glass company has found its place thanks to an alternative offering, and is experiencing constant growth which has enabled it to double its turnover in five years, reaching 5.3 million euros in 2022. At the same time, the team has grown from 28 to 40 employees. In order to implement the set development plan, the managing couple also wanted to redefine the production capacity by moving to a new, more suitable site. The new factory should be in operation by the end of the year on a 3,200 m2 site located in a High-Environmental-Quality-certified industrial zone, with a production area of 2,500 m2. It will be equipped with the current machines, seven small gas pot furnaces and about ten semi-automatic production machines, as well as new installations. “These machines allow for very small-scale production in one shift, so we will be adding a new oven in continuous feed with machines that can run 24 hours a day. This will drastically increase our glass tonnage capacity. We are going to go from one tonne to a potential four tonnes per day”, says Stéphanie Tourres. The site is also expected to be fitted with two additional lines, compared to the current four. The project represents an investment of 4.5 million euros, a significant effort in view of the company’s turnover and the current energy inflation and rising production costs: +35% for glass composition and +60% for packaging. “Two years ago, we chose gas for our new oven, because the technology to go electric is hugely more expensive for a small company. Today, the renegotiation of our gas contracts valid until the end of the year poses a major problem for the site’s start-up in terms of energy, but electricity prices have also tripled”, adds Stéphanie Tourres in conclusion."
"“Flowers enhance biodiversity”, Isabelle Sultan, Dior","Premium Beauty News – Why choose flowers as a key target? Isabelle Sultan - Flowers are very powerful enhancers of biodiversity. And yet, many studies show they are disappearing. According to a study conducted in September 2021 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), they are becoming extinct twice as fast as animals. Therefore, we need to protect and reintegrate them to the ecosystem. Our commitments and tangible actions for the environment and the climate included a specific role in this field. Flowers are part of our DNA. Christian Dior had a passion for flowers since his childhood. They surrounded his garden and he was fully aware of their power – they guided his inspiration. And of course, it is also because of our perfume business. There can be no perfume without flowers. Premium Beauty News – More specifically, what action do you take?
 Isabelle Sultan - Parfums Christian Dior has committed to using the power of flowers to regenerate ecosystems. We have 42 gardens or partner gardens around the world: in Grasse, of course, in the south of France, but also in Haiti, for vetiver, and in Madagascar. Our commitment lies in the transition of these 42 gardens towards organic and regenerative farming by 2030. 
By 2026, 100% of the natural raw materials cultivated in our gardens and partner gardens will also be certified by the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT), one of our key partners. The company has also been investing in research and partnerships to better understand the powerful role of flowers in maintaining biodiversity, natural ecosystems and local communities. We have also set up a partnership with Hectar, the world’s largest farming campus dedicated to regenerative agriculture, right next to Paris. The idea is to set up a research programme and partnerships to better understand the role flowers could play in helping biodiversity recover. This strategy will help support future owners, and I also hope it will change people’s opinion on the importance of re-flowering ecosystems. Premium Beauty News – Then, could we say that the notion of sustainability has become an integral part of the luxury world?
 Isabelle Sultan – To me, there is a close relationship between luxury, quality, and good practices: we make products designed to last. A study conducted by the Boston Consulting Group shows that 60% of consumers think it is up to us (luxury companies) to kick off the transition towards environmental protection. We have a real influence on what is desirable or not, and Gen Z demands virtuous practices associated with luxury and desirability. Everybody is aware that we need to turn things around. Consumers are also citizens, and they are ready. Premium Beauty News - Parfums Christian Dior was one of the first luxury brands to develop refillable skincare products and perfumes. Do consumers play their part?
 Isabelle Sultan - We have been working hard over the past few years to offer refillable solutions for our iconic products. Christian Dior already created refillable lipsticks in the 1950s. The offering of refillable products accounts for almost 20% of our portfolio. This proportion should keep increasing, and so will our ability to educate and influence. The first phase consists in broadening our offering and making it desirable. We need to take the time to get consumers used to these new consumption habits. Premium Beauty News – Other than refillable solutions, what are your targets in terms of packaging ecodesign?
 Isabelle Sultan – We believe it is our responsibility to make luxury standards change. The first priority is to have removed virgin fossil-based plastics from all packaging by 2028. Then, we will reduce the weight of packaging materials by 50% by 2030. Lastly, 100% of our packaging will be recyclable or refillable by 2028. For example, the refills of Crèmes Dior Prestige reduce the pack weight by 47% at the first refill, and by 63% starting from the second, which reduces the carbon footprint by 50%. In addition, thanks to the investment of LVMH in the development of the Eastman plastic recycling plant, Parfums Christian Dior will also take advantage of this innovative molecular recycling technology for plastic waste. The plant will be operational in 2025 and help the brand gradually eradicate its use of virgin fossil-based plastics. Premium Beauty News – You joined Parfums Christian Dior in January 2021 with a mission: take action as part of a new company sustainability strategy. What is your take on sustainability in the beauty and luxury worlds in the years to come? Isabelle Sultan – I am very optimistic as regards how the luxury industry will boost sustainability. At Parfums Christian Dior, we are very committed and motivated to integrate sustainability to all levels of our business, to all functions, and to all markets. With the support of Laurent Kleitman, President and CEO, and my whole team, we are doing our best to contribute to making the luxury industry rhyme with sustainability."
Global Beauty Consulting favours complex formulation challenges,"Over the past few years, Brittany-based GBC laboratory has positioned itself as the privileged partner of brands with expectations breaking with conventional approaches. “We have built ourselves the reputation to dive into complex territories. We always try to be one step ahead, whether in terms of galenic forms or of vision, meaning how we want to contribute to the cosmetic industry’s progress”, starts its founder, Gael Boutry. Gael Boutry has a passion for cosmetic formulation and an asserted taste for challenge: “I am interested in anything that is complex. We are actually less into making yet another anti-ageing cream”, he emphasizes. This approach seduces many brands, including those of the Clean Beauty generation, which are eager for new gestures, new galenic forms, and formulas redefined by natural alternatives. “Our customers are mainly emerging brands. GBC’s strength lies in helping them make formulas for which they hold the intellectual property rights. This way, they can start with small series of at least 500 SKUs: the made-in-France formulas belong to them, and they can explore complex territories”, Gael Boutry adds. The support process is global: the laboratory offers its ecosystem of packaging suppliers with similar values, as well as the possibility to benefit from economic feasibility studies conducted upstream. “From the beginning, brands are aware of the costs related to development and tests, as well as of the factory price. I prefer to refuse a project if I think it is not viable”, he warns. After several years working on the development of solid products, the formulator is now focusing on new concepts. “We made stick emulsions, like Hyalustick, which was developed with Superga and Cosmogen. It is a solid emulsion which requires waterproof packaging. But to me, hot-poured solid products, like shampoo or makeup-removing balms are just nonsense, from an environmental point of view. Of course, there is less packaging, but the raw materials used involve highly polluting manufacturing processes, high temperatures, then cooling processes… On the contrary, powder solutions require a cold process and much less energy”, he explains. So, he prefers powders to be reconstituted, “provided we work with people who are perfectly familiar with the powder-pressing technology”, explains Gael Boutry. “But there will be a limit in terms of sensoriality and distribution: there are not many solutions to distribute powder. With that in mind, we work upstream with packaging suppliers to help them develop tomorrow’s packs for powder applications, while making all our formula issues clear to them”. Global Beauty Consulting’s main working areas also include the use of fermented ingredients derived from upcycling and of biotechnologies for convenience raw materials. “Today, we are still highly limited in terms of functional natural ingredients, because biotechnologies are mostly used for the development of actives. Ingredient suppliers will increasingly work on this issue, but to me, the right thing is to also work with biodegradable synthesized products which have no impact on the environment. If everyone chooses the same path, we will not have enough natural ingredients for everyone”, warns Gael Boutry. To him, the search for alternatives has to take into account the formula/process combo on the industrial scale. “It is a good thing to make beautiful formulas in a laboratory, but it is better not to forget about the process, manufacturing, and packaging part”, he concludes. Well, that is a comprehensive vision of formulation."
"“Innovation also comes from manufacturers” Laurent Dodet, P&B Group","Premium Beauty News - Why did you take part in the Open Innovation event as a manufacturer/supplier? Laurent Dodet - We aimed to break the mould! It was the first time a designer and producer had taken part in it as a key player! We felt like sending a strong message by standing beside major market brands and suggesting an approach and solutions that stood out, compared to the usual proposals. Innovation can also come from manufacturers – like P&B. We were there to offer project initiators our agility, reactivity, and adaptability, which are at the core of our daily lives, but also our means, know-how, and resources: we develop these by working on a daily basis in an ever-denser, more dynamic environment. As a reminder, every year in our six plants, we work for over 200 brands, on about 1,000 projects. Premium Beauty News - How successful was it? Laurent Dodet - It was very positive and instructive. It helped carry out a comprehensive watch review by screening core issues, as well as all issues requiring reflection and creating emulation in the beauty ecosystem. We are still discussing a few specific subjects with project initiators to go ahead and actually set up support-based partnerships, the objective being to offer these innovations to our portfolio of customers. It is a win-win situation: project initiators get some support, we take advantage of a new innovation, and our customers have access to real differentiating solutions. Premium Beauty News - What are the main innovation solutions you noticed? Laurent Dodet - Most core and reflective issues are focused on sustainability, whether they regard ingredients, packaging, processes, or the product use. Also, new consumer gestures are usually correlated to real industrial challenges – the microbiome, a key issue right now, and the importance of technologies in beauty! Premium Beauty News - Can you tell us about your innovation or R&D projects? Laurent Dodet - As part of Open Innovation, we aim to acquire new formulation and industrial skills to offer our customers highly innovative solid solutions that create new gestures. Right now, we are discussing terms with the different players that caught our attention, so we cannot tell you more. But we are crossing our fingers for these partnership projects to come to fruition. Otherwise, our disruptive innovations include Advanced Water S-100, a new generation of ionized water. We strongly believe in this technology, because it keeps surprising us in increasingly diverse fields and applications. There is also our UHT technology to produce preservative-free cosmetics. And we support the Progelife and Calysens startups specialized in medicine and cosmetics. We believe in their projects and strategies and work hand in hand with them to develop anti-ageing ingredients."
Eurofragance acquires its partner in Indonesia and outs from the U.S.,"Eurofragance has announced plans to acquire its longstanding business partner PT Euronindo Fragrance in Indonesia. Effective on January 17, 2023, the transaction is expected to reinforce the presence of the Spanish fragrance house in the Asia Pacific region. Eurofragance plans to expand its development, and marketing and sales capabilities in the Indonesian market to be on par with local competitors on this market which represents important growth potential for the company. “Indonesia is a fast-moving country, this is the right time to invest further in a market which we entered over 20 years ago,” commented Santiago Sabateés, Founder and Chairman of Eurofragance during the official signature ceremony. The Spanish fragrance house entered into partnership with PT Euronindo Fragrance seven years ago. Formerly known as Kemikaroma, the company used to import finished goods from Singapore into Indonesia. “To date, the company has sustained unparalleled growth and puts us in a comfortable position to go head-to-head with some of the largest competitors in the sector,” underlines Laurent Mercier, CEO of Eurofragance. At the official closing date of the purchase, Edy Chandra, PT Euronindo’s actual Sales Manager will be promoted to Country Manager for the newly founded Eurofragance Indonesia. In parallel to this expansion in Asia, Eurofragance has decided to out from the U.S. market. The company has sold its Eurofragance LLC subsidiary, based in Middlesex, New Jersey to The Riverside Company, effective on December 6, 2022. Eurofragance’s entry on the United States market dates back to 2017, with the acquisition of a majority shareholding in Fragrance Design LLC, in Atlanta, Georgia. Mid-2020, the Barcelona-based perfume house outsourced its manufacturing capabilities to OnScent, owned by The Riverside Company. “After two and half years under this model, Eurofragance USA managed to triple its sales in this competitive market and hands over a promising business,” said Leandro Nonino, outgoing General Manager and Vice President Sales North America."
Puig relaunches Wikiparfum and opens office in Miami,"As far as fragrances are concerned, Puig is relaunching WikiParfum, its digital platform dedicated to discovering and deciphering perfume. Now available in seven languages and through a brand-new mobile app, WikiParfum (www.wikiparfum.com) gives users access to a vast online compendium of expert content, functionality and features developed by industry professionals. The digital platform enables everyone to browse, compare and choose fragrances from a constantly updated library which currently includes some 19,600 scents, compared to around 5,000 when it was launched initially in 2020. Above all, the platform offers several technological innovations to facilitate access to an olfactory world sometimes perceived as complex and distant by consumers. For instance, WikiParfum helps users discover what a perfume smells like, even before they try it in a store. When a user searches for a fragrance on the website or the app, a digital tool draws from a database containing 1,400 photographs of raw materials used in perfumery and organizes the images into a visual representation. According to Puig, this solution, or scent visualizer, allows the user to “see” the fragrance. The larger the image, the more dominant the ingredient. Displayed on a black background, the ingredient is intense; less so if the background is white. In addition to visual data, WikiParfum delivers key information, such as the perfume’s olfactory family, its main ingredients, the perfumer who created it, and the price range. A selection of related fragrances with similar ingredients completes the search results. To develop the tool, Puig has collaborated with Fragrances of the World, the largest independent guide to fragrance classification, created by fragrance authority and historian Michael Edwards. WikiParfum also wants to be a true personal perfume shopper. Based on the olfactory mapping of the database and on an individual’s stated preferences, the platform’s powerful algorithm provides users with personalized fragrance recommendations. Made for in-store use, the WikiParfum mobile app (available on Google Play and the App Store) features a barcode reader called EAN.Nose. Simply by scanning a perfume’s label at the point of sale, shoppers can “see” how the fragrance smells and learn key facts Completing the WikiParfum platform is AirParfum, the innovative airborne fragrance system patented and launched by Puig in 2018 for use at the point of sale. AirParfum addresses what was seemingly an intractable consumer pain point: the inability to sample multiple fragrances in-store without incurring olfactory saturation. AirParfum technology transforms purified air into perfumed air, enabling shoppers to experience scores of scents without confusion or sensory fatigue. At the same time, the group announced last week they will open a new office in Miami, Florida, in the U.S., as of January 2023. With this new regional hub, the family-owned beauty and fashion company aims “to support strong growth in the Americas.” Puig sells products in 150 countries and operates 29 subsidiaries."
Europe: a new challenge for French retailer Oh My Cream!,"Premium Beauty News - After 21 openings in France, Oh My Cream! is now crossing national borders, and the first stopover is the United Kingdom! Why choose England to start expanding abroad? Juliette Levy - At Oh My Cream!, we are very pragmatic. We are still a small company with a reduced team and limited means, which is why we thought accessibility – geographic proximity to the headquarters – and the language spoken might be the right choice for a first test on the global level, without using too much of our resources. The United Kingdom is the third European beauty market, after France and Germany, so it looked like the obvious solution to our equation. London is two hours and twenty minutes away from Paris by Eurostar, and the whole team at Oh My Cream! speaks fluent English, contrary to other languages like Italian or German. Premium Beauty News - Why decide to open two stores in two months? Juliette Levy - We aim to replicate the strategy we implemented in France in London, and all across the UK. We had not really planned to open two stores almost at the same time. However, opening a second store quickly, and then a third, etc., is definitely part of our action plan to expand in the UK. I instantaneously fell in love with the places we now occupy. The first, in Notting Hill, is a niche address which reminds me of our first venues in Paris: we stand next to trendy French brands like Sézane, Maje and Diptyque. The second is in Chelsea, on King’s Road. It is clearly the premium shopping destination par excellence. We definitely had to be there. These two places are complementary. And then, thinking about it, with my investors, of course, we concluded that by opening two stores almost at the same time, our message would be stronger and more impactful. To everyone’s eyes, we are the Clean Beauty retailer who is ready to take London, not a small concept store landing here randomly. Premium Beauty News - You opened your doors over a month ago in Notting Hill, and a few days ago in Chelsea: have you had any feedback yet? Juliette Levy - Londoners had been waiting for us, in particular as regards skincare. They are delighted with the insightful expertise they get, and which our competitors do not necessarily offer, i.e. Space NK, Boots, or department stores. And we have another asset: treatments are already doing very well here. Londoners indulge in skincare treatments and aesthetic medicine much more frequently and easily than French women do. In addition, if they have a real taste for face treatments, in particular facials, not all of them actually give in: a standard session at a facialist’s costs at least 300 pounds. Oh My Cream! treatments have bright days ahead, that is for sure! Our own brand, Oh My Cream Skincare, is really successful. Obviously, they are exclusive products there, so they appeal to a population eager for novelty. Plus, they are affordable, so the buying act is quite simple. Oh My Cream Skincare sun products are doing even better than expected. Londoners use sun products on a daily basis: they are an integral part of their daily routines. Almost one customer out of two asks us for a sun block when they step in our store! Premium Beauty News - After the United Kingdom, what country were you thinking about? Juliette Levy - The Oh My Cream!, Beauty Destination 2.0 concept could meet consumer expectations beyond European borders, but it is not our main objective right now. We aim to succeed in expanding in the UK, and then in Belgium, where we have started developing: we will open two stores in Brussels in the first semester 2023. Belgium is our first foreign market right now in terms of online sales. We know we can have our own place there, but at a smaller scale than in England, of course. In two years, we will most probably expand in another neighbouring country: why not Italy, which loves skincare, but it is too soon to tell."
Cottan Paris 1840 reinterprets the origins of cosmetics,"One day, as collector Gaël Bascoul was taking a deep plunge into the past, he came across old formulas handwritten by Jean-François Arsène Cottan, a chemist and cosmetologist who worked with Guerlain and Molinard, in the middle of the 19th century. Gaël Bascoul had already founded the brand Monsieur Barbier, so he immediately saw an obvious opportunity to awaken a precious, much contemporary intellectual heritage. Helped by Jean-Claude Le Joliff, the President of La Cosmétothèque, a website designed to preserve and retain cosmetics sciences, techniques and know-how, he works on reinterpreting formulas based on the foundations imagined by the renowned chemist. “We restore a heritage which corresponds to today’s trends. Clean Beauty is hailed as a new phenomenon, but it was actually the basis of cosmetics in the 19th century. Mr. Cottan also promised his products were compatible with delicate skins, as they moisturized them and did not make them dry out. From the first findings, and every time we discovered a product, we could not but be captivated by the modernity of his work and acknowledge, with much humility, that what we had was a bit of our history which had unfairly fallen into oblivion”, says Gaël Bascoul. The development of the range revives one of the main principles of the Cottan routine, i.e. cleansing, exfoliating, and moisturizing: hygiene fundamentals as a skincare base. “One of the aspects which caught our attention was that the simplicity of the approach could not but make us think of others which, much later, were based on the same three key gestures: cleanse, tone up, and hydrate”, adds Jean-Claude Le Joliff. As a consequence, the formulation laboratory follows this guiding principle: few products – three, so far – with simple formulas based on the concepts of the past and carefully selected safe ingredients. The range is composed of a cleansing soap based on plants, an exfoliating micellar vinegar with fruit acids, and a moisturizing vanishing face cream. “Vinegars were widely used in cosmetics for hygiene and skin-balancing purposes. They are excellent postbiotics. Acids support the tissue regeneration process called epidermal renewal”, explains the formulator. The vanishing cream, as opposed to the cold cream, offers the softness of a light, non-oily texture. “This revived formulation skeleton results in galenic forms that had been forgotten”, says Ganaël Bascoul. The brand reinterprets and modernizes original formulas. This mosaic of the past also inspired an identity, with Art Deco visual codes and packaging based on vintage materials. The beauty vinegar bottle is made of glass, a refill project is under study, and the face cream is packed in an aluminium tube which reminds of ointments, and fitted with an octagonal cap made from recycled plastic. Since they were launched in 2021, the Cottan Paris 1840 products have seduced not only French consumers on the brand’s e-shop and at the Printemps department store, but also foreign markets: the brand is settling in Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. To the founder, it just shows the interest in French heritage and innovation, and it conveys the idea of a “niche cosmetics segment based on different principles” which, just like on the perfumes market, puts an emphasis on heritage brands. In Europe, they are available for about 20 to 40 euros, which remains affordable for a high-end design. To keep restoring this beautiful past, Ganaël Bascoul aims to update the rest of his precious catalogue. The next projects will involve a cleansing powder based on peony root to be rehydrated. “Powder products were much common at that time”, explains the founder. There will also be a plant-powered oil for healthy skin, a blend of floral waters… A “new Art of the Formulation” inspired from the past is under way."
"How LanzaTech turns greenhouse gases into ethanol, bottles and dresses","That ethanol is then used as a chemical building block for consumer items such as plastic bottles, athletic wear and even dresses, via tie-ins with major brands such as Zara and L’Oréal. ""I wouldn’t have thought that 14 years later, we would have a cocktail dress on the market that’s made out of steel emissions,"" said microbiologist Michael Kopke, who joined LanzaTech a year after its founding. LanzaTech is among 15 finalists for the Earthshot Prize, an award for contributions to environmentalism launched by Britain’s Prince William and broadcaster David Attenborough. Five winners will be announced Friday. To date, the company says it has kept 200,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, while producing 50 million gallons (190 million liters) of ethanol. That’s a small drop in the bucket when it comes to the actual quantities needed to combat climate change, Kopke concedes. But having spent 15 years developing the methodology and proving its large-scale feasibility, the company is now seeking to ramp up its ambition and multiply the number of participating factories. ""We really want to get to a point where we only use above ground carbon, and keep that in circulation,"" says Kopke — in other words, avoid extracting new oil and gas. LanzaTech, which employs about 200 people, compares its carbon recycling technology to a brewery — but instead of taking sugar and yeast to make beer, it uses carbon pollution and bacteria to make ethanol. The bacteria used in their process was identified decades ago in rabbit droppings. The company placed it in industrial conditions to optimize it in those settings, ""almost like an athlete that we trained,"" said Kopke. Bacteria are sent out in the form of a freeze-dried powder to corporate clients in China, which have giant versions of the vats back in Chicago, several meters high. The corporate clients that built these facilities will then reap the rewards of the sale of ethanol — as well as the positive PR from offsetting pollution from their main businesses. The clients in China are a steel plant and two ferroalloy plants. Six other sites are under construction, including one in Belgium for an ArcelorMittal plant, and in India with the Indian Oil Company. Because the bacteria can ingest CO2, carbon monoxide and hydrogen, the process is extremely flexible, explains Zara Summers, LanzaTech’s vice president of science. ""We can take garbage, we can take biomass, we can take off gas from an industrial plant,"" said Summers, who spent ten years working for ExxonMobil. Products already on the shelves include homecare products sold on the shelves of the Migros supermarket chain, in Switzerland, as well as a line of dresses at Zara. Sold at around $90, they are made of polyester, 20 percent of which comes from captured gas. Once purified, to remove any residual odor, this ethanol is also used to manufacture Coty group perfumes. The creation of perfumery ingredients is even being considered with Givaudan. ""In the future, I think the vision is there is no such thing as waste, because carbon can be reused again,"" said Summers. LanzaTech has also founded a separate company, LanzaJet, to use the ethanol to create ""sustainable aviation fuel"" or SAF. Increasing global SAF production is a huge challenge for the fuel-heavy aviation sector, which is seeking to green itself. LanzaJet is aiming to achieve one billion gallons of SAF production in the United States per year by 2030. Unlike bioethanol produced from wheat, beets or corn, fuel created from industrial greenhouse gas emissions doesn’t require the use of agricultural land. For LanzaTech, the next challenge is to commercialize bacteria that will produce chemicals other than ethanol. In particular, they have their sights set on directly producing ethylene, ""one of the most widely used chemicals in the world,"" per Kopke — thus saving energy associated with having to first convert ethanol into ethylene."
Ingestible skincare: Increasingly demanding consumers,"As a manufacturer of high-performing liquid collagen products for the beauty, health, and wellness sector, Tosla Nutricosmetics has been eager to adapt the ‘clean beauty’ concept to the ingestible category. For example, all their formulas are therefore sugar, GMO, gluten, and lactose-free. So, like what happened in the topical skin care industry, Tosla Nutricosmetics thinks that: “As consumers learn more about ingestible collagen products, they will become stricter and more selective in their choices. This will drive companies and brands to more innovative and sophisticated products, that will also deliver on the key consumer needs in beauty (aging, hydration, protection from oxidative stress, pigmentation, etc.).” Moreover, just as texture and fragrance are key factors of success for topical cosmetics, taste is a key issue for ingestible cosmetics. “And our liquids offer a far better experience than powders, gummies, or tablets, whether in terms of taste, smell and texture,” claims Primož Artač, COO & Founder of Tosla Nutricosmetics. To meet these new expectations, Tosla relies on quality and their capacity for innovation. Their VELIOUS™ Masking Technology, for instance, helps them to address taste - the most important differentiation factor in the liquid collagen category - without adding sugar to their formulas. In order to provide efficient formulations that target skin texture, density and hydration, Tosla Nutricosmetics can rely on their EU-based manufacture [1] and in-house R&D & Production Design to enhance the efficiency of their products and all aspects of the user experience. Furthermore, Tosla Nutricosmetics has performed clinical tests of their three best-selling formulations, thus substantiating claims related to reduced wrinkles and smoother skin and guaranteeing brands and their consumers the high-performance of their products. “We spotted the market shift towards beauty from within, and we have high-quality standards. Industry-leading companies recognise our mission, and we successful teamed up with many, and the best is yet to come,” concludes Tosla."
C’leene toothpaste combines healthy formulas with fluorine,"Céline Benaroch, PhD in Pharmacy, pays close attention to the composition of toothpaste, a personal hygiene essential. Two years ago, she chose to work with a dental health professional to create a formula which met her expectations: toothpaste free from controversial ingredients, but powered by fluorine. “Toothpaste is a product which can be partly ingested. And we use it our whole lives as early as childhood: it is our first hygiene cosmetic product. Most of the products available on the market contain the right quantity of fluorine, but two out of three also contain titanium dioxide, a component suspected of being carcinogenic. In France, it is banned in foodstuffs. In parallel, clean beauty brands choose to ban fluorine which, to me, is nonsense”, she explains. Although it is generally not used in clean formulas due to the potential risk of fluorosis, an enamel disorder observed in children which results from overdosage, fluorine is essential to good dental health, according to the entrepreneur. “Dentists report a surge of tooth decay in children, following the use of toothpaste free from fluorine. And yet, fluorosis only affects 2% of children. What is important is to watch children brush their teeth, until they turn 6 or 7, and check they use a very small quantity of toothpaste, so they do not ingest too much product”, says Céline Benaroch. The C’leene formulas comply with very strict specifications. The fluorine concentration is 1,000 ppm in the toothpaste for children from 0 to 6, and 1,450 ppm in the adult version, in accordance with the levels recommended by health authorities. “Our products are organic-certified by Ecocert and made in France. But the other criteria are taste, freshness, texture, and foam. We have worked a lot on that”, she adds. Not only the C’leene toothpaste revisits standard formulas, but it is also innovative in terms of packaging. Each version comes in a refillable pump bottle based on biodegradable bioplastic, except for the pump, for which Céline Benaroch has not found any alternative. The refills are packed in pouches made of paper derived from apple waste. “The pump bottle is very convenient, because it contributes to children’s autonomy. There is no cap, it does not break, and it delivers the quantity needed”, says Céline Benaroch. After an Ulule fundraising campaign launched last June, the C’leene range is now in the production phase. Starting from January, it will be available on the brand’s website for EUR 10.90 per bottle, and EUR 7.90 per 100-ml refill. Then, it should be distributed in pharmacies and specialized stores. “The campaign on social media had a huge impact. We received a lot of messages from dental surgeons who will not recommend fluorine-free toothpaste. They were looking for a formula like ours, with a healthy composition, and fluorine”, concludes Céline Benaroch."
Orijinal launches a solution for endless reuse of nail polish bottles,"Born in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, Orijinal stands out for its natural care varnishes containing a patented active ingredient based on French celery and an organic pomegranate extract. Aware of the environmental impact of nail varnishes, Cheryl Gava, the brand founder, has imagined a solution allowing the glass bottles of her nail polishes to be reused over and over again, when they are returned by consumers. Each time a new product is received, consumers can return a bottle when it is empty. The concept is quite simple. All consumers have to do is order a first nail polish on the brand’s e-shop, then use it until they run out - a detail that is important. Indeed, Orijinal specifies it only recovers “used bottles”, which actually means “empty bottles”. From the second order, consumers can indicate that they wish to return their old bottle, which will allow them to receive the new product together with a postage-paid label to return the empty primary container. To make reuse possible, the brand has invested in a cleaning process derived from the food industry, which allows the bottles to be cleaned in just 16 minutes using a procedure that is “as eco-responsible as possible”, specifies Orijinal. However, the solution only works if consumers really reduce waste, that is to say if they (really) use their nail varnish to the last drop. A practice that still seems uncommon in real life. Therefore, in order to motivate as many people as possible to change their habits, the brand is offering a voucher for each five bottles returned. But that’s not all! The wooden cap can be separated from the plastic applicator brush to be reused too. If it is damaged, the consumer can ask to receive a new one for the same price. Nail polishes pose specific problems at the end of their life. The French Agency for Ecological Transition (ADEME) recommends ""throwing the glass bottle in the bin or container intended for recyclable glass packaging,"" which will generally allow it to be recycled, and ""throwing the brush and its cap in the household waste bin.” Orijinal therefore offers an alternative to the thermal recycling of glass, which is energy-intensive but remains common in France. On the other hand, if the bottle is not empty, ADEME recommends to dispose it in a recycling centre that accepts this specific type of product."
Mustela kicks into gear in Brazil with new developments and a local production,"“We have noticed that many parents who buy products for their children also use them for themselves,” says Marilla Mesquita, marketing and CSR manager at Mustela in Brazil. The brand therefore began by extending efficacy studies of certain existing lines, such as sun protection, before developing products specifically intended for family use. In 2021, Mustela launched its organic BIO line in Brazil, before launching its new multifunctional organic balm, which draws on the benefits of avocado to restore and hydrate the skin of all family members, whatever their age. For Mustela, this new positioning is much more than a means of winning over new consumers, it is also part of a responsible approach to avoid multiplying purchases of products that would only fit for some members of the family. “Consumers are increasingly looking for natural or organic and vegan products. But we have also seen a strong demand for simplicity, through multifunctional products that serve different family members,” Marilla Mesquita points out. The brand therefore plans to expand its offering of family products over the years. “We are going to launch a solid shampoo for the body and hair, which will be part of our BIO range, both offering a vegan, organic and biodegradable formula enriched with avocado and olive oils for the whole family,” says the marketing manager. In 2023, Mustela will celebrate the tenth anniversary of its entry on the Brazilian market. The brand now intends to gain in efficiency by producing locally some of its iconic items. In addition, the brand plans to start developing new products in Brazil as early as 2024, in order to better meet the specific needs of national consumers. “This strategy is fully aligned with our commitments to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030, as well as to positively impact communities and co-create 100% of our new products with families, ensuring that future generations grow up healthy and on a healthy planet,” continues Marilla Mesquita. Sold in almost 10,000 points of sale in Brazil, mainly in the pharmaceutical retail channel and in e-commerce, Mustela has doubled its turnover in the country every three years. “We are already the brand’s sixth biggest subsidiary and we still have great potential for growth. Brazil is therefore one of the Mustela’s priority markets,” concludes the manager."
Capsum partners with Orius to create a vertical farm at its Texas facility,"Capsum continues to invest in the indoor production of botanical ingredients. The integration of plant-based ingredient production capabilities into Capsum’s manufacturing plant in Texas will enable the company to control the entire production chain and to fulfil its vision of Seed-to-Face cosmetics creation. A specialist of microfluidics, the company is completing its offer with natural, responsible and efficient active ingredients to serve American beauty brands with additional sustainable and innovative benefits to include in their cosmetics. Capsum’s innovative bio-production facility is planned to be autonomous in water and energy, powered by 2 acres of solar panels installed on the roof. It will start with production of sunflower microgreens and rapidly expand to other active ingredients from natural origin, including flower and root extracts. The technology that implemented at the Texas facility combines indoor farming and precision farming. Traditionally associated with greens and vegetables production, indoor farming is a technique to grow plants on vertically stacked racks, typically in a soil-less, closed-loop hydroponics setup which optimizes space and resources and doesn’t require the use of pesticides. While precision farming is a scientific approach to cultivation that aims at steering plant development through precise control of the environmental and biotic parameters, and can be leveraged to boost the chemical composition of the plants in molecules of interest. Precision Indoor Farming brings together the two cultivation techniques for the production of plants boosted in active molecules of interest while minimizing environmental impact. The technique offers several benefits, including: the production of more active molecules, the reduction of water and energy consumption, a low carbon footprint, and a secured supply. As an example, flowers produce phenolic compounds at sunrise that can be boosted in quantity by prolonging the specific environmental conditions - typically temperature and quantity of light - that signal dawn to the plant. First trials indicate a threefold increase in total polyphenols contents produced by the plant compared to traditional growth conditions. In order to boost the development of this technology, Capsum has acquired a minority stake in the start-up, which was established in Toulouse, France, in 2021. The two companies think that using precision indoor farming offers a solution to the constraints related to the creation of new ingredients develop active ingredients in beauty by: combining naturality and performance, contributing to Clean beauty, offering large sustainability assets, bringing better transparency and securing the supply chain, contributing to brand uniqueness. “Capsum chose Orius to setup its Precision Indoor Farm in Austin, TX, because of their credentials and skills in high-tech farming. While developing the project, both teams had such a great experience in sharing knowledge and ambition that they decided to partner to transform the Beauty Industry using Precision Indoor Farming,” says Sébastien Bardon, Capsum CEO. As pharmaceutical and nutraceutical sectors are evolving following similar trends and constraints, Capsum deems that Orius perspectives are promising beyond beauty."

Why should you create immersive experiences in communication?,"An immersive brand experience proposes an enriched environment that encourages the audience to use its senses, to feel involved and to interact. Immersion takes various forms in brand communication strategy and adapting content creation – physical spaces transformed to invite the audience into the brand universe, augmented reality and spaces using virtual reality or 3D, holograms, light projections, gaming spaces, customization possibilities… The new brand content wants to be engaging, different and emotional. The agency WANDS Paris develops innovative approaches and sources the best technologies for their deployment. The end of year period represents a key moment for brands that need to stand out. The brand L’Occitane en Provence has solicited the agency WANDS to think of a concept and immersive digital experience for all their markets worldwide around their star product for this period – the advent calendar. This example highlights the reasons why immersion is of paramount importance to reach marketing objectives. Immersion and its uses in a multi-channel structure provide an amplification and resolution of brand objectives: memorization by the audience, whose cognitive aspects are activated; engagement which is provoked by the emotional aspect of the experience; growing notoriety of the brand offering an experience to share; and differentiation, by a unique communication line. A study outlines that 61% of consumers would be more likely to buy from brands who use immersive technology, such as augmented or virtual reality and 3D content. Hence, for L’Occitane, several specific objectives were defined before starting the project to develop special features: the accessibility of the experience which needed to be user and mobile friendly; conversion by encouraging gifting and advent calendar sales; a boost of traffic and engagement; and finally, the ability to collect data and KPIs. The concept that was developed corresponds to these objectives while bringing surprise and playfulness. The approach by the agency WANDS began by an exploration of the brand universe – that of L’Occitane of Provence is rich, authentic, colorful, engaged. From a study of the brand values and the theme of the year – crafters of nature – as well as a reinterpretation of the illustrative and chromatic range of the universe, a global concept has emerged. The ambition was to indulge the audience in the enchanted world of the brand through three digital activations that fit into the e-commerce website. WANDS has worked on the artistic direction, the design, and the development of an immersive landing page with the main objective of converting. The aim was not only to highlight the advent calendars in an immersive page design and to propose a direct “Add to cart”, but to explain the characteristics and differences of each calendar, and their unique selling propositions. The customer journey has been optimized to define the shortest way to the cart. Finally, a widget invites the audience to discover other products. The animation is integrated within the e-commerce website through an HTML code or iFrame, offering an enchanted parenthesis. The second animation brings to light a virtual advent calendar that aims to drive traffic, conversion and engagement in more than 26 countries. The agency has imagined a 3D setting with a Christmas tree formed by cubes, turning on a pedestal and using visual elements from the holiday campaign. Every day, one box opens itself upon a click, to reveal an offer, keeping the suspense of the discovery for the audience. A form allows data collect and the reception of the offers by email. Just like the first animation, this experience is customizable by each country, in terms of images, texts, links and email template. A communication plan accompanies the animation to explain the concept of the virtual advent calendar. Finally, the third animation is more experimental and implies the audience participation with a Gift Finder – through questions and answers to find the ideal gift. The originality resides in the design of the experience, based upon the artistic direction of the global experience and an animated 3D box at each step. After answering the questions, the box opens itself in an explosion of ribbons, provoking surprise, before revealing suggested gifts. The stakes for the brand were multiple: the importance of being immerged into the brand universe, the storytelling, the adaptation with the e-commerce website of each market, adapted UI and UX, the presentation of the USP (unique selling proposition), and the specificities of each market. Artistic design, 3D content creation, simple consumer journey, brand immersion, technical development… To these criteria, the brand added an essential one: the international dimension of the project to guarantee the holistic dimension of the brand and to allow the local adaptation by several countries. Indeed, each experience is customizable by the markets who can change the text and thus, the language (including Arabic or Mandarin for instance), the visual assets, the links and template. Customization is offered to the users through a personalized back office. Furthermore, the users can be managed by an administrator who can handle different access levels. The data from the audience can be downloaded safely by each market. For an optimal operation, the integration of Google Analytics in the back office allows for the a follow-up and tracking of the animations, to obtain the relevant KPIs – number of clicks, length of sessions, bounce rate… Technology is as the service of an immersive and innovative approach, and invites the user to wonder within the brand universe. WANDS Paris tells stories and brings to light in a strategic and innovative way brands that are sensitive to excellence, luxury and premium. "
"“Luxury hotels contribute to Sothys’ growth”, Christian Mas","Premium Beauty News - Is Sothys’ story rooted in French cosmetics? Christian Mas - At the beginning, in 1946, Sothys was a Parisian beauty salon. It was purchased by my family in 1966. The salon stood out because they made their own formulas. So, the brand got part of what I call the new wave of French beauty, with the Carita sisters, Nadia Payot, and all this flourishing, pioneering generation of cosmetologists and craftspeople. My father, Bernard Mas, soon made the brand operational to sell his formulas in France and beyond. We went from a craft business to an SME. In the 1970s, industrialization naturally became a possibility: my father chose to go back to Corrèze, where he built the brand’s plant, because our family roots were there. And this choice became a real strength. Premium Beauty News - How did the brand grow on the global level? Christian Mas - My uncle developed sales in France and my father mainly focused on our growth on the global scale, always through the professional network – they stuck to their first choice. We have very strong stories for our export distribution networks, in particular in the US. In the 1980s, we set up a second local production plant in Miami, Florida, which is now celebrating its 40th anniversary, and then a platform for Asia based in Singapore. Today, we are well-established in about 60 countries and distributed in 90 countries, with a strong presence on both all European markets and our two main subsidiaries’ markets, the US and Singapore. One subsidiary represents 5 to 60 people, one logistics centre, one sales team, local trainers to explain how to use our methods and products, and a marketing hub. Premium Beauty News - What is Sothys today? Christian Mas - My brother and I took over more than ten years ago. We kept growing in the beauty salon industry, almost reaching the top position, with 15,000 addresses around the world. Sothys has no wholly-owned salon, except the one located 128, Rue Saint Honoré, the historical address that will reopen in January 2023, after some embellishments. The group achieves a consolidated turnover of more or less 50 million euros, 65% to 70% of which is achieved on the global level. We also successfully entered the high-end hotel sector: we are present in about a hundred four- or five-star hotels in France and in a few beautiful places around the world (Hanoi, Osaka, Bora Bora, Marrakech, Monaco…). Our development strategy is based on our customers’ loyalty to our network. Without the service to appeal to customers, it is complicated. So, we remain in beauty salons and we aim to develop in the hotel sector through our subsidiaries abroad. Premium Beauty News - Sothys highlights values close to Nature. How is that conveyed in your formulas? Christian Mas - When we succeeded him, as a visionary, my father created a botanical garden in Corrèze, in my grandfather’s village, Auriac. He put a lot of energy into it, and now this four-hectare botanical garden helps us study the biotope in its 150 hectares of protected forest. Our visitors can discover how Sothys interacts with its environment. We have green expertise and we work on our flagship actives with the garden. All this is done with local producers, saffron growers in the Lot region, or birch sap locally harvested for our organic range. Premium Beauty News - What makes the Sothys products stand out? Christian Mas - Our truth comes from salon treatments. Our laboratory counts about thirty scientists and an integrated salon. Everything is done in vivo, between researchers and field people, and product development takes place at the same time as the treatment phase. That is what makes the difference. About fifty new formulas are created every year for the brand, and they are sold or used in beauty salons. Premium Beauty News - Can you tell us about the next launches? Christian Mas - Next year, our organic face range will be completed with a body range. There will also be seasonal treatments and collaborations with French brands sharing the same values. Next January, we will also announce a major launch: a new range of Sothys hotel amenities. We will meet all hotel room needs with a “plastic neutral”, refillable range. Everything is produced at our plant, and the products will be the same as in beauty salons. Premium Beauty News - To finish, how do you define the Sothys woman? Christian Mas -  She is a 40/45-year-old woman who likes going to beauty salons. But with social media and our hotel presence, our average customer is getting younger. Consumers are aware of our values. In the hotel industry, we also have 30% to 40% of men coming for treatments, so we have reached a new customer category."
"Proya, one of China’s strongest beauty brands in 2022","Initially specialized in skincare essentials, the brand based in Hangzhou, near Shanghai, took a strategic turn in 2019 when it launched the Black Sea Salt Bubble Mask, now a bestseller with monthly sales above a million units on the Tmall platform. Then, it was equally successful with the Ruby Lightening Serum and the Double Youth Essence. By limiting launches to two products per year, the brand highlights its sophisticated ingredients, like red algae extracts, peptides, and retinol. Proya believes that in the cosmetics industry, success will now depend on the power of research: they recently announced the opening of their own R&D centre. “Proya catches the new consumer trend: it is very popular among the Chinese ’ingredients party’ consumers, the ones who focus on formulations, as it has strong scientific ingredients and perfect product formulas. It also plays with the China pride, for example by taking part in the Harper’s Bazaar campaign ‘The brilliant Chinese ingredient’”, explains Juliette Duveau, co-founder of consulting agency The Chinese Pulse, specialized in modern China’s trends, confirming that Proya has very strong R&D capability and an independent laboratory. To her, “ Proya is a pioneer in creating new skincare concepts : because VC and VA are irritating for sensitive skin, overseas brands have not made them the focus of their efforts. However, Proya has become the pioneer of the concept of ’anti-oxidation + anti-sugar at the same time’ and is the leader of ’morning VC night VA skincare’ concept,” explains Juliette Duveau. Likewise, as far as marketing is concerned, “Proya catches new marketing trends quickly: it is one of the earliest beauty brands that started to be active on social media e-commerce => start live-commerce, and expand on the new emerging Chinese social platforms: RED, Douyin, Tmall, JD.COM, VIP.COM, etc.” In addition, its communication campaigns stand out, while emotionally resonating in young people and women. Without ever putting a product forward, they convey committed messages, like the viral video broadcast during the 2021 Woman’s Day, which pointed at sexist stereotypes. The campaign slogan, “genre is not a limit, prejudices are” (#性别不是边界线 偏见才是#), was seen more than 300 million times on Weibo. Empathy seems to be the common theme of these ad campaigns that screen the Chinese society. After the summer 2022, the brand launched an awareness campaign against school harassment in collaboration with China Education Television. Not long before that, for the romantic celebration called Qixi, Proya chose to support the many Chinese single people who have to cope with family and society pressure to find a partner. With the slogan “dare to love, dare not to love” (#敢爱也敢不爱#), the brand clearly differentiated itself from other brands’ many set launches. “The reason for this success is a combination of 3 axes: product + marketing + communication,” says Juliette Duveau. The brand, which has been listed on the Shanghai stock exchange since 2017, increased its turnover by 36.9% in the first semester 2022, reaching 2.6 billion RMB (372 million euros): it is one of the most profitable brands in the industry, according to Chinese news website 36Kr. The website specialized in finance highlights that this performance is all the more remarkable that “the Chinese cosmetics market is under pressure, shaken by the control of the Covid pandemic and the fact that logistics were put on hold in certain areas”. According to 36Kr, Proya’s resistance is due to a high proportion of its sales being achieved online, mainly through Tmall, Douyin (TikTok), and Jd.com. From 2018 to 2021, Proya’s online share rose from 43.6% to 85.4%. In terms of positioning, “Proya is a mid-range brand (200-400 RMB) and remains affordable for most students and young graduates, especially during shopping festivals and in live-commerce,” explains Juliette Duveau. Its success is due to highly efficient products combined with reasonable prices – a winning strategy on a Chinese high-end market still dominated by Western brands."
Cosmoprof Asia is back in Singapore on 16-18 November 2022,"To make the return of the trade show happen, the Cosmoprof Asia team chose to relocate the event from its home base of Hong Kong to Asia neighbour Singapore. A highly accessible venue for international exhibitors and buyers, Singapore welcomes fully vaccinated visitors without pre-departure tests, on-arrival tests or quarantine requirements. As one of the world’s most connected countries, Singapore can be reached through Changi Airport, which serves more than 85 international airlines flying to about 100 cities across 46 countries and regions globally. Visitor registration is now open at www.cosmoprof-asia.com. “Cosmoprof and Cosmopack Asia are proud to return to the physical event format, offering world-wide exhibitors and consumers a safe venue in which to meet and greet suppliers, experience products in-person, and learn about the region’s most compelling trends,” said David Bondi, Senior Vice President - Informa Markets Asia and Director of Cosmoprof Asia Ltd. According to the organizers, despite the two-year hiatus, strong support for the fair has already been proven through the upcoming participation of over 1,000 exhibitors from 40 countries and regions. Companies will showcase their offerings across five halls (from Hall 2 to 6) at the Singapore EXPO, covering an exhibition area of up to 50,000 sqm. The 17 country and regional pavilions include: Australia, California, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mainland China, Malaysia, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Türkiye and UK. Thanks to the strong line-up of exhibitors, more than 15,000 attendees are expected to visit the fair to discover new products and the trends inspiring beauty consumers in the region. Among pre-registered visitors: 20% are from Singapore, 12% from China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, 43% from the rest of Asia, 10% from Europe, 5% from Australasia, 5% from North America and 5% from the rest of the world. “We are excited to meet our beauty community again, this time in Singapore, for the next edition of Cosmoprof and Cosmopack Asia,” said Gianpiero Calzolari, President of BolognaFiere. “The event is a not-to-be-missed opportunity for stakeholders to understand how consumers habits continue to change in the Asia-Pacific region, and how to develop new projects and proposals to meet the specific needs of this market. We are ready to offer our best performing services and tools to attendees, to help them develop new business projects.” Sustainability will be one of the key topics for Day 1 at CosmoTalks, the educational programme by Cosmoprof and Cosmopack 2022, featuring key trends, experts and analysts. On Day 2, sessions will include Trends Forecast and Digital Beauty, while Day 3’s main topics will be Market Watch and Regulation. Among the partners who will take part in CosmoTalks 2022 are APSWC (Asia Pacific Spa Wellness Coalition), Asia Cosme Lab, Beautystreams, CTFAS (The Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association of Singapore), Ecovia Intelligence, Reach24, and re-sources.com. In an exclusive collaboration for Cosmoprof and Cosmopack Asia, the international trend agency Beautystreams will present the CosmoTrends Report, showcasing key trends spotted among the exhibitors, and highlighting notable brands and products anticipated to have a strong impact on consumers in the Asia-Pacific market. Eventually, Cosmo Onstage will present live demos, product presentations, and innovative treatments to beauty and spa professionals, hair stylists and nail artists. As one of the special services of the Cosmoprof International network, the Buyer Programme facilitates direct contact between exhibitors (brands and suppliers) on one side, and selected buyers, distributors and retailers on the other. The Cosmoprof Asia 2022 Buyer Programme will host around 300 selected buyers from across the world, including Australia, ASEAN countries, India, Korea, Japan, Europe, Middle East and the US, to attend scheduled meetings with suppliers and companies with common interests during the three-day show. In addition, exhibitors and pre-registered buyers can make use of the AI-driven Match&Meet platform to plan ahead for the 3-day exhibition by previewing target suppliers/buyers’ profiles and pre-scheduling onsite meetings efficiently."
"""Blissim focuses on pleasure rather than price,"" Quentin Reygrobellet","Premium Beauty News - E-commerce has experienced a real explosion during the health crisis and the closure of physical stores. Where do you stand today? Quentin Reygrobellet - After the strong growth of the 2020-2021 period, we are consolidating our gains by building loyalty among our members. With a turnover of 50 million euros, we have maintained double-digit profitability, which is quite remarkable in e-commerce. Our growth has slowed down, of course, but at a time when e-commerce is experiencing difficulties, we are lucky to have a differentiating model. Even if the accessibility of our boxes or our advent calendar contributes greatly to their success, we count on other elements than price: quality and personalization of the service, diversity of the offer, advice, discovery, pleasure and fun. Our mission is to surprise and delight the consumer. This is why today 200,000 women in France are keen to pay 16.90 euros each month without knowing exactly what they are going to receive in return. It is this constantly renewed pleasure that allows us to build customer loyalty and make them want to browse through our online platform. Premium Beauty News - You are also diversifying your offer, with the opening of a wellness area and limited edition boxes or collaborations. Quentin Reygrobellet - Diversification is a major pillar of our growth strategy. In the retailing sector, innovation is very much a matter of selecting brands and we are fortunate to be in a period where many new offers are emerging. We have done a lot of innovation in our formats, with themed boxes and limited editions (lingerie, post-partum, etc.), an advent calendar at an unbeatable price, and partnerships with brands and designers from other sectors. By expanding our offer to the wellness sector, we have remained true to our philosophy of discovery, with a large number of entries - CBD, intimate pleasure, mothers-to-be - with a didactic approach, lots of advice and specific brands. These corners dedicated to discovery are an important element for recruiting new customers. We help them discover new products and new brands, at reasonable prices, by being ""niche"" without being unaffordable. Premium Beauty News - Was it the same logic that led you to open a creative studio to launch your own brands? Quentin Reygrobellet - Beauty Story, our creative studio, is a fully-fledged start-up within Blissim, with a dedicated team. The idea was to leverage the knowledge we have of our customers’ expectations, thanks to the data we have, to meet their wants even better. Even if we don’t deny ourselves anything, the idea was not to create a retail brand, but to serve market segments that were not sufficiently taken into account. The Imparfaite brand thus celebrates the uniqueness and originality of all women. It is also available at Monoprix and Nocibé. In the make-up sector, Yolaine has several successful products, notably Mousse de Rouge, which is a hit in the United States and Japan. We are going to launch a mascara and a liner based on the data collected via a direct link between our data warehouse and our market analysis tool. Premium Beauty News - You announced the launch of your German business last March: what is your first assessment of this experience? Quentin Reygrobellet - Our entry into the German market is still very recent. It’s a bit too early to say how we are doing. We are quite happy with our debut in this mature market where competition in the box market is not strong but where there are already well-established e-commerce players. We are going to create ephemeral pop-up stores in four cities (Cologne, Hamburg, Düsseldorf, and Karlsruhe) in partnership with Pick & Kopenburg, a department store that does not have a beauty department and has chosen us as a partner in this sector. In Germany as in France, we rely on the pillars of Blissim’s success: we are the only player in Europe allowing people to discover beauty, trigger surprise, and guidance, with personalised offers based on a thorough knowledge of our customers. Premium Beauty News - What are the next steps? Quentin Reygrobellet - We are going to open our e-commerce site in Germany in 2023, relying on a logistic organization specially designed to be able to rapidly scale up and facilitate our entry into the other countries we are interested in: Italy, Spain, and Scandinavia... Our first steps in Germany are encouraging us to speed up our expansion. We noticed that several brands with which we have been working for some time, but which are not yet present in this country, are eagerly awaited. Our ambition is to carry on as we have always done: to grow by continuing to bring added value to our customers, while remaining profitable and in control of our destiny."
Cosnova’s accessible price strategy is attracting more and more people,"Premium Beauty News - How do you explain the success of the Catrice and Essence brands, particularly in a market as difficult as France? Soazig Le Prince - In the current hyper inflationary context, consumers are making budget decisions that impact the way they buy and select products. Catrice and Essence are the main beneficiaries, because today no other brand is able to offer such a premium quality for less than five euros. As far as retailers are concerned, the two brands generate traffic and loyalty: this is what explains our remarkable performance and our tremendous growth in France and around the world. The entry of Catrice and Essence on the online boutique of French beauty retailer Nocibe for a year now has been a real boost in sales but also in visibility. Very good progress is underway month after month and the end of the year promises to be excellent, thanks in to our Disney make-up collections for Halloween, closely followed by our special Christmas references (palettes, boxes, etc.) that are pretty gifts at low prices. When you’re a foreign brand, it’s difficult to enter the French market, in particular with the very strong presence of L’Oréal in all the distribution networks and in particular ours, the mass distribution, but our strategy has enabled us to fit in this difficult marketplace. There is no magic in what we do. Our common thread is to manufacture make-up at unbeatable prices without compromising on quality. To do this, we rely on the synergy between our two make-up brands and our volumes. This economic model allows us to meet the expectations of the greatest number. Premium Beauty News - Each year, 50% of the range of each of the two brands is renewed. An impressive figure! Soazig Le Prince - Indeed, it is one of the strengths of the group. The Cosnova teams are developing new products very quickly for the two brands to reflect latest trends and consumer expectations in real time. This allows us to be highly competitive, but also to continually develop our new formulas so that they are as clean as possible without compromising on product performance. We have developed a non-exhaustive list of controversial substances that are banned from our products. In 2019, the Cosnova group also created its own in-house incubator dedicated to fostering beauty innovations. Currently, the teams are working on two projects simultaneously: Inao by Essence and La Manufacture. The incubator aims to imagine new categories of products that are tested under the name of an already existing brand, as is the case with Ino, a line of food supplements tested on the market German under the Essence brand. However, it can also develop its own brands, such as La Manufacture. It is a B to C project that combines customization and do it yourself makeup focusing on the complexion and marketed through a dedicated website: www.la-manufacture.shop. Premium Beauty News - The Catrice and Essence brands are both listed PETA International and Essence has been 100% vegan for a year. Soazig Le Prince - Since the creation of the group, its founder Christina Oster-Daum has been uncompromising on this point: no ingredients tested on animals will be used in the formulations. We made this choice even before the definitive ban on these tests in the European Union. To go even further in this cruelty free policy, Essence became 100% vegan a year ago and Catrice will also be completely vegan in February 2023. The Cosnova group has also created its own Clean Beauty seal, which prohibits controversial ingredients - such as PEGs, parabens and volatile silicones... - and ingredients of animal origin and which promotes simplified formulas. Finally, Cosnova has set itself the goal of using 30% less packaging by 2025, making 75% recyclable and using 50% recycled materials in its production. Result: 300 tons of virgin plastic were saved in 2021 compared to the previous year."
Cosmecode provides ideal foundation shade in one click,"Initially, the entrepreneur aimed to provide brands and distributors with an online and offline personalized advice solution thanks to digital technologies. “Personalized advice is the most powerful conversion tool in the beauty industry,” she says. “When a client gets the help of a Beauty Advisor in a store, it is very likely that she will leave with the product suggested. So, the idea was to develop a digital version of this.” The tool’s main feature is the help it provides when it comes to choosing the right foundation shade. “We extensively tested consumers’ reactions to digital advice and identified a great opportunity. It is a real challenge with all the existing skin tones. It is almost impossible to do online, and it is tricky in stores, where the bright environment should be taken into account”, she explains. With Cosmecode, the right shade recommendation is made by an algorithm. The process is quick and easy-to-use. The user takes a picture of herself, then the application shows the corresponding shade in the different brand ranges referenced in the database. Right now, the mobile app contains 6,500 foundation shades taken from the ranges the most widely available on the market (Chanel, BlackUp, Guerlain, etc.). “In the long run, we aim to reference all the products available on the market, with permanent updates. But our solution can also perfectly adapt to a brand and its references”, says Mellouki. Showcased at the last VivaTech show, the Cosmecode prototype boasted a reliability score of 94%, according to the test performed on a selection of three ranges. According to Mellouki, the process is based on the Computer Vision and Deep Learning technologies, but also on huge referencing work. “This tool is very hard to develop, but it has a tremendous potential. We have started with foundation, but we can also switch to other product categories later, like colours complementary to the complexion, for example, with lipsticks and hair colour”, she adds. Supported by a team of five developers, the company Director highlights her tool’s power as part of a B2B approach. Beyond the general public, she targets both distributors and brands with personalized interfaces adapted to any communication world. “In stores, brands can reference their products on the platform, which will be used as an advisory tool. This way, they can boost their conversion rates, but also provide advice of harmonized quality, a key element for them. Also, we are developing an online version with a plug-in to be integrated to e-commerce websites, so users can get their own shade recommendation before placing an order”, explains Mellouki. Last, but not least, the Cosmecode solution can very easily go global."
Armani Beauty partners with Fortnite to bring fragrances in the metaverse,"A field of all possibilities, the metaverse now allows people to buy virtual fashion and accessories, to see exhibitions or to attend concerts. But these new worlds at the frontier of reality are above all favored by brands seeking to gain visibility among their prime target, Generation Z, which masters these worlds like no other — even if only a minority have actually set foot in them. As a result, some brands have decided to go big, pulling out all the stops to stage initiatives in places where consumers are actually present — i.e., in the world of gaming, a form of metaverse that is enjoyed by billions of people around the world. Armani Beauty has now partnered with one of the most popular games, ""Fortnite,"" to promote its new men’s fragrance, Code. Evidently, it’s not a question of testing the new fragrance online, which is impossible for now. Here, it’s about encouraging users to take part in an immersive experience called ""Rewrite the Code"" as a means of discovering the scent — in turn making as many people as possible want to try it — and buy it. In fact, it is above all a fairly classic online game, which put the recent launch at centre stage. ""In a world where time flows backwards, players race through maze-like speed runs to collect the numbers needed to unlock the Armani Code building and the Armani Code Parfum bottle, in order to harness its magnetic power to put the world forwards again,"" explains the brand on its Instagram account. Through this game, players have the opportunity to get acquainted with the bottle, the ingredients, and especially the scent’s wider universe. Creating their own world, or a themed space in the metaverse allows brands to present their new products, while also building customer loyalty, and even creating a community. Brands like Balenciaga, Gucci, Hermès and Dior — among others — have understood this perfectly, and have all jumped into the world of gaming and, even more broadly, into these new virtual worlds. Indeed, these brands already have strong communities, and the metaverse can offer them many new possibilities."
Aroma-Zone opens a new store in Paris and prepares to grow abroad,"The French brand, which specializes in aromatherapy, natural and do it yourself beauty, has opened a 180 m2 store at the Forum des Halles in Paris, France. On this occasion, Aroma-Zone is launching a new concept, designed to facilitate the customer’s journey and the discovery of the brand’s three main families: Beauty, Health & Well-Being and Home. This is the tenth boutique of the brand in France (after Lyon, Montpellier, Toulouse, Marseille, Aix-en-Provence, Lille, et Strasbourg), and the third in Paris, after those of the Odéon district and Boulevard Haussmann ""We were looking for a location that would be easily accessible from the entire Paris region, because our customers sometimes come from very far away to find our products,"" explains Sabrina Herlory, CEO of Aroma-Zone, to Premium Beauty News. With more than 2,300 references of natural products, the shop gives access to the Aroma-Zone team of natural beauty advisers, to freely accessible digital tablets that enable consumers to consult the brand’s recipes for making their own cosmetics, QR codes placed on all the products and giving access to their details on the Aroma-Zone website, as well as two bulk bars — a liquid soap bar and a vegetable oil bar. The opening of this new Parisian location comes with the launch of several new products: a CBD oil titrated at 12% and the brand’s first food supplements in the form of eight 100% natural and organic superfoods powders (alfalfa, baobab, chlorella, turmeric, ginkgo biloba, Brazilian ginseng, guarana, matcha) and Curcumin and Spirulina tablets. While they currently only operates in France, Aroma-Zone is resolutely preparing its internationalization and will open a new store on October 20 in Brussels, Belgium. “There is a strong international demand for our natural, simple and affordable products. Although it is only written in French, 15% of orders on our online store already come from abroad”, emphasises Sabrina Herlory. This first foray outside France will be followed by an opening in Italy. Switzerland and Spain are expected to follow in 2023."
"“Cosmetic 360 offers a unique vision of cosmetics”, Frankie Béchereau","Premium Beauty News - What do you expect of this eighth edition? Frankie Béchereau - Once again, we will offer a unique vision of the future of the cosmetics industry. Cosmetic 360 is definitely a show like no other: it is neither a packaging show nor an ingredient show. It is not a “trade show”, but a “vision event”. It is a place where you can meet people and companies you don’t see anywhere else. This year, logistics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be in the spotlight: if these fields are not specific to cosmetics, they are key aspects of our sector. Cosmetic 360 is the place par excellence for cross-fertilisation: many of these start-ups, SMEs, and French and global laboratories only attend this show. After two years of pandemic, the event is extremely promising, as it will host 200 exhibitors. Compared to the 220 participants in 2019, a few Asian companies are missing, in particular Chinese and Japanese ones. But the show will still count 20% of global exhibitors from other European countries, plus from the US and a few Asian countries. In line with our mission, there will be raw material suppliers, testing companies, packaging and service suppliers (logistics, IT support, consulting), and brands. As for visitors, pre-registrations are also going very well – the number of international visitors is pretty high. Premium Beauty News - Will there also be a digital version of the event? Frankie Béchereau - We aim to capitalize on our digital experience, while enjoying the opportunity to meet people physically. In 2020, we had organized a 100% digital event, and in 2021, the show was hybrid: you could plan digital meetings. This year, we designed our own digital platform, which will be available at the end of September, as a tool to prepare and intensify the physical show. It will help companies organize their meetings beforehand and during the event. However, although there will be some content on the platform, we have preferred to organize physical conferences. Premium Beauty News - Why did you choose to put technological revolutions, in particular AI, at the core of this edition? Frankie Béchereau - Technologies are very strongly related to competitiveness: AI, data, algorithms, and virtual innovations will transform cosmetic trades. Many resources are available in France and we wanted to have several exhibitors in this sector as a complement to our conference programme, which will deal with many aspects of it. Several animations will also be dedicated to this theme. An AI animation area with about ten specialized companies was designed in collaboration with Choose Paris Region and Région Île-de-France. At the AI TechCorner, a laboratory of CNRS, the French national centre for scientific research, will introduce a skin diagnosis tool to develop personalized products. This brand new skin imagery technology is combined with skin analysis software. The prototype has not yet been industrialized. And for its 30th anniversary, Greentech will offer visitors to experientially discover how they model new molecules thanks to AI. Premium Beauty News - This year, the traditional Hackathon will actually be dedicated to AI’s added value for the supply chain and logistics. Frankie Béchereau - The supply chain is one of the many fields where AI can be used and we are very happy to highlight this theme with our sponsor, the Deret Group, at a time when supplies are under tension. It also echoes the LIPACO Seine research project (LIPACO stands for Intelligent Logistics for the Perfumes & Cosmetics Industry) in which the Cosmetic Valley took part. The Deret Group will suggest subjects to multidisciplinary teams of students from different schools (engineers, packaging experts, cosmeticians, etc.). The delivery will take place at the end of the show, on October 13, around 5pm. Premium Beauty News - Open Innovation is still at the core of the show. How will this event be organized this year? Frankie Béchereau - It follows the same logic: we detect international companies with innovative projects, and then we organize interviews during the show with the companies which subscribed to this service, including Chanel, L’Oréal, LVMH Research, and Pharma & Beauty Group. This year, for this programme, we put an emphasis on digital innovations and the value brought by AI. Premium Beauty News - The Cosmetic 360 Week will take place in parallel to the show. What is it exactly? Frankie Béchereau - It is a meeting programme mainly reserved for global players which starts before the show and ends after. It is a whole cosmetics-oriented week which covers the show’s two days, so people can discover laboratories, factories, training centres, and retailers before and after the show. This programme is part of our project to make Cosmetic 360 a specific event dedicated to all aspects of the 21st century cosmetics industry, but also to French excellence in this field."
Superga Beauty invests to adapt its Cosmeurop plant to full service,"The “Beauty” division of the Superga Invest group now has 6 industrial sites in France and 500 employees in France, Europe and Asia. The activity is divided into three business units: Subcontracting (filling, packaging, copacking, picking), Full Service, Promotion & Retail. For several years, the company has been investing massively in its production tool to become a privileged industrial partner of beauty and luxury brands. Between 2019 and 2021, 20 million euros were injected into the extension of the perfume division and the modernization and automation of its various sites. “Our ambition is to operate sites that in all aspects (quality, safety, HSE, etc.) are as efficient as those of the brands, so that they can be fully confident in our ability to address their needs. We want to support all brands, from the smallest to the largest, thanks to a complementary offer and great agility on all of our production sites,” explains Leslie Bréau-Méniger, President of Superga Beauty. The take-over in 2021 of the Cosmeurop site from L’Oréal enabled Superga Beauty to acquire a world-class factory, a historic flagship of French perfumery dedicated to the manufacture of Mugler and Azzaro perfumes. Although the L’Oréal group has undertaken to remain a partner of the site for a minimum period of 3 years, Superga Beauty has immediately initiated its industrial and commercial transformation to adapt it to the needs of full-service customers. With 129 underground tanks, from 1,000 to 10,000 litres, a storage capacity of 744,000 litres of alcohol, and 11 packaging lines, including 4 automatic lines, Cosmeurop can produce 3 million litres of perfume per year and fill-in 20 to 25 million vials. The manufacturing unit is fully computer-assisted for total precision in the weighing, premixing, colouring and filtration stages. All perfume storage tanks are buried and connected to the conditioning room by almost 9 km of pipes, so that the perfumes never come into contact with the air. The plant offers a level of technicity and production capacities that are hardly seen in perfume subcontracting, and which have already won over big names. “These unique installations guarantee exceptional reliability and quality. All the perfumes produced on site are directly connected to the packaging lines”, emphasizes Anne-Sophie Motelle, Managing Director of Cosmeurop. Sized to respond to large-scale projects, the Cosmeurop site supplements the filling and packaging capacities of the other Superga Beauty units, in particular the BPS Fragrances site, in Northern France, which has a maceration unit and 8 perfume filling lines. Thanks to its various sites, Superga Beauty is able to process small, medium and large series. For Superga, however, the challenge was to make Cosmeurop gain in flexibility. Thus, most of the investments were aimed at transforming the site into an agile unit capable of satisfying the multiple full-service expectations of a wide variety of brands. The different sizes of the maceration tanks, the variety of packaging lines (automatic, semi-automatic and manual), thus make it possible to meet diversified needs, for minimum order quantities of 5,000 or 10,000 pieces. Below this, the group’s other sites take over. Cosmeurop, which also has historical expertise and the appropriate tools for packaging refillable bottles fitted with screw-on rings, will also soon have a robotic line dedicated to small format bottles (10, 20 or 30 ml ). Enough to satisfy the two strongest trends of the moment! A new in-house quality control laboratory is now available to conduct all tests and analyses brands require on finished products. Finally, a storage capacity of 17,000 pallets makes it possible to anticipate certain logistical needs of full service customers. With Cosmeurop, Superga Beauty now has capacities capable of integrating into the industrial strategy of the largest groups, but also to address the needs of national and international players of all sizes who want made in France products. “Capacity, expertise and agility are the main strengths we put at disposal of all kinds of brands,” concludes Anne-Sophie Motelle."
Perfumes: Matière Première cultivates traditional French know-how in Grasse,"Founded in 2019 by Aurélien Guichard and two associates – Caïus Von Knorring, former Marketing Director of Valentino at Puig, and Cédric Meiffret, former Development Group Director at Dior, IFF and Givaudan – Matière Première is now enjoying a leading position in the niche perfumery world, with almost ten launches in three years. They owe their success to concise, easily readable formulas that beautify a flagship ingredient, driven by a persistent, wrapping trail. A master-perfumer at Takasago, Aurélien Guichard was raised in the Grasse region: during his childhood, he was immersed in the world of raw materials. His father, perfumer Jean Guichard, had some land in Grasse, where his grandparents cultivated flowers. He decided to preserve the family know-how by purchasing his own fields, next to his property. He became a farmer in 2016. Three years later, he harvested his first roses. After Rose de Mai, Aurélien Guichard chose to plant tuberoses - he has one hectare of those today. Initially meant to cultivate the traditional know-how of the Grasse region, these plantations led him and his two accomplices to consider creating Matière Première: a first for a niche brand, since rose cultures in Grasse are mainly intended for Chanel and LVMH brands (Louis Vuitton, Dior, Guerlain). His rose and tuberose productions are reserved for the brand’s two iconic fragrances: Radical Rose and French Flower. A real asset for the brand, these fields offer unequalled authenticity in the niche perfume world, given the unique, exceptional personality and quality of Grasse flowers. Indeed, perfume brands have a taste for the tuberose of India, whose production is much more important and which costs about 11,000 euros per kilo of absolute. Much less than its cousin from Grasse, since the organic tuberose absolute obtained from Aurélien Guichard’s fields, less fruity and less marked by an indole smell, costs about 250,000 euros per kilo. Once the flowers have been harvested, composition company Robertet carries out both the volatile solvent extraction to create the absolute, and the enfleurage with plant-derived waxes to obtain the “absolute pomade”. About three tonnes of flowers are needed to get one kilo of absolute and 30 to 50 kilos of flowers are required for one kilo of enfleurage. The tuberose is a flower with a complex perfume which is harvested from August to November. During the day, it is mellow, solar, and velvety – a facet highlighted by enfleurage. At night, its perfume gets more luxurious, as it exhales methyl, camphorated tones with almost leathery notes for a pretty faithful result as an absolute. French Flower plays with the flower’s two facets, since it is composed of absolute and absolute pomade to fully render the smell of a field of tuberoses. By exploiting its own fields of flowers, the brand gains flexibility: it can adapt production to its needs, as can be seen with the Rose Centifolia, which occupies a two-hectare field. Aurélien Guichard is now considering planting lavandin on his land. If it is rare for a niche brand to have its own fields of flowers, made-in-Grasse production increasingly seduces perfume companies in search of authenticity, traditional know-how, and localism. A flourishing business in the 1930s, flower culture gradually declined in the Grasse region during the 20th century. Then, in the 1980s, the partnerships concluded with local producers by Chanel, and Dior or Lancôme, a bit later, gave it a new shine. In addition, a wind of change is blowing on the region and its exceptional products, thanks to the Grasse perfume know-how being added to UNESCO’s World Heritage list in 2018, and to the collective brand Grasse Expertise intended for local aroma-perfume-flavour-scent professionals."
Home fragrances: Scentys is investing and innovating to meet demand,"Since its creation in 2004, Scentys has been offering brands (75% of its turnover) an exclusive technology for diffusing perfumes in the air. The concentrate comes in a solid format, in the form of small pearls, and the fragrance is released thanks to an airflow system. This proprietary technology is also offered to shops, offices or hotels to enhance the olfactory identity of the premises. Finally, for in-store testing, the company offers alternative solutions to test bottles, in the form of mechanical olfactory keys: filled with perfumed capsules developed by the company, they ensure a perfect and very accurate reproduction (always validated by the brands) for about two months, with no necessary maintenance. Driven by the dynamism of the home fragrance market, Scentys is now targeting a turnover of 20 to 25 million euros within 5 years, compared to 6 million euros in 2021. In March, the company opened a sales office in New York to better serve a very dynamic North American market. It is also counting on the growing interest of Asia, particularly China, in creating pleasant olfactory atmospheres in homes, offices or cars. ""The home fragrance market has been growing at a steady pace for several years. Its growth has been accelerated by the various confinements, which have prompted people to attach great importance to the comfort of their homes and, more generally, to their well-being,"" explains Pierre Loustric, CEO. Anticipating the increase in its activity, Scentys has invested nearly one million euros in a new industrial site. On 1 July, the company commissioned its new production unit in Saint-Ouen L’Aumône, in the greater Paris area, in a 3,000 m2 site (against 600 m2 for the previous one), benefiting from the BREEAM environmental label. Equipped with new machines, the site is ready to meet the demands of clients who are increasingly interested in a full-service offer, including not only the filling of scented capsules but also their packaging. A Quality Manager position has been created to supervise all the processes and guarantee optimal customer service. A FabLab with rapid prototyping machines has also been integrated. It should allow development teams to move more quickly from the customer’s concept to the industrial prototype, and thus help considerably reduce the development time before launch. At the same time, Scentys has revamped its visual identity with a new logo, a new baseline (""Excellence in fragrance diffusion"") and a new website. Thanks to a technology that uses very little perfume concentrate and ultra-light products with a diffusion time equivalent to that of a candle, Scentys has long claimed a reduced environmental impact. Especially since its dry technology does not emit VOCs and therefore offers a particularly safe perfuming. To take things a step further, the EcoVadis Silver certified company has expanded its offer cartridges with a recycled PP option. The cartridges can also be recycled in the normal flow of plastic packaging. Scentys is carrying out further research and is currently evaluating various alternative materials. ""Our very light cartridges (24g) are perfectly suited to e-commerce and have a very low carbon footprint compared to candles, for example. But we are continuing our efforts to find ever more ecological solutions,"" insists Pierre Loustric. Scentys has recently developed a connected and intelligent diffuser, which can interact with voice assistants (Alexa type). A customisable turnkey solution for a brand wishing to develop a new relationship with its customers. ""We are an engineering company with a very marked technical culture. We see innovation as an important vector for growth, but innovation is not just about high-tech, it is also about regular advances in the use of more sustainable materials and reducing our environmental footprint,"" concludes the CEO."
JCPenney partners with Revieve to offer digital makeup and skincare experiences,"The U.S. retailer has partnered with digital brand experience company Revieve to launch new digital tools to enhance shopping experiences for makeup and skincare on their online store. The new tools includes an AI-powered skincare advisor and a hyper realistic AR-powered makeup try-on technology. ""We want to be the shopping destination of choice, offering a personalized approach that fully celebrates and honors them as unique individuals,"" says Michelle Wlazlo, Chief Merchandising Officer at JCPenney. “Our partnership with Revieve allows us to deliver on our customers’ desire for personalization regardless of age, gender, race, skin tone, beauty regimen, or budget.” JCPenney’s Skincare Advisor leverages Revieve’s proprietary Skin Diagnostics technology and AI-powered product recommendations as a seamless, end-to-end experience in which consumers can find a personalized skincare routine with a simple selfie. To receive an in-depth skincare analysis and customized product recommendations, visitors to JCPenney’s website can take or upload a selfie and answer a quick questionnaire about their skin type and concerns. Revieve’s proprietary Skin Diagnostics technology then analyzes more than 120 skin metrics to provide users with an in-depth analysis of their skin and offer JCPenney Beauty product recommendations and skincare education tailored to their needs. According to Sampo Parkkinen, CEO and Founder of Revieve, JCPenney is “one of the only department chains in the US to bet on personalization.” The simultaneous launch of these new digital experiences will help “JCPenney customers in finding the right makeup products and skincare routine tailored to their skin type and preferences,” he added. The introduction of these new personalized digital beauty experiences follows the launch of JCPenney Beauty, the retailer’s new, fully inclusive beauty experience, last year. Initially launched at 10 JCPenney store locations across the USA and on jcp.com in October 2021, JCPenney Beauty features an assortment of 170+ beauty brands - from tried-and-true favorites to fresh indie finds to BIPOC founded - spanning makeup, skincare, haircare, styling tools, fragrance, nailcare, and bath and body products at varying price points. Based on extensive consumer research, the retailer has created a blend of products within the mass, masstige (accounting for nearly a half of the assortment), and prestige range for customers."

Capsum opens a lab farm at its research centre using iFarm technology,"Capsum will now be able to cultivate its own organic ingredients for new cosmetic formulas. The French designer and manufacturer of microfluidic skin care formulas has partnered with Finnish technology development company iFarm, which specializes in IT-driven technologies to grow plant in a controlled environment. iFarm has created a cutting-edge farm-laboratory within the Capsum’s existing Research & Development site at its Marseille plant. The pilot laboratory consists of three growing rooms with experimental racks based on Ebb-and-Flow hydroponics technology and an automation control system piloted by iFarm’s Growtune software. This set-up allows Capsum to grow a range of crops, including microgreens and flowers, and to conduct experiments, test new plant varieties and streamline its supply chain with pesticide-free cosmetics ingredients being grown on-site. “Indoor growing is perfect for the beauty industry, as it allows us to cultivate in a fully controlled environment free from pesticides and any harmful chemicals. iFarm’s technology fits the needs of our researchers, since they are able to vary a wide range of parameters,” said CEO of Capsum Anthony Briot. Capsum’s is currently researching innovative extraction methods and the iFarm technology will provide its R&D team all the needed to complete long and intricate research processes and to produce the botanicals required to develop innovative formulas. However, iFarm’s vice-president of sales, Timo Koljonen, outlined that the potential benefits of indoor farming for cosmetic companies go beyond the laboratory setting. “With iFarm, clients can start with an R&D project and then scale it up to industrial production of herbs, flowers and microgreens, with full hardware and software support along the way. A crop that is stable and predictable year-round, as well as guaranteed to be free from any potential contamination by pesticides or other harmful chemicals, would be also beneficial for larger production volumes,” he emphasized."
"“We need to expand our global reach,” says Gotha CEO, Paolo Valsecchi","Premium Beauty News - How do you prepare for the future as make-up is recovering rapidly? Paolo Valsecchi - As far as the pleasure of wearing make-up is concerned, consumers are back to their pre-pandemic habits! Sales of colour cosmetics are therefore growing around the world, in particular in North America. At the Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna and MakeUp in Paris trade shows, we celebrated this return to the pleasure of make-up with a collection named “Seeking Joy”. As consumers are looking for fun and playfulness in all areas of life, we think emotional plurality will be a defining feature of 2020’s. However, that does not mean the market did not transform compared to the pre-Covid era! The rise of online sales, the growing influence of social media and the search for more natural and sustainable products are some illustrations of the big shifts of the market. Premium Beauty News - What are the consequences for Gotha Cosmetics? Paolo Valsecchi - I think we need to invent something new! The growing role of social media, for instance, has changed the game. Brands need to accelerate new products developments and to reduce time to market. From an industrial point of view, this means that we need to be closer to our customers, closer to end markets. In clear, we need to expand our global footprint with bigger capabilities in Europe, Asia and North America. In addition to expand geographically, we might also find interest in adding new product categories to our portfolio. Our recent acquisition of iColor Group in China will help us to better serve medium local brands interested in offering premium products with competitive prices. More recently, we acquired Mia Cosmetic Factory, a filling company specialising in colour cosmetics based in Ripalta Cremasca, near Crema, Italy, The company was already partnering with us for the filling of a variety of products such as foundations, mascaras, brow products, glosses and highlighters, among others. The operation will enable Gotha to develop new projects faster. Premium Beauty News - What are the next steps? Paolo Valsecchi - We are looking for new opportunities, in particular in North America. Also, we want to add more categories to our portfolio in Italy. Eyes and lips would be interesting areas of growth for us! On September 14 and 15, we will present our latest innovations to the North American market at the Equinox Hotel in the Hudson Yards district, in New York."
J -7: “MCB by Beauté Sélection 2022 will be very dynamic!”,"Premium Beauty News - What should we expect for the 2022 edition of MCB by Beauté? Christophe Gabreau - After two years of pandemic, the 2022 MCB by Beauté Sélection show gives a sense of renewal. Beauty and hairdressing players are back: we are expecting a high number of brands and visitors and we have prepared a rich content, with a very comprehensive conference and events programme. Just over 270 exhibitors are confirmed, including many newcomers from Europe, but also from other continents! It just shows how much beauty and hairdressing players need – and want – to go meet the public, exchange, and make themselves known! Premium Beauty News - At your last press conference last July, you announced you were expecting 45% of global exhibitors. Have they confirmed? Christophe Gabreau - They have! We will have 45% of global exhibitors, with Brazil ahead, closely followed by Italy. More than 25 Brazilian brands will attend, mainly in the hair care category – a very dynamic segment in this country! We will also have Japanese, Chinese, and Korean brands. As far as Europe is concerned, Spain will be better represented than the previous years. Premium Beauty News - This year, you decided to dedicate a whole area to eyes and nails. Why? Christophe Gabreau - This area reflects an undeniably major “consumption” trend: final customers’ interest in comprehensive beauty places. Consumers like it when they can have different aesthetic services in the same place (hairdressing, coloration, manicure, makeup, skin treatments…): it is really time-saving. Professionals know that now, so many of them have diversified their businesses to provide complementary services. Claude Maxime and Dessanges, for example, do not introduce themselves as hair salons, but as beauty salons, although their core business is hairdressing. We will host more than thirty brands in this area, so there will be both products and equipment: Magnetic Nail Design, Peggy Sage, Lash Master, Fraise Nail Shop, Make-up For Ever, Erlinda, and many others! Premium Beauty News - For the first time, the 2022 edition of MCB by Beauté Sélection will host the global Eyelash & Nail competition in partnership with the Nail Art France association. Christophe Gabreau - The competition will last three days, and the awards ceremony will take place on the Monday, in the eye and nail area. Two stages will be built for it. This competition makes us even more unmissable as a specialized hairdressing and aesthetics show. We are expecting about 250 candidates from all over the world! Premium Beauty News - The show’s three days will be marked by many conferences and events. What themes will be highlighted?  Christophe Gabreau - We wanted to focus on two main subjects for which the industry’s upstream players (R&D, engineering departments, manufacturers…) and downstream players (hairdressers, makeup artists, beauticians…) try to understand the changes, future trends, and consumer expectations. These two themes are committed beauty and digital technologies. Over the show’s three days, the speakers will share their thoughts and experiences with visitors to provide them with concrete solutions. The programme is real exciting [editor’s note: link to the programme at the end of the interview]! Premium Beauty News - The show will start in just a few days. How many visitors are you expecting? Christophe Gabreau - We have exceeded our expectations: the number of visitors increases every day, and we should have even more than the 50,000 we had during the 2019 MCB by Beauté Sélection !

Made in Italy: TTC a new powder player in the Cosmetic Valley,"Since 2008, TTC (Tutti Trucchi Cosmetici) has focused on handling fabrication and assembly of beauty products for brands around the world. TTC seized the opportunity to push its limits and grow into a truly innovative hub of services by providing packaging, filling & assembly, as well as formulation and production of new products. TTC is located in the “Cosmetic Valley” in Italy, and the geographic position of the company has been strategically important in building new business. In 2020 TTC added an internal branch that is fully dedicated to powders. Along with a brand-new state-of-the-art R&D lab, new product development, sales, and marketing teams are all focused on the mission of formulating, creating, and producing beautiful makeup powders. TTC is bringing fresh innovative concepts to the industry. The mission of the group is to invest energy and time to create a portfolio of products that showcase quality and innovation.  This focus has led to a library of over 2,200 newly created formula codes in just the last two years. The R&D team is fully dedicated to innovation, working every day to find ways to upgrade traditional powder categories for eyes, face, and body. The products coming out of this innovation hub are changing the rules of beauty. TTC’s new lab opened just before the outbreak of the pandemic (Jan. 2020) which necessitated an intense focus on innovation during a period when the market demand was low. This ultimately provided the opportunity to experiment with new technologies and new raw materials. “We are hyper focused on powders that provide a truly new skin experience from the first touch,” said Milena Casiraghi, Managing Director of TTC, “innovation means being unique in the market.” Playing with new raw materials is resulting in innovative products never seen before on the market. Casiraghi says, “we are really reinventing the pressed powders category thanks to the expertise of our R&D and marketing team - they have a very specific vision in terms of make-up, and they are trying to combine the best of traditional expertise with new raw materials and active ingredients to create innovative products for tomorrow.” TTC’s new machines are creating the best products. Their R&D team and industrialization experts are already involved in this new endeavor, and they are expanding their team this summer. The possibilities for innovation stem from both a visual perspective (multicolor pressed products), as well as from a sensorial/application perspective - new textures created with injection technology release a weightless, very shiny, and pearly effect that can’t be obtained with standard powders. TTC is growing! They have new colleagues on board in their Sales, NPD, R&D, and Regulatory departments; new people, new ideas, and new opportunities are the driving force behind their new endeavor where they are encouraging clients to visit them directly to explore new innovations and trends. The TTC showroom is becoming a real treasure that showcases their products and collections as well as demonstrates what the entire kdc/one network is able to offer. This showroom will be the largest stock packaging showroom in Europe. Customers can develop formulas in addition to brainstorming and shopping for packaging options at the same site.

Ankorstore breathes new life into independent brands and stores,"The co-founders, Pierre-Louis Lacoste, Nicolas d’Audiffret, Nicolas Cohen, and Mathieu Alengrin, all come from e-commerce. And yet, given the weight of online retail giants, they aimed to help independent points of sale reclaim their power with both technical and financial tools. The Ankorstore system is based on a new concept aimed to help 250,000 independent retailers in Europe, 40% of which are in France, get secure access to a catalogue of European brands in seven product categories (beauty, grocery, home, children’s products, fashion, jewellery, and stationery). For stores, the minimum order amount is set at 100 euros only – this deliberately low limit helps them test products and prevent overstock. Delivery is free: it triggers a payment to be made to the platform within up to 60 days to compensate for retailers’ cash flow issues. For the 20,000 brands already referenced in Europe, all categories included, Ankorstore offers instantaneous visibility online as part of its broad network. In addition, shipping costs are refunded and invoice payments automatically generated as soon as the delivery has been made to the store. “This way, brands are protected against non-payment risk,” explains Lily Cadell, Country Manager France. “They create their own catalogue on the website, so they can accept or refuse orders. They remain free to choose their own distribution strategy. Then, they ship the products, we pay them, and the store can pay us within 60 days. We definitely define ourselves as a marketplace which helps independent brands to boost their business and retailers to source their products from these brands,” she adds. A third of the 5,000 beauty brands selected are French. It is one of the three most dynamic categories in France for the platform, with a 65% growth of the number of brands since January. “Brands are selected according to simple criteria. We only work with brands which have stock, since we promise stores to be delivered within 10 to 15 days. Then, of course, come quality and margins: we cannot work with brands with low margins, it is not interesting for retailers. Generally speaking, we accept 50% of the brands that apply,” explains Lily Cadell. Endro, Jolis Baumes, Comme Avant, Respire, Les Petits Prodiges, Lamazuna… Clean Beauty brands enjoy a privileged position, but the offering still boasts eclectic profiles to stick to an exhaustive approach. The platform’s business model is based on a commission taken from the turnover achieved by brands: 20% for the first order placed by a store, 10% on restockings. However, there is no commission if the store is a historic client of the brand, i.e. if they worked together before Ankorstore. With a 1.75-billion-euro value, Ankorstore is part of the closed club of French unicorns. Early this year, the company raised 250 million euros to keep growing and assert its position as the first European marketplace to facilitate exchanges between independent retailers and brands. “We are more than a marketplace, because we aim to create a product that is truly integrated and easy-to-use on a daily basis for both stores and brands,” says Lily Cadell. To highlight this objective, the company created a new integrated entity, Ankorstart. Thanks to its network of experts, it helps guide retailers starting their businesses from the beginning up to three months after they have opened their shops. “Before, during, and after, we support them with brand selection, financing issues and cash flow flexibility, stock evaluation according to their own store, administration and legal procedures, etc.,” explains Lily Cadell. To further strengthen its position as a partner, the company will launch a new fulfilment offer in late 2022: brands no longer willing to take care of the deliveries will be able to store some of their goods in an Ankorstore warehouse and outsource logistics and deliveries to the platform. Right now, Ankorstore counts eight offices in Europe, in Paris, Lille, London, Amsterdam, Berlin, Stockholm, Barcelona, and Milan, representing 600 employees. “We evaluate the potential of independent stores in Europe at 1.5 million. Right now, we have 250,000: there is still a long way to go, so we are focusing on this. We also aim to enrich our catalogue of brands, in particular in the beauty category,” Lily Cadell concludes."
"BolognaFiere, Informa and PBA partner and announce new trade show in Miami","Beginning in January 2023, BolognaFiere, Informa Markets and PBA will combine their forces and their beauty industry knowledge to strengthen their positions in the U.S. market. As a part of the new joint venture, PBA, who currently organizes ISSE in Long Beach, California, will evolve the show to be a part of the Premiere Beauty expansion in Anaheim, California. Premiere Beauty also runs events in Columbus, Ohio, in Birmingham, Alabama, and in Orlando, Florida. PBA already partners with BolognaFiere on the Cosmoprof North America show, held in Las Vegas, which hosted over 1,100 exhibiting companies and welcomed over 32,000 visitors in its 2022 edition. While Cosmoprof North America and Premiere have different attendee value propositions, the three partners expect to leverage the power of the two brands in order to deliver more value to the beauty industry across the U.S. Beginning in 2024, BolognaFiere, PBA, and Informa Markets are willing to expand the Cosmoprof North America brand, bringing beauty industry professionals together in Miami, Florida, one of the highest growth markets in the U.S. The three organizations believe that this new show will also be well positioned to serve the Latin American market. Informa Markets, which is also partnering with BolognaFiere in the organization of Cosmoprof Asia, had tried to launch an event in Miami in 2020, but this project, initially rescheduled to 2021, had been suspended due to the pandemic. The joint venture will be led by Ed McNeill, Vice President of the Informa Markets, U.S. Beauty Portfolio, with Meredith Loza and Marco Labbate leading Marketing and Sales, respectively in cooperation with the Sales and Marketing teams of BolognaFiere Cosmoprof. ""The U.S. market is particularly in the spotlight today, given the current uncertainties in the Asian continent”, highlighted Gianpiero Calzolari, President of BolognaFiere Group."
"“Tomorrow’s beauty will be physical and digital,” says L’Oréal’s Camille Kroely","Does L’Oréal’s presence at VivaTech mean that beauty and technological innovation are now inseparable? Camille Kroely - Technological innovation is the ally of tomorrow’s beauty. At L’Oréal, we believe that innovation is at the intersection of science and technology, and that’s exactly what we’re presenting at VivaTech. Innovation is at the heart of our DNA... At the beginning with science, and today by bringing science and technology together to offer an augmented beauty. How can technology shape the future of beauty? Camille Kroely - Today’s technologies allow us to meet consumers’ needs at the click of a button. Throughout their beauty journey, our customers have access to services that provide them with precision, such as virtual makeup testing via artificial intelligence, as well as customized advice, such as Lancôme’s Shade Finder, which helps them find the right shade of foundation, or personalized skin diagnostics in store with Skin Screen and at home with E-youth Finder. These innovations allow customers to find their own tailored beauty routine with an unprecedented degree of precision. Technology offers unlimited possibilities for personalization. Among the innovations showcased at VivaTech is Yves Saint Laurent Beauty’s ""Scent-Sation"" which lets users find the fragrance that best expresses their emotions. Has personalization become essential to winning over consumers? Camille Kroely - Scent-Sation is a unique immersive experience that, through a connected headset, can evaluate consumers’ emotional responses to different families of scents in order to help them find the perfect fragrance. The need for personalization has always existed, and technology offers consumers a customized response, with unprecedented level of precision. The group’s brands are also making their first forays into the metaverse with NFTs and immersive experiences. Is this an inevitable next step? Camille Kroely - At L’Oréal, the metaverse is a unique field of exploration and innovation for fostering engagement with a new generation of consumers. The beauty of the future will be physical, digital and virtual. We are therefore approaching it with a ’test and learn’ approach to identify possibilities to enrich the consumer journey, which is constantly evolving, moving from an ’Online to Offline’ approach to an ’Online to Offline to On-Chain’ approach. What possibilities could the metaverse hold for the group’s luxury and consumer brands? Camille Kroely - The metaverse offers many opportunities. Among them is the possibility to engage communities and promote diversity. For example, the NYX Professional Makeup brand is supporting the next generation of artists by launching the first 3D beauty designers label to shape the beauty codes of tomorrow. As part of this launch, NYX partnered with People of Crypto Lab (POC) on The Sandbox platform and made available 8,430 NFT avatars representing diversity in all its forms. For its part, Yves Saint-Laurent launched 10,000 NFTs to unlock unique and personalized experiences and services in the YSL Beauty ecosystem. With SkinCeuticals Pro 1:1, L’Oréal offers personalized — and free — skin diagnostics to build a customized routine. Is the future of skincare also virtual? Camille Kroely - Knowing your skin’s needs and the most appropriate product routine is a very strong demand that has always existed. Today, thanks to new technologies, we allow consumers to access a certain level of advice and recommendations at the click of a button, wherever they are. At L’Oréal, we’re seeing an exponential demand for skincare that’s growing rapidly today. We must respond by combining beauty products and services to offer consumers the best possible experience. Will all these technological innovations also be deployed in physical stores? Camille Kroely - That’s the strength of what we’re presenting today: a fluid beauty journey that offers the best of our recommendations and diagnostics through in-store devices. Lancôme is using artificial intelligence to offer Skin Screen, an advanced skin analysis service, provided free of charge in-store by a brand beauty consultant. The service uses an innovative device that takes pictures of the face using tripolar light technology to provide the best high-resolution analysis. Skin Screen uses artificial intelligence to compare images with our Skin Aging Atlas database of more than 15,000 images, and pools more than 20 years of data and expertise in clinical trial evaluations to analyze 13 skin health parameters, including hydration, texture, UV damage and dark circles. Is technology also being used to support a more environmentally responsible approach to beauty? Camille Kroely - At L’Oréal, we have identified many revolutionary technologies for making beauty more environmentally responsible. The L’Oréal Water Saver offers a hair-washing experience that reduces water consumption by 61% compared to standard methods; this will represent billions of liters of water each year. Virtual makeup testing is also proving to be very effective for preserving the environment. When a consumer uses it, we see up to -17% in the return rates of our products because the customer was able to try them beforehand; which also allows us to reduce our carbon footprint. What beauty will look like at L’Oréal in 10 years’ time? Camille Kroely - In 10 years, beauty at L’Oréal will be ever more responsible, more inclusive, and at the intersection of science and technology."
Abortion decision backs US companies into a tight space,"""Today’s Scotus (Supreme Court of the United States) ruling puts women’s health in jeopardy, denies them their human rights, and threatens to dismantle the progress we’ve made toward gender equality in the workplace since Roe,"" said Yelp Chief Executive Jeremy Stoppelman on Twitter. ""Business leaders must speak out now and call on Congress to codify Roe into law."" The Supreme Court’s decision of June 24, 2022 to overturn the landmark 1973 ""Roe v. Wade"" ruling enshrining U.S. women’s right to an abortion, is expected to result in patchwork legal rights across the United States, with abortion legal in progressive states like California and New York and barred in more conservative states like Texas. However few other CEOs of large US companies joined Stoppelman in condemning the decision. More common were statements from companies announcing or reiterating intention to reimburse employees if they need to travel for an abortion. “We are expanding [the benefits of the ELC’s medical plan] to include the coverage of travel and lodging necessary to access reproductive healthcare options within the United States that may not be easily accessible or locally available to employees and their dependents enrolled in ELC’s medical plan,” said The Estée Lauder Companies in a statement. Similarly, luxury group LVMH said: “LVMH and our Maisons remain committed to providing equitable access to high-quality and affordable health care resources for all employees and their families, regardless of where they live in the United States. This includes expenses associated with travel to a different state for health care services.” Yelp and Airbnb were among the first companies to announce such benefits last September following a Texas law banning abortion after six weeks, or before many women know they are pregnant. Others, including Citigroup, Tesla and Amazon, had also announced the benefit in following months. More companies came forward after a draft version of last week’s abortion ruling was published in a press leak in May; this group included Starbucks, Levi Strauss and JPMorgan Chase. On Friday, Disney added its name to the list, assuring employees of access to reproductive care benefits ""no matter where they live,"" according to a memo reported by CNBC. In the personal care industry Johnson & Johnson, and Unilever have made similar moves. However, most large companies in the U.S. have avoided publicly discussing the topic, a dynamic that Wharton business school professor Maurice Schweitzer considers unsurprising. ""I think we’ll see more companies statements. But companies are facing a challenge. On the one hand, they want to be active, be involved, make a statement, lead on this issue, because particularly for some companies, their employees value this,"" Schweitzer said. ""But it’s a complicated issue, because the legal landscape will change,"" opening companies up to possible litigation, he added. Schweitzer pointed to Disney’s recent difficulties in Florida as a cautionary tale. The entertainment giant found itself between a rock and a hard place as Florida’s legislature advanced what critics have called the ""Don’t Say Gay"" law, which bans lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in elementary schools. After initially staying quiet on the proposal, Disney finally spoke out on the measure, enraging far right Republican Governor Ron DeSantis, who ultimately signed a second law specifically punishing Disney over the row by eliminating the company’s special status surrounding its Orlando theme park. Disney ""ended up frustrating employees by not speaking out early enough, but also incurring costs from a political fights."" Schweitzer noted that more companies have spoken out in recent years, such as Apple CEO Tim Cook on gay rights and Dick’s Sporting Goods on gun control, which on Friday announced that it will provide up to $4,000 for employees, their spouses or their dependents who have to travel for an abortion. But the procedure is ""more fraught"" than many issues, Schweitzer said. ""It’s easier for companies to try to be silent than to wade into it,"" he said. Actually, major companies usually stay apart from social and political conflicts, especially in a polarized time. They tend to be afraid of offending their customers and associating their brands with sensitive subjects. However, this changed recently as pressures do not only come from advocacy groups but have extended to younger consumers and employees expecting the brands the buy, or the companies they work for, to have clear positions on what they see as key public issues. A series of indie brands have well understood that commitment could be a way to stand out from the crowd and met success by placing “corporate activism” as the keystone of their business model. Keeping quiet is no longer an option, but speaking out can be risky: more than ever companies need to be clear about their own values and how their corporate mission is expressed!"
CTKCLIP & the digitalization of beauty creation,"Founded in 2001, CTK is a cosmetics platform company that provides turnkey product development services – tracing its roots all the way back to Taega Trade - a cosmetics packaging manufacturer established in 1979. We provide a comprehensive range of services from content creation, product design, formula, packaging, marketing, production, quality management, and logistics. Our numerous collaborations with global beauty powerhouses allowed us to stay ahead of the trends, shaping future beauty innovations. We work with OEM partners to provide the best solution for each brand’s unique concepts and identities. We match the best OEM manufacturer to each client’s needs rather than running our own factory, because operating an in-house factory would blindside us into focusing on promoting products we are equipped and specialized in. This bias also limits the opportunities that we could otherwise propose to the clients that best fit their needs. Breaking free from the limitations, our in-house R&D labs and creative teams can solely focus on developing and curating the best proposals for the clients. We are now digitalizing these services through CTKCLIP so that we can reach a wider audience without the constraints of time and space. CTKCLIP is an online beauty creation platform. This platform is designed with the goal of simplifying product creation by matching thousands of formulas, packaging, and raw materials sourced and curated by CTK matched to client’s needs, all within a few clicks. Drawing parallels to Expedia – the all-in-one travel platform that provides all information from flights to hotels and car rentals, CTKCLIP is a beauty platform where one can find everything needed for beauty creation. Beauty creation is now made easy, without the hassle of going through multiple stages of development. It makes comparing information and matching various product requirements simpler and faster. We work and collaborate with over 200+ partner factories and manufacturers, showcasing a wide range of the best and newest products in the industry, we then mix and match client’s desired ingredients, formulas, and packaging, putting together the best options for client’s review. With more than 20 years’ experience in the industry and rubbing shoulders with global beauty powerhouses, we have rich knowledge on industry’s standards, enabling us to offer tailored service to our clients. We also have our very own in-house cosmetic chemists’ team at our CTK INOLAB – who are all experts in their fields. They are always experimenting with the latest trends and ingredients developing them into formulas – that are globally compliant. These formulas are not just innovative and trendy but also adhere to the strictest global compliances and highest quality. We also support our OEM partners by sharing our know-hows and scientific feedbacks so we can put together the best for our clients. Same goes for packaging – we proudly house a team of experienced packaging engineers and designers who design and bring to life innovative packaging solutions with new, eco-friendly materials. We hold over 280 patents – including the bottoms-up stick - designed for stick formulations but effectively eliminating wastage with its sophisticated cup mechanism. It was recently nominated at Makeup in Paris for the Innovation & Trend (IT) award! Our subsidiary - CTK Bio Canada champions our R&D efforts in eco-friendly material development, with our latest development of biodegradable and compostable plastics materials. For now, CTKCLIP is a platform that offers our existing beauty turnkey services from product planning, through development online. We promptly curate and introduce the newest products in the market to meet the diverse needs and requirements of our clients. Moving forward, we have plans to expand our platform to allow our partners to directly upload their newest innovations onto CTKCLIP, so we can further fasten the turnover time for products updates and expand our collection of products. On top of that, it will allow us to truly become a platform where our OEM partners can interact with our brand clients directly. Apart from ODM, we also have plans on further expanding CTKCLIP beyond - to include fully integrated solutions for clients. To kickstart our expansion effort, we have partnered up with CTK subsidiaries that provides 3PL logistics services as well as OBM designing services and these services will be made available on CTKCLIP soon. Lastly, we also have plans on providing retailing solutions on CTKCLIP. We would like to facilitate B2B and B2C commerce; connecting partners, brands and clients across the globe with the ultimate goal of CTKCLIP growing into an all-rounded platform that provides a full complete range of services- right from the very initial stage of product development to the retailing end."
"""We are banking on disruptive innovations"", Laurent Dodet, P&B Group","Premium Beauty News - Can you give us a quick overview of the P&B Group? Laurent Dodet - Pharma & Beauty Group has six plants in France that provide development and production services to more than 200 customers operating in the cosmetics, medical devices, food supplements and pharmaceutical sectors. This tool is complemented by a partnership with Cetes Cosmetics, the industrial arm of the Oriflame Group, which gives us access to the production capabilities of its factories in Poland, Russia and India, when necessary, to serve our customers. The group has 700 employees and posted sales of 90 million euros in 2021. We are targeting the 120 million euros mark in 2022. But P&B is first and foremost an entrepreneurial adventure! After a two-decade career in the beauty and health sector, I wanted to acquire a company in difficulty in 2012 to develop a qualitative and innovative industrial offer for the beauty, pharmaceutical and food supplement markets. This first site had around twenty employees and a turnover of 800,000 euros. It was certainly a bit of a crazy challenge, but it was an exciting one too! We created the group by successively buying up companies in financial difficulty, some of which were on the verge of liquidation. We focused on sites with specific know-how and, above all, motivated people! Today, we have a diversified and very complementary industrial tool. Each site has a specific purpose, our units are very complementary but can also support each other for certain productions and offer our customers a reassuring backup possibility. Premium Beauty News - The world of cosmetic contract manufacturing is in strong development but also highly competitive. What are the assets of P&B Group today? Laurent Dodet - We do not consider ourselves as subcontractors but as designer-producers! Our priority is the quality of service provided to customers. We master a wide variety of production technologies for dosage forms (liquids, pastes, tablets, loose powders, hot poured solids, etc.). Our site in Montélimar, which is GMP Pharma certified, allows us to bridge the gap between the ""in & out"". We can condition a wide variety of packaging, ranging from the most standard to the most disruptive solutions such as pouch aerosols, sticks (skincare and make-up), powder sticks, aluminium tubes, DOY packs, etc. We have invested massively in human organisation, industrial infrastructures and innovation. For example, we have industrialised the production of preservative-free products based on CL TECH’s UHT technology. In total, we currently employ more than 40 people in cosmetic R&D and 6 people in food supplement R&D. In general, we focus on breakthrough innovations, in partnership with start-ups from the medical world or other sectors, in particular for the development of dermatological products or innovative medical devices, but also the implementation of new production processes. For example, we have done a lot of research on ionised water for healthcare and medical devices (e.g. nasal sprays). This research work will soon lead to a publication and numerous projects in cosmetics. Finally, we will be one of the four companies participating in the Open Innovation session of the Cosmetic 360 trade show which will take place on 12 and 13 October 2022 in Paris. We will be meeting the project leaders alongside leading cosmetics groups such as LVMH and Chanel. Premium Beauty News - What are your plans for the future? Laurent Dodet - Innovation is still at the heart of our strategy and we plan to continue supporting start-ups in their projects. We invest 6 to 7 million euros each year in new equipment and to improve our infrastructure. We are currently building 900 m² of offices in Saint-Chamas, near Aix-en-Provence, to bring together all our support services. On the same site, we plan to build a 1,000 m² building dedicated to our R&D. We also have a project to expand our sites in Montélimar and Saint-Chamas by 2023. We are also thinking about completing our formulation know-how through colour expertise, particularly in the area of tinting (hot poured and fluid): either by developing this expertise internally or through an acquisition. We also want to promote our know-how internationally, and we are structuring ourselves with this in mind. Premium Beauty News - What is your vision for the market in the coming years? How do you intend to meet future challenges? Laurent Dodet - Environmental and social issues will become increasingly important. Our carbon footprint will be finalized in July and this will allow us to identify areas for improvement and continue our actions. To combine sustainability and secure supplies, we are working to shorten our value chains so that we are no longer forced to source raw materials from the other side of the world, in particular through the vertical integration of certain resources. In the same vein, we are also working on traceability, particularly for Energie Fruit, one of our customers who has placed transparency at the heart of its project. Beyond that, I think that innovation will remain strategic. It requires commitment and patience, but our objective is to continue to grow while maintaining our agility and our sense of service."
ABC Texture aims to grow thanks to innovation and an eco-designed plant,"ABC Texture develops full-service cosmetic formulas and products in the skincare, makeup, and sun care categories. All formulas are based on the GREENette concept and contain at least 95% of ingredients of natural origin. They are also eligible to the Cosmos or Eve Vegan certificates. “Our formulas are always minimalist. All ingredients should have a function in the product,” says Louisette Bourdin, President of the company. ABC Texture combines these high degrees of naturalness with a great diversity of galenic forms. The formulas can be solid, hot-poured, emulsified and aqueous for production volumes from 50 kg to two tonnes. “We work with natural materials without any compromise on sensoriality, even if our products are highly technical or involve significant constraints, given the specifications. For example, we have products with a double function, like our solar foundation,” adds the Director. The laboratory also offers a Texturothèque® service, so customers can choose the texture they want from a portfolio of standard, customizable formulas. When they settled in the city of Dinard in 2008, ABC Texture made a pioneering choice with an HQE-certified, 2,000 m2 industrial site. Building standards were complied with. For example, the excavation soil was used to create a natural fence. Also, the building’s orientation was designed to prevent high temperature variations: it is made from bio-bricks to preserve inertia between winter and summer. It is powered by renewable energies, etc. “We wanted a smart plant. Of course, it was 30% more expensive, but we make up for this with energy gains and the building’s sustainability. The environment is also more pleasant for employees,” says Louisette Bourdin. Alongside committed brands, including conventional ones in a transformational phase willing to develop more natural ranges, ABC Texture adapts to different markets and achieves 30% of its turnover with export. In line with the wave of Clean Beauty, ABC Texture meets a rising, accelerated, contextualized demand, says Louisette Bourdin. “There is an increasing demand for naturalness, but also for projects with a faster time-to-market. Brands used to give us 18 months to two years, now they require six months to one year, so it is essential to start with standard options to be customized according to customers’ needs. As we are dealing with supply difficulties with raw materials and increasingly strict CSR strategies, our customers also keep asking for more: local products made in Europe, France, or even Brittany.  All this should be meaningful, because they need a story to tell,” she concludes."
Unilever and Geno launch new venture to scale alternative cleansing ingredients,"With USD120 million (about EUR114.3 million) jointly invested in the newly-formed initiative, and with other strategic investors expected to join, the venture aims to develop a plant-based alternative to palm oil using biotechnology to be used for cleaning and personal care products. According to the duo behind the initiative, there are currently few viable alternatives to palm and fossil sources that can be produced at scale in order to make those ingredients. Geno’s research and development team has deployed more than USD 300 million in technology investment to create a portfolio of 2,200 patents and applications covering product pathways, synthetic biology approaches to engineering microorganisms, processes to bio-manufacture products, their sometimes unique biological compositions, and product applications. “Our technology enables pathways for alternative sourcing of materials whose supply chains often have limited social and environmental transparency, by offering more resilient supply chains that are transparent, traceable and responsibly-sourced, as demanded by consumers. Beyond creating new transparent and responsibly sourced-supply chains and alternatively-sourced materials, our Geno technology also represents the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 100 million tons in upcoming years,” said Christophe Schilling, Geno CEO. Geno will deploy its biotechnology platform and is already starting to scale the process for its advanced technology to produce the ingredients. Initial estimates have shown that companies could reduce the carbon footprint of palm-derived ingredients by up to 50% with this technology-driven, plant-based alternative. Companies like Unilever, whose products are used globally by 3.4 billion people each day, are increasingly partnering with biotechnology innovators to explore, develop, and manufacture new versions of traditionally-sourced ingredients. “While palm oil will remain an important feedstock to Unilever, these alternative ingredients can play a growing role in diversifying supply chains to drive optionality, sustainability, cost efficiencies and transparency,” said the company in a statement. For Unilever, one of the world’s biggest soap and detergent manufacturers, this is the largest investment in biotechnology alternatives to palm oil to date. As such, the venture offers the opportunity to tap into the combined USD 625 billion home and personal care markets. During the recent months, palm oil - as many other vegetal oils - has been recording price hikes at an all-time high. In a context of increased uncertainty on supply chains, it is strategic for major users to diversify their sources of such key materials. “Biotechnology has the potential to revolutionise the sourcing of our cleansing ingredients and ensure Unilever is a future-fit business – for consumers, shareholders and the planet we all share. This new venture will sit at the intersection of science and sustainability, meaning we can continue to grow our business without relying only on palm oil or fossil fuel derivatives, while also making our supply chains more resilient from having access to ingredient alternatives. We will be marrying science and nature to make sure there is no tradeoff for our consumers between the efficacy and sustainability of their products. We are building this innovative new venture to have the scale to drive real impact and change in our industry, helping to reinvent the chemistry of home and personal care products for the 21st Century,” said Unilever’s Chief R&D Officer Richard Slater."
"“We re-root Vichy in scientific expertise,” Vania Lacascade","Premium Beauty News - Vichy Laboratoires is a dermocosmetics pioneer in France. How do you define the brand today? Vania Lacascade - Founded by a doctor almost 90 years ago, it is firmly rooted in health and science. It is part of the L’Oréal Active Cosmetics Division and is mainly distributed in pharmacies and parapharmacies. It is recommended by over 50,000 dermatologists around the world, in particular the haircare and anti-ageing ranges. Two years ago, we readopted our initial brand signature, which dated back to the 1990s: health also depends on our skin. It really is the brand’s philosophy: the skin is a health barometer, so we need to get to know it and take care of it. Health is more than ever at the core of all our concerns. Premium Beauty News - How do you express this health concern? Vania Lacascade - We have been working on the exposome science for several years: it is the study of the impact on our skins of our environments (pollution, climate), lifestyles, but also hormone variations, which can have significant consequences on the skin’s biological functions. We have three committees of dermatologists dedicated to the study of the exposome to understand the cumulative effects of these different factors on the skin and scalp, in the different phases of life. During the 2000s, the brand decided to get deeply involved in the management of menopause and its impacts on the skin. This issue is still taboo in society, but people are starting to speak out. Last September, we relaunched Neovadiol, our skincare range dedicated to the menopause. It was also a new way to openly communicate on this key phase of women’s lives. Premium Beauty News - How do you highlight scientific expertise? Vania Lacascade - Over the past three years, we have considerably strengthened our presence alongside health professionals. We conducted about forty studies, published about twenty articles, and we made a strong comeback at major dermatology congresses. In addition, we tightened our relationships with dermatologists, but also with pharmacists, in particular as regards the menopause. For our part, this theme was a major area of improvement, thanks to our research on the impact of hormone variations on the skin, in particular falling oestrogen levels and rising cortisol levels. Our relationship with pharmacists proved all the more essential in managing this phase of women’s lives. I am a pharmacist myself and I know how crucial it is to benefit from this support in pharmacies, because they can help women with it. We reviewed this skincare range to be in line with our advances in knowledge, in particular as regards the two phases of menopause, the peri- and postmenopause, which do not involve the same needs. As I said, it is still taboo, so we also launched an awareness campaign with our range called “skincare for menopause”, without any ambiguity. It was crucial to open up the debate, in particular with round tables, testimonies, and tips. We aimed to make women speak up and support every one of them through this phase of their lives and with their management by health professionals. Premium Beauty News - How is Vichy Laboratoires positioned compared to the group’s other brands? Vania Lacascade - With its scientific expertise in the impacts of the exposome on the skin and scalp, Vichy targets women and men in all life phases. Puberty with Normaderm, the thirties with daily skincare like Mineral, the first signs of ageing, down to dark spots, with Lift Active, the menopause with Neovadiol… In parallel, the Dercos range helps us take scientific action for the scalp. So, we are complementary to our sister brands, we support people throughout their lives. Our brand is very close to consumers, highly inclusive: it targets women and men of all ages. Premium Beauty News - What about sustainability? Vania Lacascade - It is a global approach of the L’Oréal group. Our demanding dermatological charter helps us guarantee the safety and efficacy of our products, but with the great challenge to develop more sustainable formulas with dermatological raw materials and ingredients derived from sustainable sources. Biotechnology also brings a lot in this field. We have clear objectives, i.e. 95% of bio-based ingredients or ingredients rich in abundant minerals by 2030, and 100% derived from sustainable sources. We constantly review our formulas to improve their environmental profiles, in particular their biodegradability. As for sun care products, we have been reformulating our portfolio to offer a profile that is more ocean- and marine-biodiversity friendly. As regards packaging, we aim to reduce weight and use recycled plastic. This sustainable innovation strategy has been integrated to our development programme for years and is part of the group’s more global approach. Premium Beauty News - What are your projects innovation-wise? Vania Lacascade - Prioritize flagship categories, keep forging ahead with anti-ageing skincare, explore the hormone issue, in particular the menopause and haircare, but also sun care, since the UV impact is a major factor of the exposome to be taken into account. All this is part of a strategy for the continuous improvement of our formulas’ environmental footprints and profiles, while guaranteeing safety and efficacy. Premium Beauty News - What can you tell us about your market targets? Vania Lacascade - The brand is present in over 60 countries and very well-established in Europe, our historical market. It is also very strong in countries like Canada and Brazil. The latter is actually our biggest market globally: the brand’s positioning is healthcare-oriented, in particular with hair care. Dercos is the first brand recommended by dermatologists for anti-dandruff care. China and the US are markets on which we aim to further develop, in particular with face and hair care. Lastly, we aim to keep re-rooting the brand in its medical ground, both for healthcare professionals and consumers. We are more than ever legitimate on the dermocosmetics market, thanks to our scientific expertise, and we pay particular attention to developing real proximity and an authentic tone in our communication."
"""New markets are emerging for perfumes,"" Xavier Ardizio, Argeville","Premium Beauty News - In 2021, Argeville joined the closed circle of hundred-year-old companies. Today, it is an internationally renowned company that embodies the success of French perfumery and Provençal know-how. Xavier Ardizio - Argeville employs 310 people worldwide and has a turnover of 60 million euros thanks to three activities: Perfumery, which represents more than 80% of our sales, natural ingredients, and food flavourings. 90% of our sales are to international customers. Asia is our fastest-growing market. We are present in China, Thailand and Vietnam. We opened a production site in Bangkok in 2019, which allows us to serve our regional customers with greater agility. There is a real interest in perfumery and Made in France ingredients. We employ some 30 people in Dubai where we opened a creative centre in 2012. The Middle East represents 30% of our business, it is also a platform for accessing African markets where we anticipate significant growth in the coming years, with local players in full development. With this in mind, we will be opening an office in Johannesburg next July. We are also present in South America, with a sales office and a small laboratory in Bogota, Colombia. Premium Beauty News - This international presence allows you to have a global vision of the perfume market. What are the main challenges for the future? Xavier Ardizio - What we observe everywhere is a growing demand for natural ingredients. Consumers want quality perfumes, derived as much as possible from nature. To meet these expectations, we can draw on our heritage. When Argeville was founded, it specialised in the cultivation of perfume plants from the Grasse region. More recently, we have invested in an extraction site located in La Laupie, in the Drôme area, to make it our centre of expertise for natural products. We have also set up partnerships with French producers of perfume plants to foster the development of short circuits and secure our supply chain. But whatever the ingredients’ origin, mastering sourcing has become a strategic issue in perfumery. It allows guaranteeing supplies, ensuring the product traceability and controlling their quality. Throughout the world, our perfumers are prescribers in the choice of the grades we buy. To obtain the best options, we have to work in close partnership with our producers. Premium Beauty News - Isn’t this emphasis on natural products detrimental to innovation? Xavier Ardizio - Absolutely not. There is a lot to do in this field, which is very far from having been fully explored. We are constantly looking for new materials and new qualities. We are working on new, more efficient and more sustainable extraction methods. Environmental issues also compel us to be inventive. Our R&D is therefore devoting a lot of energy to reducing the use of solvents, finding new formulation methods and reducing transport costs. Premium Beauty News - The world of perfumery is an incredibly competitive arena. What are Argeville’s assets in this sector today? Xavier Ardizio - Argeville is an independent family business. Our customers are large family-run SMEs that are like us, they are attracted by our reputation as a century-old company in the Grasse area, our accessibility and our agility. They are companies in tune with our values: Excellence, humility, audacity and pleasure! Our expertise in natural ingredients and our mastery of the supply chain round off our list of strong points. Finally, we are one of the few companies with 360° expertise and with the capability to offer a complete service for the creation of fragrance lines via our sister company 1st.Mood, based in Valbonne. Premium Beauty News - How do you see the future of the perfume market? Xavier Ardizio - Formulation will continue to evolve towards more naturalness and sustainability. This is an unstoppable trend. At the same time, new markets will emerge, particularly in Asia and Africa. People who did not have access to perfume before will develop an interest in these products, and growth will continue globally. We are therefore carrying on with our investments. At the industrial level, our Mougins site will move to Grasse in a brand new factory, which will be home to a new automated weighing robot. Works are scheduled to start in September 2022 and be completed in April 2024. This is an investment of around 25 million euros. On the commercial side, we intend to expand our international network: the opening of our South African office is the first step toward other projects that should come to fruition in 2023!"
Hinode seeks to increase global footprint and to sell in 30 countries by 2030,"Like other Brazilian beauty giants, Hinode was born in a garage: the one of wife and husband Adélaïde and Francisco Rodrigues. At that time, Adélaïde was a seamstress and supplemented the family income by selling beauty products. Within a few years, it happened that she was earning more than her husband, a metallurgist. The couple then began to work together, before launching their own brand in 1988. Hinode’s entry into the country’s list of leading cosmetics companies has its roots in 2008, when the company - which then had an annual turnover of around 8 million reais - when it shifted its business model to a multi-level marketing (MLM) strategy. The growth became exponential with a turnover reaching 2.7 billion reais in 2018. “However, we faced growth difficulties,” explains Erica Pagano, Vice President Product Innovation and Branding. ""It was time to reorganize the entire house,"" she says. Product shortage, lack of sales advisers and the difficulty of measuring business performance were among the difficulties to overcome as the company’s turnover fell to 1.6 billion reais in 2020. From 2019, the company began to change its governance: the members of the Rodrigues family gradually move towards seats on the board of directors and the management of the company was entrusted to Marilia Rocca, the current CEO, and experienced executives were appointed to top management positions. In parallel, the entire product catalogue also had to be reshuffled. The number of SKUs was reduced from 1000 to 350 - most of them being manufactured at the company’s 12,000 m2 industrial site, which opened in 2017 in Jandira, in the metropolitan area of São Paulo. “Our portfolio was very large and had no clear direction. Today, we offer a portfolio centred on beauty and healthy lifestyles,” says Erica Pagano. “We want our sales advisors to be real specialists and to be able to provide the best possible product demonstrations,” she adds. The offer was not only refocused, it was also radically renewed. ""Our motto is that nothing is that good that it cannot be improved"", continues Pagano. The new Routine Dermo skin care line thus succeeded Age Reverse with products featuring the Skintelligent exclusive technology, which facilitates the penetration of active ingredients. And as for the Joli PreciOus Oils body care line, it is now made from essential and vegetable oils. Perfumery, which accounts for 50% of Hinode’s sales, has also been enriched with new products. Fragrances in the Life collection, were co-created with Firmenich and feature their H-Emotions technology, which uses neuroscience to create emotions. “In addition to keeping an eye on global trends and what the consumer is looking for, one’s  have to invest in technology so as not to be overwhelmed,” insists the innovation manager. Packaging is also a key issue. One of the brand’s best-sellers, the Hands cream, is now packed in green plastic derived from sugar cane. And the Dazzle makeup line offers many products in cardboard packaging. “We want to deliver the best products with the least environmental impact”. A few months ago, the brand presented its new positioning. The distinction between the name in Brazil (Hinode) and the international name (HND) was abandoned for Hinode Group, due to be used on a global scale. Currently available across eight countries in Latin American (Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Paraguay), the company is now targeting new territories. “Our ambition is to be present in 30 countries by 2030,” concludes Erica Pagano. For 2022, Hinode Group forecasts a turnover of 1.9 billion reais (about USD 397.8 million or EUR 371 million)."
LVMH eyes India’s burgeoning beauty market with investment in Sugar Cosmetics,"Sugar Cosmetics, a cult favourite beauty brands amongst Gen Z and Millennial consumers in India, and one of the country’s largest beauty companies, has closed USD 50 million Series D fundraise led by the Asia fund of L Catterton. “The upsized round saw strong interest from multiple private equity funds with continued participation from existing investors - A91 Partners, Elevation Capital, and India Quotient - firmly placing the company on track to further capitalize on its growth momentum in the rapidly expanding beauty and personal care market in India,” said L Catterton, a global private equity firm part-owned by LVMH, in a statement. Sugar Cosmetics offers an extensive portfolio of beauty products across the lips, eyes, face, nails and skin categories and has more than quadrupled sales over the past three years. Products are sourced from suppliers in Germany, Italy, India, USA and Korea, and are sold online and through a network of 40,000 retail outlets across 550 Indian cities. “The company’s effective use of new-age, impact-focused content marketing has helped it develop lasting emotional connections with a diverse range of consumer cohorts,” highlighted L Catterton. L Catterton, which is mostly focused on middle market companies and emerging high-growth enterprises, intends to build on their strategic relationship with LVMH to help Sugar Cosmetics to embark on their next stage of growth amid the expansion of India’s beauty and personal care market. L Catterton has significant experience investing globally in the beauty and personal care industry. Their current and past investments in the space include Il Makiage, Intercos, The Honest Company, Tula, Bliss, CI Flavors, Elemis, Etvos, Function of Beauty, Marubi, Merit, and Sociolla, among others. “The move comes at a time when the Indian cosmetics and toiletries market is at an inflection point,” commented Bobby Verghese, Consumer Analyst at GlobalData. Driven by consumers who are increasingly making cosmetics and skincare a part of their daily repertoire and experimenting with different types of products, India’s beauty and personal care market has expanded considerably over the past five years. Rising adoption of online shopping and greater product penetration in secondary cities are also contributing to the market’s enlargement. According to GlobalData, sales of beauty products grew by 5.6% CAGR [1] during 2015-2020, with value sales rising from US 11.1 billion in 2015 to USD 14.6 billion in 2020, when COVID-19 arrived. With the pandemic restrictions easing gradually, GlobalData forecasts the cosmetics and toiletries sales in India to grow by 7.2% CAGR over 2020-2025 to reach USD 20.6 billion in 2025. “Startups such as Sugar Cosmetics and Nykaa are well positioned to tap the fast-paced growth in online beauty retail through their mastery of the omnichannel distribution model,” conluded Verghese."
SoPost seeks to adapt sampling campaigns to each market specificities,"Campaigns powered by SoPost are integrated to brands’ communication environments through a multitude of digital channels, like social media, EDMs, influencers, the SoPost testing community – and there are also several integration possibilities on websites. Every targeted consumer is invited to interact with the SoPost form by providing their contact details and consent in a 100% customized brand world. “Once the product has been received and tested, every consumer is invited to share their feedback. We suggest leaving a comment and note, or they can fill in a questionnaire that is tailor-made with the brand to get both quantitative and qualitative insights. The campaign is part of a communication journey with consumers, before, during, and after product testing,” explains Hélène Tournesac, Director of SoPost partnerships in France. The solution also guarantees a last step involving a redirection to the website, e-shop, or retailer web page in order to invite consumers to purchase the real size product. All data collected by SoPost belong to the brand. SoPost only takes care of collection and processing matters. “There are two types of data. When the contact details required for shipping are provided, the brand also offers consumers an opt-in option. If they agree, their personal data will later be used by the brand for marketing communication/CRM purposes. This consent is optional, but we have found out that on average, almost 50% of the people who order the sample give their consent,” says the Director. “We do not collect data indirectly: we always work with voluntary declarative data and never use behavioural or contextual data. SoPost’s positioning has always involved absolute transparency with consumers in perfect line with the regulations in force,” adds Hélène Tournesac. The solution is actually adapted to regulatory constraints, which vary from one market to another. “In Germany, for example, double consent is mandatory. The form includes a first consent, and then we send an email to consumers for them to confirm they agree to provide the brand with their contact details,” explains Hélène Tournesac. Founded in Newcastle ten years ago, the company is now expanding outside its main markets, the UK and the US, to focus on new European and global territories, including France and Germany – they have worked on it for almost a year – and even Australia, where an office will soon open. By setting up local teams, SoPost aims to better stick to each country’s own cultural features and to the various regulatory constraints on data management and routing in order to ensure execution optimization. “It is important to adapt to local cultures, in particular to language, and to be familiar with every country’s legal framework. Each feature requires a perfectly adapted digital solution. As for routing, by developing close relationships with our local logistics centres, we get familiar with regulations on packaging, labelling, and shipping. It is essential, because there are different prerequisites when it comes to shipping samples. Lastly, our strength lies in our ability to be operational on multiple markets, so we can coordinate and harmonize operations for the same brand on the global level,” says the Director. As such, the SoPost e-sampling solution helps fulfil several brand objectives: implement a global marketing strategy, exert influence on the brand’s reputation, develop an audience, increase sales, and collect data for marketing purposes. “We help our customers choose and activate the digital environments best-adapted to their own strategy to target relevant audiences depending on their communication plans and objectives. Our solution offers a sampling journey from A to Z, both online and offline. We aim to create a rich, flawless consumer experience. With our solution, we mainly work on targeted sample distribution, so we streamline volumes and distribution, but we also set up the journey and collect feedback. Targeted sampling has become crucial for brands,” concludes Hélène Tournesac."
Amyi offers an educational olfactory journey to Brazil’s fragrance lovers,"“Brazilians are passionate about perfume. Our country is the second largest market in the world by value and the first by volume, with consumption in litres per capita almost three times higher than that of France. Despite this, we are still lagging behind in terms of innovation and consumers have a poor knowledge of olfactory journeys, ingredients and essences. We want to contribute to the education of Brazilians in the field of perfumery,” explains Luciana Guidi. For consumers, choosing a new perfume is a real challenge, and not only in the case of online purchases. ""Who has never regretted its purchase after having discovered that the initial scent of a fragrance had completely changed half an hour after testing it in store? It’s because we didn’t have time to understand how the perfume evolves. The top notes evaporate very quickly and the fragrance that will come with us for the rest of the day is not the one that was smelled at the time of purchase,” explains Larissa Mota. To facilitate the choice, the two co-founders have created an online platform that assist and educate consumers. As a first step: customers have to answer a questionnaire on their preferences, their profile and behaviour. Based on these answers, an artificial intelligence then suggests a trial kit consisting of 7 ml miniatures, test strips and online access for a training session to finalize the choice of the perfume. The next step takes place once the samples have been received and tested by the customer. It is necessary to reconnect to the platform,  where additional information on the perfumes is available, with videos of perfumers explaining how they chose the ingredients, and much more. To facilitate understanding, Amyi fragrances are associated with colours, textures, sounds and memories. “We help consumers identify the ingredients and the olfactory paths that they like or not,” explains Luciana Guidi. Once the perfume has been chosen, it is sent at home in a 100 ml version. “We seek not only to innovate in the way of choosing and selling perfumes in Brazil, but also to transform the market itself. This is just the beginning. We will continue to help Brazilians get to know perfumery better so that we can create truly personalized fragrances for each of our consumers, with the help of artificial intelligence,” emphasizes Luciana Guidi. The perfumes are designed by Brazilian perfumers from major international houses, such as Givaudan, Takasago or Symrise, but with great creative freedom. ""We firmly believe in the potential of Brazilian perfumers,"" says Amyi co-founder. “There are few perfumers in the world, but 20% of them are in Brazil. We want to give visibility to these great artists and make Brazilian perfumery a global reference in terms of trends,” she adds. Amyi’s fragrances are gender neutral, vegan and made with ingredients that are not common in Brazil, such as Egyptian jasmine absolute, aged oud wood, rhubarb and black iris. The Brazilian DNVB raised around BRL 400,000 from private investors for its launch in 2019. In 2020, it received an additional investment of BRL 1 million, which enabled them to expand their product range. Launched as a 100% online business, which has been successful so far, the brand plans to meet new consumers by opening a kiosk in a shopping centre in São Paulo. “We believe in diversifying sales channels to reach more people, but we will only take this step if we manage to transpose the educational and sensory concept of Amyi into a physical point of sale. We are not a usual perfumery brand”, concludes Luciana Guidi."
MakeUp in Paris prepares the return of beauty innovation,"After a successful 2021 edition in October, MakeUp in Paris expects to welcome more than 150 exhibitors and 4000 visitors to resume business and innovation as usual. Once again, the event will gather suppliers of ingredients, formulation, packaging, accessories, full service and digital solutions and devices. “The pandemic has disrupted the trade show business, but the beauty industry, more than any other sector, needs a real trade show with face-to-face contact. The use of the five senses is mandatory to evaluate a beauty product,” explains Sandra Maguarian, Show Founder and Director. Following the rise of the hybridization of makeup and skincare, MakeUp in has adapted its offer to meet the expectations of the market. For several years now, the show has welcomed suppliers of skincare products alongside traditional exhibitors from the make-up sector.

Womaness becomes first menopause brand to enter Ulta Beauty,"Womaness is entering select Ulta Beauty stores and online as part of The Wellness Shop - a curated offering of self-care and wellness products for the mind, body, and spirit. The partnership provides retail access and visibility to items that cater specifically to the needs of the 40+ woman. The brand was co-founded in 2021 by Sally Mueller and Michelle Jacobs, born out of the desire to speak to and serve the 50+ million women approaching or in menopause, and dealing with the most common symptoms, from hot flashes and sleep issues, to light leakage and fine lines. ""Our mission from day one has been to change the conversation around menopause and the women experiencing it,"" said Womaness co-founder and COO Michelle Jacobs. ""We want to be the first brand women think of when they think of menopause, offering them a collection of innovative products that address the most common (and often taboo) symptoms."" ""We’re thrilled to be offering Womaness solutions to the Ulta Beauty guest,"" continues Womaness co-founder and CEO Sally Mueller. ""We’re here to make it easier for women in menopause to shop in the places they love to find the products they need to feel unstoppable. It’s a powerful moment that Ulta Beauty has recognized that women in this stage deserve to take up more space both in life and on shelves at retail."" Formulated alongside a panel of menopausal experts including gynecologists who specialize in menopause, women’s health experts, and nutritionists and skincare experts who understand the ingredients that are most effective for menopausal skin, Womaness offers solutions in skin and body care, feminine care, sexual health, and supplements.

Aircos lends its powder expertise on skin and personal care applications,"Aircos, the French leading developer and manufacturer of powder cosmetics, continues to diversify its offer. After having launched a range of cleansing and exfoliating powders in 2020, the company seized the opportunity of the Clean Beauty in London trade show to introduce its BeautyTabs technological platform for environmentally friendly products. Since they facilitate the reuse of primary containers, these compressed powders are in line with the current quest for plastic packaging reduction. They are perfectly suited to the creation of refillable cosmetic concepts. “With the BeautyTabs technology, Aircos promotes product reuse and a reduced dependency on plastic, with no discarded packaging, no water transport, and a refillable, multi-use product,” said the company in a statement. In practical terms, the consumer inserts the tablet into a designated refillable bottle and adds water to the marked line. Then, he just has to let the formulation dissolve and to mix it to get a ready-to-use product. Compressed powders make it possible to create on-the-go products, suitable for many uses, and requiring very few packaging material, while maintaining the sensory experience and efficiency associated with aqueous formulas. With this 100% ’Made In France’ technology, Aircos offers “clean” formulas that are talc-free and silicone-free. As of now, Aircos offers its customers a line of fully customized personal care formula made of up to 99.7% natural ingredients and COSMOS certifiable. Furthermore, the company is currently working on skin care formulations to complete its offer. They are expected to be available in the coming months. “Today, the cosmetics industry is facing an ongoing challenge to meet both environmental challenges and consumer expectations. They are ready to rethink their consumption habits and adopt zero waste approaches that take into account the product’s packaging, its reuse, and the impact of its water consumption and transportation. On average, a conventional shower gel is composed of 80% water, most often in disposable plastic packaging. With BeautyTabs compressed dissolvable powders, the rules have been rewritten so that consumers can reassemble their product in a fun and eco-friendly way,” highlights the Anjac Group subsidiary. With the BeautyTabs technology, Aircos is strengthening its investment, development, and innovation strategy through solutions that combine eco-responsibility and efficiency."
"“Nail polish is more natural, safe, and efficient,” Pierre Miasnik, Fiabila","If the pandemic boosted the demand for nail polish, it also sped up pre-existing trends, including for this category: naturalness, removal of controversial ingredients, search for performance… “Over the past ten years, there has been an unprecedented technological mutation in the nail polish sector,” explains Pierre Miasnik, CEO of Fiabila, one of the industry’s leaders. And the French company has largely contributed to it! As monomer-based gel formulas are being marketed, although their use is not completely safe, Fiabila has chosen to innovate by offering alternative solutions adapted to consumer expectations. “We are working on several technologies adapted to the different market segments. But, whatever the technical choice, we always offer high-quality, 100% vegan formulas produced in plants that comply with the strictest quality and environmental protection norms,” adds the CEO, “to offer ever-more natural, safe, and efficient products.” All these technologies and innovations will be showcased in Bologna, Italy, at the next Cosmopack show, where Fiabila will display a collection of conventional nail polish, i.e. all nail polish products based on the formation of a film by solvent evaporation. Today, these products are divided into two large categories: traditional petro-sourced formulas, and biosourced formulas, which are increasingly popular among brands and consumers. “Today, we can reach levels as high as 90% of biosourced raw materials with highly satisfactory quality. All our formulas are tested on panels and their levels of performance (lasting results, drying, shininess, etc.) are perfectly calibrated,” adds Pierre Miasnik. Beyond that, more recently, Fiabila re-deployed the technology of reactive or hybrid formulas, which consists in adapting conventional formulas for a hybrid use of nail polish – hence its name. Such formulas contain an oligomer which provides them with additional properties. The application is the same as with conventional nail polish: the film forms after the evaporation of solvents and when the oligomer physically dries. Then, an overlayer is applied to make the film polymerize: in the presence of UV rays (natural light or LED lamp), the nail polish hardens and become even shinier. “The result is truly exceptional, the nail polish is shiny and lasts eight days,” emphasizes Pierre Miasnik. Fiabila has patented two oligomers for these hybrid formulas. As a complement, the Salon Prodigy technology is composed of formulas reactive under LED lamps designed to compete with gel formulas containing monomers. The use of oligomers instead of monomers prevents the formation of an occlusive film particularly difficult to remove. If it lasts a bit less long, the product is much healthier for nails! Besides these two large families, Fiabila offers solvent-free water-based nail polish. There is a range for children, which can be removed with water and soap, and a range for adults, which is removed with a nail polish remover. Lastly, Fiabila boasts two recent innovations: the Do Not Disturb technology, which offers almost odourless formulas much praised in Asia, and a range of ecodesigned nail polish with recycled solvents retrieved during the company’s manufacturing process, so that purity levels can be guaranteed. All these solutions help meet market expectations related to naturalness and performance! And since, on all segments, safety remains the main concern, Fiabila developed several methods to limit the eventual formation of nitrosamines in formulas. This has become a hot topic, in particular in Switzerland, Germany, and Austria, where rules have been tightened as regards this issue. According to the company, by removing particular clay types, bentonites, and using inhibitors, under certain conditions, the presence of these substances can be divided by ten. A patent was registered for this technology. From an industrial standpoint, Fiabila has kept investing, so the company now boasts sufficient capacities to keep up with a global market boom. As an example, the group has just opened a new filling site in Poland. The 8,000-m2 plant has been operational since early April: it is equipped with automated lines, cutting-edge equipment identical to that of the group’s other units, and technicians trained in France for three years. Always seeking optimum quality, Fiabila has also just finished restoring the pigment crushing unit of its plant located in Maintenon, in the south-west of Paris. The new technology implemented significantly minimizes the risk of pigment air contamination. As a matter of fact, for the second year in a row, the site has obtained the EcoVadis Platinum certification for CSR. Fiabila is working to have this level of performance recognized for all its units around the world with more global labels."
"Start-up: Eclo, a unique, virtuous cosmetics concept","After twelve years spent in a cosmetics multinational company as a makeup product development manager, Priscille Charton wanted to give life to her own idea of more responsible cosmetics. “Day after day, I increasingly felt like applying eco-design to product innovation. The offering of clean makeup is limited, because the market is less mature than clean skincare: things are technically more complex. I was aware of the urgency to innovate differently in this field,” says Priscille Charton, co-founder of Eclo with Julien Callède and Marin Susac. Together, they created a makeup brand “not to make beauty rhyme with guilty”. “I wanted efficient formulas that would satisfy consumers’ senses, but with zero ecotoxicity. So, both the formulas and packaging needed to be biodegradable,” adds the founder. In fact, the formulas designed to be applied with the finger are packed in Finnish startup Sulapac’s small, fully biodegradable round jars. The cap’s colour helps identify the product family: four lipsticks, red and pink with universal shades; three blushes, peach, bronze, and pink; and four highly mineral, nature-inspired eye shadow shades. A concealing foundation range should come out next fall, as well as a mascara. All products are Cosmos-Organic-certified and 100% of natural origin, made from vegetable wax and mineral pigments. They are made in Brittany, in the Rance Bay, in the Western part of France. The Eclo concept goes beyond formula and packaging naturalness. It is based on regenerative farming, which preserves the quality of farming soils by protecting living organisms. “We worked with the association called Pour une Agriculture du Vivant to set up a list of raw materials that were good for both the skin and soils,” explains Priscille Charton. Three ingredients were selected for the first range. Hemp from Brittany provides eye shadow formulas with soothing and moisturizing benefits. Also, it cleans up soils by absorbing toxins and heavy metals, and it resists climatic variations without requiring much water. Rye is used in blushes to confer a natural healthy look. “This plant boasts kilometres of roots abundant with biodiversity. It is a habitat for living organisms: worms, mushrooms, rodents… It creates regenerated soils on which anything that grows is richer in nutrients and more nourishing,” says Priscille Charton. As for lipsticks, algae from the Rance Bay (in Brittany) were chosen for their smoothing, plumping properties. “They represent an essential part of the marine ecosystem. We ensure their preservation with reasonable, reasoned cultures,” explains the founder. The partnership with the association Agriculture Pour le Vivant is also aimed to educate the cosmetics industry as regards the use of this type of ingredients. “It is a brand new concept with which our industry is not familiar. We are the first members of this association to be part of the cosmetics sector. We are leading the way. We mean to state that if one uses natural raw materials in their formulas, they should have grown in a sustainable manner, by giving the land its full powers back. To this aim, we need to educate not only ingredient suppliers, but also producers, so they consider supplying the cosmetics industry, not just the food industry. It works both ways,” explains Priscille Charton. In addition, Eclo is a partner of 1% For The Planet, so they give part of their turnover to an association which helps preserve the environment. At the end of the ongoing crowdfunding campaign, the products will be available online on the brand’s e-shop, and then in concept stores. “We have already received a lot of business requests, because our concept is innovative. It all goes so fast,” concludes the founder."
La Compagnie de Provence banks on skincare and gets global,"Launched by two friends determined to modernize the use of Savon de Marseille, La Compagnie de Provence soon got the public success expected. A brand of the Ganassini group since 2013, the company now boasts a range of 180 references, counts 1,000 points of sale in France, and exports products in about 40 countries. “I joined La Compagnie de Provence six years ago with one mission: it consisted in repositioning the brand, ensuring it was in line with market trends and consumer expectations,” explains Guillaume Cornu Thénard. Building on the dermocosmetics expertise of the Ganassini group, La Compagnie de Provence managed to broaden its offering with a substantial face & body care range. “We created collections with shea butter for the sake of its nourishing virtues, and with velvet algae for its moisturizing benefits. More recently, our holistic apothecary collection combined vegetable and essential oils, and we also have an anti-ageing line with antioxidant fig. We always make a clear, very simple promise, so consumers immediately understand what they buy. This is part of our brand’s codes – we used to write Savon Liquide Marseille in big capital letters on our bottles,” says Guillaume Cornu Thénard. Today, liquid soap still accounts for 46% of the turnover. It is the entry and discovery point for the brand, but in just a few years, face care and body care have reached a 10% and 30% share, respectively. Home product references (candles, dispensers, cleaning products) complete the picture. The formulas are composed of at least 95% of ingredients of natural origin. Flagship ingredients are mainly derived from short distribution channels in Provence, and the primary packaging is made from glass or rPET. All inks are plant-derived. “We made a significant investment and recruited a person in charge of our CSR policy. All the objectives defined by the UN were fulfilled, and this year, we will mainly focus on life quality at work, bearing in mind that the company employs about 40 people. Then, our second target will have to do with packaging to make sure we use as little plastic as possible. Our last priority will be our carbon footprint. All this shows how committed we must be, and we will publish our results at the end of the year,” explains Guillaume Cornu Thénard. As it plans to achie a 7.3-million-euro turnover this year, with an annual growth rate of 10%, the brand keeps developing in France: it will boast about 1,000 points of sale by the end of the year, mainly in the perfume world – at Sephora’s and Marionnaud’s –, which will represent 300 of them by late 2022. Pharmacies make up the second network, and concept stores, the third. “We have also defined two other priorities: digital technologies, with our e-shop, which represents more than 10% of our turnover, and wholly-owned stores, because they are crucial in terms of consumer experience. All this helps understand the specificity of our brand, between modernity and tradition,” adds the General Manager. The brand counts seven wholly-owned stores mainly located in southern France. No further openings are scheduled this year, but the Marseille shop should be redesigned to house an organic coffee shop, a wall of ingredients and, more importantly, a refill fountain. This concept has already been implemented at Galeries Lafayette and in the headquarters store in Aix-en-Provence. Export accounts for 65% of the company’s turnover, with a presence in about 40 countries, in particular in department stores (Europe, North America, Argentina, Asia, and Oceania). “The brand quickly managed to establish itself abroad, because people all around the world have a passion for traditional as well as contemporary Provence. This is what makes La Compagnie de Provence unique: we talk a lot about lavender and olive trees, but we equally highlight La Cité Radieuse by Le Corbusier, the LUMA tower, the Mucem, the Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilizations, impressionism… Over the past few years, new cultural and architectural dynamics in Provence have perfectly echoed our brand’s initial positioning,” concludes Guillaume Cornu Thénard."
"Mane creates a consumers research lab for perfumes in São Paulo, Brazil","Dubbed Casa do Consumidor (House of the Consumer) the new area is designed to recreate the real situations in which consumer products are used. It includes: blind test rooms, a beauty salon, shower cabins, a bathroom with a camera and even a miniature railway, where a locomotive runs to measure the a perfume’s sillage. “In order to better develop our perfumes and aromas, we seek to listen to the consumer from the start of the development process, our aim is to be able to deliver products that meet the needs and expectations of our customers. By testing the creations with the final consumer at each stage, we can be more precise in our proposals,” explains Alexandra Frenkiel, Head of Market Research and Consumer Insights at Mane. The company already has testing facilities in many countries, but the majority only hosts the company’s teams. However, Mane’s premises in New Jersey, United States, are the only ones to feature a space intended to host consumers, as the one recently created in Brazil. According to Alexandra Frenkiel, Mane’s goal is to respond more quickly and precisely to the demands of its customers, helping them to launch on the market products that will meet consumer expectations. Present in around forty countries, Mane sees in Brazil a “significant and priority growth potential for the group”. Perfumery represents 60% of the company’s turnover in the country, compared to 35% worldwide. Mane, whose industrial headquarters are in Rio de Janeiro, also plans to open a new factory in Brazil. The kickstart of the works, initially planned for 2016, has however been postponed, “given the macroeconomic context”. However, a new study should be launched soon for the construction of a manufacturing unit in the municipality of Jundiaí, in the state of São Paulo. “With the aim to put it into service in the first quarter of 2024”, indicates Alexandra Frenkiel."
Into the Metaverse - The future of beauty retail and customer experience,"The pandemic has fundamentally changed the way we live, work, and interact. With heightened restrictions, lockdowns, and social distancing rules halting many in-person activities, consumers have increasingly moved toward online channels, and companies have responded in turn. The adoption of digital products and services in the past two years has taken off at a rapid pace, with a McKinsey Global Survey of executives citing that companies have accelerated the digitization of their customer and supply chain interactions and of their internal operations by three to four years. As consumers spend more time on their connected devices and detract from real-world connections, they are craving deeper social interaction. For consumers, this highly immersive virtual world is a place where they can come together to play, work, and live unique experiences, allowing for new ways of engagement and socialization. For brands and retailers, the Metaverse offers opportunities to transform their digital presence by making it more fun, informative, and interactive for end users. It is an expansion of the traditional brick-and-mortar store experience and an addition to the omnichannel journey – a marketing and sales channel that enables the engagement of potential customers at all stages of the purchase journey with no physical boundaries. Looking at the Metaverse through the lens of beauty, AR try-ons and virtual shopping are just some examples of how consumers are already interacting with brands and retailers in this virtual world. In an increasingly digital-first environment that rewards short attention spans, it is more important now than ever for brands to find smart and meaningful ways to connect with consumers at every touch point. As a provider of digital solutions for offline and online consumer experiences, Meiyume understands consumer behaviour and is well equipped to help beauty brands enter this new space. “With people now greeted daily by massive streams of information, marketers must understand what their consumers want and successfully harness the right platforms in today’s omnichannel climate to establish deeper connection and brand affinity. We have seen that most consumers are multi-channel customers that use a mixture of human and digital interactions to get what they need from discovery to engagement to product transactions. As a new touchpoint, the Metaverse presents opportunities to reimagine the future of consumer engagement and Meiyume is excited to work with brands to enter this space. Our retail and technology solutions can help beauty companies of all sizes develop interactive digital experiences that can be integrated into consumers’ everyday virtual lives, helping brands connect with their audience more intimately through a seamless product discovery and shopping journey,” said Steve Dodd, Head of Technology and SVP Retail Solutions at Meiyume. In entering the exciting world of the Metaverse, Meiyume has launched their first NFT art, designed to embody the company’s brand personality and philosophy of continuous innovation in creating future-focused products and solutions.

"Symex Mixing Technologies celebrates 25th anniversary, aims for global expansion","Founded in 1997, Symex Mixing Technologies [1] has become the reference in mixing and homogenizing technologies for the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. “We provide high-end equipment to companies that need state-of-the-art technologies for manufacturing products with a high level of quality and we support our customers wherever they are located around the world,” explains Ulf Sieckmann, CEO of the company. The leading names of the cosmetics industry are among the customers of the German company — including L’Oréal, Henkel, Estée Lauder, Dior, etc. — who are interested in its patented technologies allowing full control of the industrial process of mixing and homogenizing cosmetic formulas. “Our technologies include traditional agitation systems, coaxial agitators, rotor-stator homogenisers, as well as rotor-rotor homogenisers - Co-Twister-, and temperature control systems, that allows to perfectly control all the manufacturing parameters and product properties including the size of droplets and particles in the emulsions,” Sieckmann adds. Fully automated, Symex equipment also allows to save significant time during the maintenance and cleaning stages, and offers high flexibility since it can process batches from 10% to 100% of its capacity, with complete reproducibility. Furthermore, sustainability in terms of energy and resources savings are another key advantage of Symex technologies. Cleaning is made place not only faster, but with less water and detergent consumption means also less waste water. A large variety of products, such as skincare creams, sun protection, shampoos, toothpastes, lipsticks, make-up, mascaras and ointments, are currently manufactured around the world using Symex’s equipment. “Our systems can be used whenever there is a need to mix ingredients. The higher the viscosity is the more useful our equipment is,” explains Ulf Sieckmann. Continuously and steadily growing, the company doubled the manufacturing capacity at the end of last year by adding another 2,000 sqm premises including a manufacturing facility and a large office building next to the site built in 2008, for a total investment of around six million euros. Just in time for the largest contract in the company’s history, a 25 million euro order for Japan! The company, which currently employs about 160 staffs, aims to continue expanding globally with “all companies interested in having access to the same level of quality that already Symex provides to industry leaders.” The company has also adapted its technology to dry mixing with a patented rotor-rotor dispersion technology, for all the formulations that do not contain waters, in particular powders for colour cosmetics."
Maison 21G closes series A and expands footprint in Asia,"With a unique O2O (online to offline) bespoke business model, Maison 21G has become the number four brand in perfumery in Singapore; placing the brand just after Chanel, Christian Dior and Jo Malone. The company has achieved this milestone with only three outlets and a unique retail experience with its “Ateliers” (private perfumery workshops). Founded in 2020 by Johanna Monange with the aim to disrupt the fragrance industry and break convention by putting the customers in direct contact with Haute Couture natural essences, Maison 21G has achieved USD 3 million of revenue in 2021. Further down the road this year, Maison 21G aims to simplify its bespoke offer to work with e-commerce partners like Amazon, Lazada, and other distributors to increase its reach. Maison 21G has signed a partnership with Human Wellness, a distributor in Korea, to open a  flagship store in Gangnam along with  a private atelier space in their luxury Spa. “I believe that within three years, our partners in this market will put the brand solidly in the top of luxury perfume brands . Korea is famous for being one of the toughest markets of Asia… but a major trendsetter from which the whole world of beauty takes its cue,” said Johanna Monange. The brand also plans to launch in China in 2022. “Our arrival in China is set to be our biggest challenge. I know my proof of concept in Singapore will be a huge help, but we need to deploy in a very professional way, while not trying to go too fast. We are finalising a huge contract with Eternal Optical Far East, one of the oldest and most famous players in the Chinese perfume industry. Steven Lau was among the first to invest in perfumery and he has stuck to his beliefs from the very beginning. He has various luxury brands like Hermes and Bulgari who believe in his quality of work in retail, and I fell in love with his vice president, Chole, a fantastic woman, empowered, kind and full of energy,” added Monange. In the Middle East, Maison 21G has signed a distribution agreement with Chalhoub group. The new capital will also enable the company to extend its leadership team. “I am hugely proud to announce the arrival of Jacques Gouallou at my side as General Manager of Maison 21G. Jacques was the president of Benefit in Asia and has more than 20 years’ experience in the luxury industries, working with both LVMH and L’Oréal. Jacques will be the catalyst of our ideas and will also attract more skills and talents with his charismatic presence at Maison 21G. It is no exaggeration to say that this is a game-changing talent acquisition for me and my team,” concluded Monange."
Diffulice provides industrial filling in white room,"Initially developed for Body’Minute’s private brand products, the Diffulice packaging centre set up by Jean-Christophe David, the founder of the beauty salon network, offers both Swiss and global brands a secured industrial tool. Diffulice provides filling & capping services for jars, bottles and tubes in compliance with hygiene procedures for white rooms. “We have a very high level of requirement as regards air quality, processes, and machinery. Not many subcontractors offer cosmetics packaging in a white room: it is the poor relation to subcontracting, and yet it is essential. In Switzerland, 80% of cream manufacturing is carried out in a white room; packaging is an asset,” says Jean-Christophe David. In addition, Swiss brands will be able to get the Swisscos origin certification which requires that all manufacturing phases be carried out in Switzerland. Recent installations and production lines are designed for filling any product series, from primary to secondary packaging, and from storage to transport."

"New formulas, new packaging: Caudalie reinforces sustainable commitment","Premium Beauty News - Caudalie has always positioned itself as natural, but as soon as 2006, you went farther, creating a formulation charter to ban several controversial ingredients. What does this approach represent? Angélique Mahot - All our skincare products are created in France in our Natural Formulation Laboratory of the Cosmetic Valley. Every day, our team of formulators surpasses itself to create a new generation of highly natural skincare. The Caudalie products comply with a very strict naturalness charter called Cosm’éthique, which is updated every year for ever-more reasoned and committed cosmetics. In 2006, six substances were removed from our formulas – they were considered as potential endocrine disruptors or they were irritant, derived from petrochemistry, or from ingredients of animal origin – for the benefit of natural ingredients. We have now banned 60, including phthalates, mineral oils, parabens, phenoxyethanol, and sodium laureth sulfate, silicones, PEGs and microplastics. The vast majority of our skincare products are vegan and free from ingredients of animal origin – except for honey and beeswax. Since 2020, we have also undertaken to offer only formulas with at least 95% of ingredients of natural origin (except sun products and Eaux Fraîches) for even more transparency for our consumers. Premium Beauty News - The Clean Beauty market has changed a lot. How is the brand positioned today? Angélique Mahot - The health crisis confirmed what we believed from the very beginning: the future belongs to brands that try to produce sustainable products. Today, being clean is essential. And we were clean much before it became a trend. But today we need to go much farther. Most of our products are based on patented, innovative ingredients developed in partnership with the best research laboratories specialized in anti-ageing, like the Harvard Medical School and Dr David Sinclair, with whom we have worked for 10 years. Premium Beauty News - Have you also revamped your packaging? Angélique Mahot - In 2020, we undertook to change all our packaging so it could be refillable, recycled and/or recyclable. Between 2019 and 2020, we reduced our annual plastic waste by 44.33 tonnes. It represents 1,385,312 1.5-L bottles of water. Our clean commitments go beyond this: we are partners of 1% for the Planet, so over the past ten years, we have given 1% of our turnover to associations that plant trees. At the end of the year, the brand will have planted 10 million! We are the main donor for 1% for the Planet in the French cosmetics industry, and we hope other companies will draw inspiration from us and join the movement. Lastly, in 2020, we created the 100% Plastic Collect programme with Tristan Lecomte. In Thailand, we collect the equivalent of our annual plastic production so it is recycled locally and reused by the local population."
"Harmay, the Chinese company that appeals to investors and beauty enthusiasts","Since opening a first store in 2017, Harmay has sold small-sized products of Chinese and global brands for less than 100 yuans (14 euros). Thanks to an in-house architecture design team, it now owns nine stores in China and counts over 400 employees. “The main reason why capital invests in Harmay is that they have the recipe to attract consumers and especially the GenZ generation,” explains Juliette Duveau, co-founder of consulting agency The Chinese Pulse. She also says that “samples should account for a big part of their total sales”, but that “some consumers will still buy normal size in Harmay because it is a convenient shopping destination for them to collect all the products they want, and they will also pay for the immersive, cool experience to reshare”. The brand does everything it can on social media to pass on the message that store visits are designed to be the most memorable possible. Every Harmay store has its own aesthetic, artistic, and friendly world where buyers can stroll (no shop assistant to help) and even have something to eat. “Harmay offers a coffee space in the ground floor of its Anfu Rd store, they just created their own drink brand @introlemons in 2022,” adds Juliette Duveau. Harmay stores are also contemporary art places. “In addition to co-curating with artists, Harmay also officially launched a support plan for emerging artists, although the exhibition itself is not aiming at generating direct sales, but consumers are more willing to visit and consume in spaces with aesthetic identity”, analyzes Juliette Duveau. The company has announced the funds raised would be used to develop in new categories, strengthen its digital presence with its own application, broaden its brand portfolio, and open stores in Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. Last November, Harmay purchased American makeup brand Kevyn Aucoin. Harmay also stands out with its multiple partnerships and events with high-profile brands like Maison Margiela or Japanese high-end cosmetics brand BAUM, “as Chinese young generation wants to discover more niche and unique brands,” says Juliette Duveau. Harmay recently set up a partnership with Swiss company Firmenich specialized in fragrance and aroma creation to assert itself on the booming Chinese perfume market. According to Euromonitor data, the annual growth rate of this market should reach 22.5% over the next five years. By 2025, perfume sales in China should reach 4.7 billion dollars. “This agreement makes sense, as China is going to be the second biggest fragrance market worldwide”, emphasizes Juliette Duveau. “Chinese young consumers are changing and evolving quickly. Harmay, as a giant multi-brand beauty retailer rooted in China, has a rich knowledge about the local beauty market and young consumers’ preferences in terms of lifestyle and shopping habits. Those assets can help Firmenich to understand better and adapt smartly to the consumers today.” The Chinese media have noticed the emergence of this “sample economy”, a sign that young people are changing the way they consume cosmetics. But they also highlight the absence of regulations on this market, as there are doubts about the origin and authenticity of the samples. Harmay is pointed at for not providing precise information about its supplier chain. “The Harmay critics are mainly relying on its initial business model, which can be considered as a kind of ’grey’ market. Harmay based its initial business model on selling brands’ samples online or by distributing some international brands’ products in a not always ’official’ way,” deciphers Juliette Duveau. However, the expert considers “the switch it operated over the past months in immersive and conceptual retail extension over China contributes to change this image.”"
"""Our line of business must find its place in a desirable future"", Mustela","Premium Beauty News - How is the Mustela brand perceived today? Sophie Robert-Velut - The brand was created in 1950 and has a genuine legacy in terms of recognition and reputation. Both in France and in the countries where we are present. The brand was launched to care for the skin of newborns, with this idea that still drives us today: to be at the side of parents to believe that tomorrow’s world can be a better place. The present must not compromise the future, so our manufacturing activity for children and the family must find its place in a desirable future and guarantee a radically lighter footprint. Premium Beauty News - What are your objectives in terms of brand positioning? Sophie Robert-Velut - To move from the baby care category to a more family-oriented positioning. In our markets, the trend is to consume less but better. There is also a desire on the part of parents, once they have found a brand they like, not only for what it has to offer but also for its societal commitments, to keep using it over a longer period of time and more broadly for all the family members. We are therefore expanding some of our categories, for example, our products for atopic eczema or sun care. Mustela’s organic range, launched at the end of 2019, was initially more positioned as a baby care range, but given that parents have also adopted it, these products are now positioned as family care products. We recently launched our Multi-purpose balm with 3 organic certified avocado extracts, a product for the whole family. I don’t want to over-segment our offer with products only intended for adults. We must not create confusion, our aim is really to cater for the whole family. Premium Beauty News - You have embarked the Mustela brand on a relevant CSR strategy and Laboratoires Expanscience is also B Corp certified, so what concrete actions have you put in place? Sophie Robert-Velut - With this new CSR strategy, our ambition is to become a company with a positive and regenerative impact by 2040. This covers many aspects. We have set ourselves the following objectives: firstly, zero waste by this deadline and, secondly, to contribute to global carbon neutrality by 2030. This commitment includes being in a position to refuse the packs by switching to solids, and to propose ""Reviens"", a range of refillable Mustela products, already in use in pharmacies and drugstores. With this solution, we also want to invite competing brands to join us, because this is a consumer gesture that can only become widespread if several market players are also offering it. The planet should no longer be a competitive issue. We, therefore, want to propose a zero-waste offer for each major useful gesture. For example, at least one washing product will come in a solid or refillable version, the same for atopy or normal skin products, etc. We want the consumer to always have the possibility to choose a product that is better for the planet. Regarding carbon neutrality, we are working on analysing the life cycle of our products, of our ingredients, which play the most important part in our carbon footprint, by securing their sourcing and traceability. We are also trying to increase our use of upcycled ingredients and food co-products. All our portfolio adjustments are moving towards organic or an even higher level of naturalness. Premium Beauty News - And in terms of innovation? Sophie Robert-Velut - Rather than talking about innovation, we prefer to work on the usefulness of the products we put on the market, and on correcting the negative environmental impact of our activity. This goes beyond removing controversial ingredients from our products. It means, for example, also offering a fragrance-free range, or with lighter natural fragrances, even if the Mustela scent remains a Proust’s madeleine. Premium Beauty News - What about your international footprint? Sophie Robert-Velut - We are present in about a hundred countries, with fourteen subsidiaries around the world, in the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Belgium, Russia, and also a Chinese subsidiary, which opened last summer. In this very broad geographical area, there is already a lot to do and we don’t intend to open any new markets for the time being. In Europe, the brand has a strong presence, similar to France, where we have been present for decades. In other countries, Mustela is more considered as a premium brand, which is less well known, although it is progressing very quickly, but with a very qualitative and natural brand image. Our commitments are perceived by parents as being of value. Premium Beauty News - What is your take on this global strategy? Sophie Robert-Velut - Two and a half years ago, we completely revamped our brand platform and worked on a raison d’être based on the empowerment of parents, starting with a change in our communication charter, so that we would no longer talk in a way that could make parents or pregnant women feel guilty. Qualitatively, a new narrative was established. We communicate with a touch of humour and diversity, there are as many good educational systems as there are parents. Today, Mustela has again returned to growth and is gaining market shares in all the countries where the brand is present, in terms of both value and volume."
Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna prepares to reopening to the global community,"After a two-year hiatus, Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna is coming back for an in-person event that will host over 2,700 exhibiting companies, from 71 different countries. The show floor will feature 34 collective pavilions, including 26 country pavilions. ""After two years of virtual events, the business community shows great expectations and excitement for the return of the exhibition in real life"", said Gianpiero Calzolari, President of BolognaFiere. To offer a fitting program of visits and dedicated services to international operators, Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna has increased investments in the Buyer Program, a project that aims to support the participation of selected importers, distributors and wholesalers, and to organize business meetings with exhibitors. Also, the presence of Italian and European large-scale retail chains and perfumeries, as well as distributors and importers from the area of Middle-East and Gulf countries, is encouraged through special projects with media partners and trade associations. To optimize the experience at Cosmoprof and organize business meetings beforehand, Cosmoprof My Match - the digital match-making platform created by Cosmoprof - will offer live chat and virtual tools that facilitate networking between exhibitors and visitors. The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation and ITA - Italian Trade Agency - are offering their support to facilitate the presence of buyers, distributors, importers, and wholesalers from the main markets. Thanks to the funds provided for the extraordinary Made in Italy promotion plan, Cosmoprof is organizing a hospitality program and specific services for selected operators. Recently, a series of new regulatory tools have been adopted to facilitate the access of foreign buyers and exhibitors - including from non-EU countries - to Italian trade shows (more details are available on the Italian Ministry of Health website). In addition to a rich exhibition offer, Cosmoprof and Cosmopack Worldwide Bologna will also be completed by a series of special events and projects. From Thursday to Saturday, the CosmoTalks will offer operators and professionals participating in the show with exclusive conferences and seminars, with the contribution of experts from all over the world. Trend agency Beautystreams will also present its annual CosmoTrends report, analysing the proposals of the exhibitors and highlighting the most impacting trends to date and the developments to expect. Beautystreams will also curate the Cosmoprof & Cosmopack Awards project, celebrating the most innovative proposals and the beauty products with the most significant impact on consumers. In the Cosmopack section of the event, the CosmoFactory will be back too.  This special project brings on the show floor the entire production process of a specific cosmetic product, from the creation of the formula to the filling in dedicated packaging solutions. The eighth edition of the project will present the creation and manufacturing process of ""Six4all"" - a multi-ethnic foundation that combines a neutral base with six shades of colours. The installation will be curated by French-based design agency Centdegrés with the participation of Pink Frogs Cosmetics for the formula of the base and the six shades of colours, Marchesini Group Beauty for the machinery, PennelliFaro with a brush designed specifically for applying the product, Scandolara for the primary packaging, an exclusive aluminium tube, Seriplast A.T. Packaging for the sample size and Gatto Astucci for the secondary packaging - a clutch designed to highlight the quality of the product. The project will involve also Stratasys with its 3D industrial technologies. ""We understand the importance of returning to the event in person. For the 2022 edition, our goal is to offer a top-quality event to stakeholders, with the most suitable services and tools to deal with the new post-pandemic scenario,"" said Enrico Zannini, General Manager of BolognaFiere Cosmoprof."
Gotha Cosmetics takes over majority stake in iColor Group to expand in China,"Gotha Cosmetics sets foot in China through a majority investment in iColor Group, a cosmetic formulation and filling company headquartered in Shanghai. Financial details were not disclosed, but the operation marks a key milestone in the international expansion of the Italian company. Created in 2005, Gotha Cosmetics produces a large variety of color cosmetics with a strong expertise in emulsions and is well known for its innovative face products and liquid lipsticks. The company has solid business background in the US and EMEA [1] Regions. With this transaction Gotha aims to accelerate its growth with local brands in China, as well as to support its current client portfolio in its expansion in Asia through local production. The acquisition will also increase Gotha’s capabilities in turnkey solutions. “Thanks to this acquisition Gotha Cosmetics will strengthen its global footprint and production capacity entering the Asian and specifically Chinese markets, which are experiencing a solid and stable growth. We think that the timing for this transaction is perfect and iColor is the right partner to serve those markets and deliver good products and service. Initial focus will be the local market expansion, keeping the current iColor set up and leveraging meanwhile our Italian expertise in cosmetics,” said Paolo Valsecchi, CEO of Gotha Group. iColor Group provides skincare and make up formulations, product development and filling solutions to local and international brands. They define themselves as a one-stop cosmetics manufacturer that provides product designs, formula research and development, production, processing, sourcing, product record, warehousing and logistics. The company owns production facilities in Suzhou and Shanghai, with more than 40,000 sqm covered surface. The sites integrate R&D, production and filling departments and can process a wide variety of product categories including emulsions, powders and anhydrous formulas."
"Florasis, the startup that upgrades Chinese makeup","In the wake of the ‘guochao’ trend (国潮) which highlights Chinese brands with a strong national identity, this “floral essence nourishing eastern makeup” concept, as defined by the brand, is working quite well. Florasis sales are reported to have reached 3 billion yuans (420 million euros) in 2020, exceeding those of Perfect Diary, the other Chinese makeup unicorn, according to the Chinese press trying to analyze the phenomenon. The same year, on the Tmall marketplace, the Florasis and Perfect Diary (Yatsen group)market shares reached 16.35% and 14.88%, respectively, among makeup brands, according to Daxue Consulting. Most media believe the Florasis breakthrough is due to the partnership with Li Jiaqi, the live-streaming sales star influencer who achieved high scores as soon as 2018 with loose powder and carved lipstick. This close partnership is both a strength and a weakness for the brand, according to 36Kr (36氪), who think it is too dependent from it. On the other hand, the Chinese financial website emphasizes the strong presence of Florasis on all Chinese networks. Products are available on Tmall, JD.com, Vipshop, Pinduoduo, Koala, Xiaohongshu, and Kuaishou. Florasis’s dynamism helped the company enter foreign markets. Tmall reports that on Singles’ Day 2020, consumers from over 100 countries and regions purchased Florasis products on their platform, so that the brand became the best-selling Chinese brand on the global level, all categories included. In March 2021, Florasis arrived on Amazon Japan, where they took advantage of the local craze for “Chinese-style makeup”, a trend the Jing Daily magazine analyses as a sign of a slowdown of Korean and Japanese cosmetics for the benefit of C-Beauty. Last year, Florasis, who sells products directly to consumers, without relying on retailers, was the best-selling beauty brand on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, according to parent company ByteDance’s statistics relayed by the South China Morning Post. The newspaper held by the Alibaba group considers this recent network is still little used by global brands. In China, the Chinese press emphasizes the main difference between Florasis and Perfect Diary in terms of social media and marketing. If Perfect Diary is mainly focused on Xiaohongshu as a main basis, ahead of other platforms, thanks to beauty recommendations and tutorials posted by the first wave of users, Florasis prefers to use live-streaming selling on Taobao. That is where the main difference lies between the two brand positionings: Perfect Diary mainly targets students, urban women living in big cities and small towns, while Florasis is focused on active, cultivated women. In addition, the Florasis range is more limited than Perfect Diary’s, with higher prices. The Florasis loose powder costs about 150 yuans, which ranks it between the 50 to 100 yuans of Perfect Diary and the 250 to 300 yuans of Givenchy, Nars, or Make Up Forever. The fact that Florasis is so successful shows there is an upgrade of Chinese cosmetics brands, which could gradually threaten major historically high-end global brands. The brand puts forward its “R&D team and product development cycle, which lasts one or two years, i.e. longer than some global brands”. However, this feature could be viewed as a handicap on the super reactive, highly competitive makeup market. Also, according to a few marketing experts, another aspect might disadvantage the brand: this 100% DTC (direct-to-consumer) player does not have any physical shop to help develop their sophisticated visual and narrative world."
Roval invests in a full-service solution for bulk hygiene products,"Driven by legislation and consumer demand, bulk products are gaining ground in all hygiene and beauty distribution channels: specialised organic shops, supermarkets, pharmacies and selective channels. According to the research firm YouGov, 76% of French consumers have already bought bulk products, mostly food. Furthermore, 63% of respondents would like to have the opportunity to buy in bulk, the products of major brands that they usually buy in packs [1]. To meet this demand, Roval has been working for several months with Jean Bouteille, a French company specialising in POS liquid bulk distribution systems. The company is already supporting numerous brands and 1400 outlets, including 410 new ones in 2021, in achieving their project. As part of this collaboration, Roval has invested in a high-capacity Bag in Box (BIB) packaging line in 3-litre, 5-litre and 10-litre formats, and is offering its range of conventional, organic and natural washing products, as well as its R&D expertise, for turnkey or customised products. The aim is to offer brands and distributors a full-service bulk solution. The teams at Roval have already validated the compatibility, flow and behaviour tests of formulas at the POS with the most frequently requested product families (shower gels, shampoos). Other formulas will be tested in the coming months. Three turnkey references will be proposed. Roval’s R&D teams are also available to help brands develop custom formulas adapted to this type of distribution. The BIB format proposed by Jean Bouteille and filled in by Roval Cosmétiques can be used for two types of purposes, depending on the brands’ strategy and markets: – The in-store dispensing fountain: The BIB is integrated into the fountain available at the POS. The customer fills the container directly at the shop and reuses it during his next shopping trip. For a complete made in France solution, Roval proposes to use the individual reusable bottles manufactured in its Plastirève factory in Normandy. – The ""Maxi Refill"" size: This packaging is adapted to consumers who prefer an economical and easy to take home, large family size offer. Depending on the needs of brands and retailers, different types of formulas (standard, natural or organic) can be used for all types of hygiene routines: hand, body, hair, shower or bath. Very committed to its CSR policy, Roval received the EcoVadis gold medal in 2021 and improved its CDP rating to B-. The company, which has three production sites in France and one in Spain, is continuing its efforts in this area and intends, with this full-service bulk offer, to facilitate the transition of the entire sector to zero waste."
Cosmoprof Asia relocates to Singapore to renew with face-to-face meetings,"Cosmoprof Asia and Cosmopack Asia are moving from Hong Kong to Singapore this year. “This decision was made after extensive discussions with business leaders, exhibitors and partners who have contributed to the success of the event over the years,” said the organisers in a statement. Actually, the current entry restrictions for travellers to Hong Kong and the “zero-Covid” strategy that remains implemented in China mean that inbound travel to Hong Kong is likely subject to quarantine restrictions in November. Keeping the same dates (16-18 November, 2022), the show will take place at Singapore Expo, a world-class conference and exhibition centre ideally located at the doorstep of the Changi Business Park and close to Changi Singapore Airport. To facilitate the visit, all sectors of the beauty industry - from packaging to finish products - will be gathered in the same venue. “The APAC region remains a crucial reference for global economics, and Cosmoprof Asia is continuing its growth in the area,” said Antonio Bruzzone, General Manager of BolognaFiere Group and Director of Cosmoprof Asia Ltd. “In 2022, Singapore is the best location to welcome stakeholders and professionals again, offering a not-to-be-missed experience to do business in person.” Very well situated in Southeast Asia, Singapore has been selected for its vibrant business environment. It is a well-known global transport hub with one-flight connections from hundreds of cities around the world and has a proven record in facilitating quality events. The city also hosts the regional headquarters of a large numbers of key players in the beauty and personal care industry. Even more important in the current context, while Hong Kong was doubling down on zero-Covid and its international isolation, Singapore opted to live with the coronavirus and reopen to the world. Last but not least, Singapore residents are free to gather in hawker centres or enjoy post-work drinks. As Zoom calls cannot entirely replace the people-to-people connection, the relocation to Singapore was vital for the trade show. The most recent data available showed around 400,000 air passenger arrivals Singapore in December 2021, while Hong Kong saw just 27,000 passengers in that same period. “Our proactive decision to relocate the fair from Hong Kong to Singapore shows our determination to help the industry to reconnect in 2022. We are confident in Singapore’s strong reputation as a preferred destination for business events, and look forward to welcoming our delegates from around the world in the Lion City this November,” said David Bondi, Senior Vice President - Asia of Informa Markets and Director of Cosmoprof Asia Ltd. While waiting to meet each other face-to-face in November 2022, Cosmoprof Asia’s beauty community will have the opportunity to participate to the virtual event Cosmoprof Asia Digital Week, from 27 June to 5 July 2022."
UK’s UpCircle Beauty gives waste a new lease of life,"Every day a bike courier for the skincare brand UpCircle Beauty visits 25 cafes in London and collects some 100 kg (220 pounds) of coffee grounds that would - otherwise - be thrown away. Set up six years ago by Anna Brightman and her brother Will Brightman, UpCircle reuses the coffee grounds to make beauty products, adding ingredients such as camomile infusions or a powder made from olive stones. The siblings took the plunge to set up their own business after working for multinational companies. ""I wanted to do something that was closer to my heart,"" Anna Brightman told AFP. ""It was my brother who had the initial inspiration when asking out of curiosity at the coffee shop where he was going every day what happened to the coffee grounds,"" she said. ""He was shocked to learn the coffee was disposed of at a landfill and they had to pay on top for it."" She joked that she and her brother have since ""made a name (for themselves) as the crazy siblings collecting coffee around London and making cosmetics."" Once the coffee collections got going, ""people started to contact us with all types of by-products,"" Anna said, noting more than 15 of them are now incorporated into their range. Among these are water from making concentrated fruit juices, fading flowers that get thrown away by florists and leftover chai spices. UpCircle pay for some of these ingredients, though the coffee grounds, for example, are free. But the logistics involved in collecting them can be complex and costly. Every year, half a million tonnes of coffee grounds are thrown away in the UK and the firm claims to have recycled 400 tonnes to date. Nevertheless, the idea of marketing a beauty product made from ""trash"" initially got a thumbs-down from industry insiders, Anna Brightman admitted. She said they have to work to get the message across that ""these ingredients we are working with are not gross, old or unclean."" Younger people are ""more open to the idea of the circular economy"", she added. ""For obvious reasons, they are concerned about the future of our planet"". Used coffee grounds work better as a skin care ingredient than dry ones, said Barbara Scott-Atkinson, the formulator for UpCircle’s products. ""It’s been heated and it’s damp. This makes it more suitable to use than plain ground coffee and the level of antioxidants increases."" The company sends the ingredients for repurposing at its factory in Bridport on the southwest coast of England. The smell of citrus essential oils wafts through the factory as they are being used to make a scrub. The production process is simple: coffee grounds are mixed with sugar and essential oils, then whipped shea butter and a natural preservative is added. The exfoliant is then poured into glass jars, 3,000 of which are distributed around the UK every week. Demand is growing rapidly, particularly in the United States, according to the company, which is reluctant to give figures on its sales or growth. The burgeoning interest in repurposing food waste puts Upcircle in competition with other brands of natural cosmetics, such as Britain’s Wildefruit or Australia’s Frank Body, or even the UK giant The Body Shop. As a result, coffee grounds are starting to become sought-after, Anna Brightman said. ""Some cafes tell us they... would like if we could split the week: they get the coffee waste Monday and Tuesday, and us the rest of the week,"" she added. To combat ravaging the planet’s resources, many entrepreneurs and designers around the world are coming up with new ways to create value from waste. Recently, an exhibition called ""Waste Age"" at London’s Design Museum showcased the use of agave, or sisal fibres, by Mexican designer Fernando Laposse, who studied at London’s Central St Martin art school. Laposse turns the natural fibres of the plant — used to make tequila — into avant-garde furniture such as tables, benches and hammocks. He also uses colourful corncobs from his country of birth to make furniture and veneer, helping boost the ""circular economy"" and create jobs. ""In the UK, we recycle 15 percent of our waste, the rest is incinerated or put in landfill"", said the exhibition’s curator Gemma Curtin. The Design Museum exhibition also showed chairs made from old fridges, baskets decorated with fishnets recovered from the ocean and creations by fashion designers, such as Stella McCartney and Phoebe English, who use recycling. Curtin added this prompted visitors to question what is really ""luxury""?"
Blissim aims to become major e-commerce player in Europe,"Sold before being re-purchased to Birchbox by its founders, Quentin Reygrobellet and Martin Labas, the group’s French entity renamed Blissim has focused for two years on growing locally, boosted by the Covid crisis most favourable to e-commerce. “In two years, our turnover rose from 30 to 50 million euros with a continued two-digit growth”, explains Quentin Reygrobellet. Recently freed from the agreement signed with their former shareholder, which prevented them from going global, Blissim now aims to keep developing outside France. To this aim, Raise Investissements, a company founded by Clara Gaymard, joined the pool of shareholders last February 4: it represents a third of Blissim’s capital, alongside the two majority shareholders – the founders – and Otium Capital. “It will help us speed things up in Europe, with Germany on March 1, but also in France: we are one of the first digital players here, but we can still make much progress, overall. Right now, we have three pillars to focus on: the EUR 14.90 box, e-commerce, with retail products, and our private label creation studio, Beauty Story,” says the CEO. To succeed on the German market, the CEO mainly aims to rely on the competitive edge offered by the box. “Germany is a relatively mature market, but our product is affordable. Our box will be the cheapest, the only personalized one, and the only one to be related to e-commerce, so we have access to all major brands,” he says. Just like in France, every month, the boxes will contain a personalized selection of five products of five different brands from the selective or parapharmacies network – professional or niche, mainly clean beauty brands. “At first, we will have a global offering, but we will gradually work with more local brands,” adds Quentin Reygrobellet. “We are very ambitious with the German market, it is one of the main European markets,” he says. For now, Blissim defines itself as the European leader in terms of number of subscribers, with 200,000 people recruited in France only. And the company should grow even more pretty soon, by adding European consumers. As a matter of fact, the German experience should be a major springboard to introduce the concept in the other countries targeted, like Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, and Poland, with one objective: focusing on the local strategy supported by native teams. Following the French model, the box concept is designed to provide brands with a new tool to reach consumers. “Things have changed a lot over the past ten years. Brands have radically changed, putting digital technologies at the core of their global growth strategy. The box has become one of the main communication levers. For example, before Covid, the content of our boxes was determined three to five months beforehand, on average. Now, we are in February, and we have already chosen the December 2022 box,” explains Quentin Reygrobellet. An essential booster, according to the founder, the Blissim box has already appealed to 300 partner brands with very diverse profiles, from the best-established to niche brands, with an increasingly clean offering. Launched three years ago, the Beauty Story studio really took off a year ago, by launching well-established private labels. It was aimed to develop and support brands independently of the Blissim brand, and offer their products through an open retail channel. “Our business is based on data which help us identify consumers’ needs little or not satisfied by brands. Thanks to our box, we also build a bridge between the on and offline worlds to make it possible for customers to test products and catch their attention. With Beauty Story, we use these two assets to create brands with pretty well-asserted universes that can meet these needs,” explains Quentin Reygrobellet. The dozen of brands already released by the studio includes Imparfaite and Glim, available on the Blissim websites, of course, but also at Nocibé, Marionnaud, Beauty Success and Monoprix. “As an example, in 2021, the Imparfaite Radiance Serum was one of the skincare best-sellers on our website. We had anticipated the global boom of the anti-blemish serum category,” he explains."
Eurowipes: Innovative and eco-responsible impregnated products,"With N.E.W., the ANJAC Health & Beauty Group subsidiary offers proven active products derived from a formulation that’s water-free, preservative-free, solvent-free and with no unnecessary excipients. As such, Eurowipes offers natural products combining effectiveness and naturalness (up to 100% according to ISO 16128) that are COSMOS-certified and contain minimal ingredients. Powdered active ingredients are deposited by electrostatic fields in a targeted way onto the product, precisely where needed. In this way, multiple ingredients can be combined and deposited on the product using non-water-soluble active ingredients. As for all the other innovations offered by Eurowipes, the impregnation medium used remains natural and biodegradable, making it possible to develop end products that are 100% compostable at home. ""Through our exclusive partnership with Fibroline, a French engineering company and expert in the development of technologies for depositing all types of powders onto porous products such as textiles, non-woven surfaces, foams and papers, we combine our expertise in ""clean"" formulations with a dry impregnation process for products that are highly active and meet consumer expectations in terms of sustainability,"" explains Virginie Lassagne, Eurowipes Research, Development Projects & Innovation Director. The environmental benefit of this technology is significant, with a dramatic reduction in water transport and the ability to develop a compostable end product while retaining its portable properties. Additionally, for these water-free and solvent-free products, the use of eco-friendly packaging is now possible (for example, a 100% recyclable cardboard box). With this expertise, the possibilities are endless. Eurowipes already offers two new products: 1. The ""Multi-masking"" mask: with several active ingredients that treat each part of the face according to its need.  The mask is dry-impregnated on up to three areas.  As such, the consumer benefits from a purifying treatment for the forehead area, an anti-aging activity for the eye area and a deep moisturizing treatment for the lower face. A true revolution to simplify the beauty routine. Eurowipes’ R&D team supports its customers in the development of other tailor-made ""multi-masking"" concepts adapted to their needs, whether for beauty masks or more broadly for health patches for the pharmaceutical industry. 2. Eco-friendly make-up remover pads! These makeup remover pads use an organic cotton material made from natural biodegradable fibers and are impregnated with active cleansing powders. They’re ready to use and simply need to be moistened with water beforehand. A cutting-edge consumer product: effective, ultra-portable and made with mostly natural ingredients. With N.E.W. Eurowipes, ANJAC Health & Beauty Group offers a high-tech platform with unlimited possibilities for Health and Beauty products adapted to new consumer needs: personalization, efficiency and portability. And of course, a solid response to high expectations for effective eco-responsible solutions!"

Colorprescription: Stimulating imagination with real-life colours,"At a time when algorithms and artificial intelligence have transformed and automated trend forecasts, Sabine Le Chatelier and Claude Vuillermet have chosen to go in the opposite direction by proposing a 100% physical, purely inspirational product, free of any authoritative interpretation. The zero-digital concept of Colorprescription is based on the subjective choices of the two colourists, expressed each year in ten limited-edition boxes of sensory inspiration, each of which is dedicated to a colour, available in different shades and on different substrates. ""It is a 100% physical tool mixing materials and colours. Every month, a colour is selected, developed and applied to various materials. It is a subjective approach whose aim is to provide industrialists and brands, from all sectors, with a real colour shot capable of broadening their horizons, stimulating their creativity and generating new interpretations, and opening their minds to new materials,"" explains Claude Vuillermet. For subscribers, it is also a way to build up a collection of materials classified by colour that will provide the basis for future developments. The two colourists also wanted to break away from the consensual style adopted by trend books, with sometimes strong biases, breaking out of each other’s comfort zones, but also by refusing to impose a preconceived classification. ""We want to inspire without imposing,"" emphasises Sabine Le Chatelier. ""Everything is mobile, detachable, rearrangeable and reusable. There is a notion of freedom in this tool. It’s the ultimate anti-guru,"" she continues. Each box contains a manifesto, an editorial (all texts are bilingual French + English), and a colour chart. Each shade is associated with images and keywords and all the choices are substantiated and contextualised with meaningful images, artistic references, literary words, technical notes or historical accounts which also allow to broaden the scope or, on the contrary, to go into details. All of this is combined with a variety of materials (tinted mouldings, textiles, leather, plastics, ceramics, glass, etc.) which can be vintage or made to order. ""As these are very limited editions, we can afford to carry out very sophisticated research,"" emphasises Claude Vuillermet. Colorprescription is aimed at the sectors of fashion and cosmetics, the industry and decorators and packaging manufacturers. All sectors that have to work with colours and materials and who structure their offer around these subjects! The idea is to inspire colourists, designers, design studios and R&D departments who work with colour ranges, by showing them - upstream of the project process – original, and unusual materials. So far, four boxes have been produced (blue, green, brown, pink) and the white box will be released soon. Each colour is available in four shades. The Colorprescription annual subscription includes 10 editions (published monthly, except in July and August). A one-off or test purchase of a single box is possible: 1 edition: 230 € not incl. tax
6 editions: 1250 € not incl. tax
10 editions: 1970 € not incl. tax Delivery costs in FR and EU included, for orders of 6 or more editions.
It is possible to order past editions (while stocks last). More information on: www.colorprescription.fr"
"Trade shows: Cosmoprof, Esxence and Experience Lab announce new dates","The 53rd edition of Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna has been rescheduled to 28th April to 2nd May 2022 in order to facilitate the in-person attendance of international operators, announced BolognaFiere yesterday. The event was originally scheduled from 10th to 14th March 2022. “The 2022 edition of Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna must be a real support to the cosmetic industry: it is our duty towards the more than 2,700 exhibiting companies confirmed to date, the institutions and associations that continue to make us feel their support, all buyers and distributors who follow our initiatives to develop their business. The decision to postpone the event further to April 28 - May 2, albeit painful, is the result of a responsible dialogue with our players, in order to facilitate the presence of international operators, who can therefore organize the visit to Bologna with greater ease and live their return to Cosmoprof with greater serenity”, explained Gianpiero Calzolari, President of BolognaFiere. “We want Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna 2022 to be accessible to as many operators as possible: this is our contribution to the revitalization of the industry,"" added Enrico Zannini, General Manager of BolognaFiere Cosmoprof. For the same reasons, the organizers of Esxence, the international event dedicated to artistic perfumery, and Experience Lab, dedicated to niche and excellence beauty, that are organized simultaneously at the Milano Convention Centre (MiCo), have announced the trade shows will take place from 15th to 18th June 2022. Both events were originally scheduled to be held from 17th to 20th March 2022. Other events, such as Paris Packaging Week, have also recently been postponed. Given the health situation across Europe and North America, it is not excluded that other postponements will be announced, further burdening the trade show agenda from May to July 2022.

Boosted by online and international sales Cosnova achieves record results,"Online and international sales were the main growth drivers that led to these record results. Cosnova Beauty’s e-commerce business has grown by more than 50% in 2021 compared to last year, and by more than 130% compared to 2019. According to the family-owned company, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, online sales now account for approximately one tenth of global net sales. In addition, Cosnova Beauty performed very well on international markets. Sales grew by 40% in the United States and by 22% in China. “In the USA and China in particular, the strategy of focusing more on online trade and B2C business with e-commerce partners has been very successful,” said the company in a statement. The company also achieved very good results in Western Europe where sales increased by 25%, but the most impressive results were recorded in the Middle East and North Africa region with growth exceeding 50%. “Cosnova remains fully on track for success, despite the tense global situation in another challenging year - which is why we are very pleased with this result,” commented Mathias Delor, Managing Director and COO of Cosnova GmbH. “The global supply bottlenecks also presented us with a major hurdle and we are aware that we could not keep our customers fully satisfied here. Nevertheless, we are proud that the internationalization and digitalization we have been driving forward have contributed to this impressive result, as has our consistent fulfilment of our promise to offer the highest quality at a top price. In the jubilee year 2022, we will continue to expand our position on the market even further.” Last year, the global beauty player focused on expanding its e-commerce business. The aim was to implement a collaborative platform dubbed ’Connected Beauty’ to connect retail, brands and consumers in a new way. “We are very proud that we have completely revamped our online infrastructure in 2021 and have created an innovative brand experience platform with ’Connected Beauty’, which includes engagement, commerce, service, marketing and the brand websites,” said Dirk Lauber, Cosnova’s Chief Digital Officer. Cosnova also invested a lot in digital marketing with the expansion of its social media presence on channels such as Instagram and TikTok. Social commerce, live shopping events and augmented reality tools are on the digital agenda for 2022, with a strong focus on influencer marketing and content production. “These are important strategic topics for us because our marketing distribution channels are almost exclusively digital and we want to take the requirements of the platforms, trends and developments into account,” said Thorsten Mühl, who, as Director Digital Marketing, has been instrumental in shaping the digital transformation at Cosnova since April 2021. Another key element of the company’s growth strategy is the expansion and diversification of its portfolio.  In addition to the Essence and Catrice core businesses, Cosnova will continue to focus on the steady growth of its youngest brands such as L.O.V. or LaManufacture under the umbrella of NextGen Beauty GmbH, a sister company of Cosnova GmbH. The incubator is also working to establish the new Zeena brand in emerging markets this year. The aim is to provide consumers in these markets with decorative cosmetics that meet Cosnova’s quality standards outside the traditional distribution channels."
Unbottled solid cosmetics now in European Sephora stores,"Founded only a year and a half ago, at the beginning of the Covid era, Unbottled quickly reached its public, in particular through social media, and created itself a boosting community: right now, 58,000 people follow the brand on Instagram. Its positioning is inspired from the observations of Sarah Pouchet, the founder, and Benjamin Legros, her associate, regarding sustainability. They aim to remove plastic containers from our bathrooms based on a positive approach and sensorial products. “After six years working for a major cosmetics group, it got clear to me that I wanted to change the system from the inside and develop products free from plastic packaging and as good and pleasant to use as bottled products,” explains Sarah Pouchet. The first three references, a shower gel, a shampoo, and a face cleanser, were launched after a year of R&D. “We realized we actually met a need. Three weeks after the launch, our products were out of stock,” adds the young woman. Eighteen months later, the range counts ten new references, both products and accessories, and most importantly, it is part of Sephora’s selective network: in France since January 4, and in Europe starting from January 17. All in all, the brand will be available in 1,000 stores, as well as on the e-shop. “Sephora gave us the opportunity to be part of a broad distribution network, and we actually aim to reach as many people as possible: the vast majority of people who have started their own ecological transition, pay attention to what they do, but are not ready to use a shampoo with no foam yet. Solid products should not be reserved to the committed happy few. It also shows we help democratize them and we can share the same playground as liquid products,” she concludes. The brand’s latest products include big sizes in the form of breakable tablets, like chocolate, for shower gel and shampoos, with two new perfumes: apricot/shea and neutral for babies. In addition, the range comprises two new shampoos for oily or dry, coloured, curly hair, the normal hair shampoo and shower gel in a miniature version, as well as accessories: a magnetized carrying case and soap holder. The conditioner is expected in February. The formulas are perfumed, can foam, and offer a neutral pH. They are composed of vegetable oils, 100% natural perfumes, and superfood actives. “We reconcile people with solid products thanks to sensoriality. We also aim to remain on the skin and hair care segments, as we want to become a French Lush,” says Sarah Pouchet. After the transient pop-up store opened in November at the Paris Beaugrenelle shopping mall, Unbottled intends to soon increase their physical presence by inaugurating stores in Paris and across the French territory. A modest – first – fundraising campaign launched last Fall helped the brand speed up its development, recruit a whole team, and develop other products."
Anjac acquires majority stake in Apollo and strengthens in North America,"France’s Anjac Health & Beauty, an industrial group specialized in the formulation, manufacturing and filling of cosmetics, medical devices, drugs and food supplements, has completed the acquisition of Apollo Healthcare Corp., a Canada-based company specialized in the development and production of personal care, OTC and wellness products, for CAD 327 million (approximately USD 256 million or EUR 227 million). Based in Ontario, Canada, Apollo Healthcare Corp. is one of the largest private label personal care product manufacturers in North America, developing and manufacturing products for major North American retailers and brands. Apollo’s customer base spans across major North American drug and mass merchandise retailers, users as well as wholesale clubs. The company’s annual turnover surpasses 100 million euros. Apollo Healthcare Corp. has been co-founded by Charles and Richard Wachsberg, who will remain shareholders and co-CEOs. With this acquisition, Anjac Health & Beauty group continues their external growth strategy and further strengthens their footprint in North America, after the acquisition of Cosmetics West in 2019. ""We are very pleased to expand our expertise and technologies throughout the North American continent with this major acquisition. Great opportunities are opening up for our international customers especially when it comes to industrial robustness and innovation!,"" explains Aurélien Chaufour, CEO of Anjac Group. After Cosmetix West and Feltor in 2019, and Roval Cosmétiques in 2020, Anjac signs with Apollo their 8th acquisition within five years. The Anjac Group now gathers 13 companies representing a total of 21 R&D and manufacturing sites and a global turnover which is now twice bigger than three years ago, reaching EUR 600 million, after the new acquisition."
"Chanel launches N°1, a new beauty range that embraces naturality and sustainability","Chanel has just taken a big step in the alliance of luxury and environmental responsibility. The French brand has just announced the launch of a new line of beauty products combining natural ingredients from sustainable sources and more planet-friendly packaging solutions. The red camellia (Camellia japonica), Gabrielle Chanel’s favourite flower, is at the centre of the N°1 line. The ingredient has been selected for its revitalizing and anti-aging properties, particularly for combating the first signs of aging. According to Chanel, the red camellia extract prevents cellular senescence, thereby enabling skin to remain healthy looking for a longer period of time. “Naturally rich in antioxidants, it also helps protect skin from the consequences of stress,” the brand adds. The N°1 de Chanel formulas contain up to 97% ingredients of natural origin (according to ISO 16128 standard). These formulas also include up to 76% of camellia derivatives, with petals, seeds and yeasts used in order not to waste any part of the plant. Through this new line, the French house is also embracing sustainable beauty, with ecologically-conceived packaging. The weight of the jars and bottles has been reduced, through a streamlined design, by minus 30% on average for the entire line, and up to minus 50% for the Revitalizing Cream glass jar. The use of recyclable materials was preferred: 80% of the products in the range are made of glass. The cream jar is refillable. Refilling the Revitalizing Cream twice, therefore allows its greenhouse gas emissions to be reduced by half. The use of plastics was limited, especially single use ones. Cellophane has been removed, as well as paper leaflets, replaced by a QR code. Only organic inks were used to decorate the glass bottles. Inks on the lids have been replaced by in-mould engraving. Lastly, all the product line lids contain recycled or bio-sourced materials. In addition, the Revitalizing Cream lid incorporates camellia seed shells. This innovation is the result of a collaboration between Chanel and Finnish start-up Sulapac. Composed of 90% bio-sourced materials stemming from renewable resources, wood shavings (by-products of the paper industry) and camellia seed shells. Every detail was carefully considered, including: the sensorial qualities of the material, its resistance to heat variations, the unique sound of the jar closing, how it feels in the hand and the depth of the matte satin finish engraved with the iconic double C. Among the flagship products of this new range are a serum, a lotion, several face and eye creams, a powder-to-foam cleanser, a lip and cheek balm, a foundation, and a fragrance mist. The whole range is already available on the Chanel e-shop, before a wider launch from January 15."
Mustela aims to expand its scope to family dermo-cosmetics,"Mustela’s new Multi-Purpose Balm with Three Avocado Extracts promises to nourish, restore and protect any dry areas of the face and body such as the neck, arms, hands, elbows, knees, feet, lips and cuticles. With this launch, the Expanscience Group’s brand, known for its expertise in the baby and child care products, wants to open a new chapter in its history by building on the its expertise in skin care and plant extraction to expand its scope to skin and body care products for the entire family. For this first foray into family cosmetics, Mustela has developed a multi-purpose product, presented as ""an easy way to consume better"" through a reduction in the number of products in the bathroom while making life easier for parents. ""This product is emblematic of our commitments and our know-how"", explains Clémence Menez, Marketing Director Mustela France. A B Corp certified company since 2018, a label awarded to businesses that balance purpose and profit, Mustela has crafted the product using the emblematic ingredient of the Expanscience group: Peru’s organic avocado upcycled from the agro-food industry byproducts. Certified organic by Ecocert, the balm contains 99.7% of natural ingredients and is EWG Verified, meaning that it is free from any ingredients of concern as defined by the Environmental Working Group (EWG). It contains no perfume or dye, its colour and smell being naturally given by avocados. ""The avocado is the star of this product, it is a fruit with high nutritional values, studied and used by Mustela for many years. It provides the balm with three complementary substances: fats, derived from oil, rare sugars, some of which the avocado is one of the rare fruits to contain, and antioxidant polyphenols”, underlines Sophie Leclere-Bienfait, Director of Innovation and Research and Development on Active & Natural Ingredients. Supplied from sources assessed by the UEBT, the avocados are transformed at the Expanscience plant in Peru thanks to patented processes. Then, the ingredients are shipped to France where they will be used in many of the group’s products, including the new Baume Universel. ""Transforming avocados where they are produced not only helps to preserve their qualities but also limits the environmental impact of the entire process, by limiting the volumes that are shipped"", adds Maëla Le Mercier-Pinier, Mustela Product Manager at Laboratoires Expanscience. The Multi-Purpose Balm with Three Avocado Extracts comes in an aluminium tube, a material that has been preferred to plastic for its ability to be infinitely recycled. ""For the moment, we are using virgin aluminium, but we are in full swing to find a way to use recycled aluminium tubes for even more circularity,"" says Mustela in a statement. According to the brand, another advantage of aluminium is that  it can be bended thus allowing maximum formula delivery (up to 10% more product compared to a conventional plastic tube). The first product in the brand’s new family range, which will have a specific logo and packaging, Multi-Purpose Balm with Three Avocado Extracts was launched in France at the end of last year."
Proverb Skin moves to eco-friendly packaging with compostable paper pouches,"Proverb Skin’s skincare trial samples are now available in paper home compostable sachets, a world first, according to the company. In addition, their best selling Cleanse & Shave Nutrient Mud and Energising Facial Scrub now have new aluminium packaging. According to the brand, the process of filling a liquid serum into paper pouches was a mammoth ordeal that required a two year-long testing process. The pouches are composed of layers of paper and biofilm from wood pulp cellulose ensuring they are 100% plastic-free. They are designed to home compost at ambient temperatures back into the water, CO2 and biomass without having any ecotoxicity for the soil. “To date, nobody has held an emulsion in a paper-based pouch that will home compost,” claims the Proverb Skin. The new sample pouches are available to consumers that would like to try the skincare collection before they purchase the full sizes, and are fully home compostable in 26 weeks. The choice of eco-friendly packaging is in line with Proverb Skin’s DNA. For their formulas, the brand makes sure to only ever use natural and organic ingredients. The new launch aluminium tube, Energising Face Scrub, for instance, has reclaimed blitzed avocado stone and coconut shell as a natural exfoliant. “Next year, we are hoping to bring out our entire skincare range in a one-time purchase glass bottle that can be refilled with our compostable skincare pouches,” announced Proverb co-founder, Kirstie Sherriff."
Olfactory creation: Cinquième Sens combines freedom and creativity,"Like the collections of fashion houses, each year the Creative Week explores various themes (Green Week, African Week, Kitsch Week, Bright Week...). A way of keeping up with the times while prescribing future trends. This year, Cinquième Sens [1] gave its perfumers carte blanche to stage the concept of freedom using fragrances. With this in mind, Sarah Burri, Camille Leguay, Alice Dattée, Veronika Rebeka Nagy and Isabelle Ferrand unleashed their imagination to focus on three creative themes: liberation, evolution and escapism. With the notion of liberation, the idea was to harness the perfumer’s skills to give voice to silent flowers. These ""forgotten"" ingredients, which never appear on the perfume organ because their scent cannot be extracted using classical methods. Hence, Isabelle Ferrand imagined the fragrance reminiscent of a wheat flower: a powdery, vegetal, dusty scent, which she transcribed with transparent, abstract, honeyed floral notes to express the idea of light and sunshine, but also with iris, violet, cedar and sandalwood. The second celebrates evolution, as a passage towards a new era. Veronika Rebeka Nagy wanted to release fougere from the men’s wardrobe and take it to more feminine or androgynous lands. Moving away from the fougere note’s classic lavender-coumarin structure, she emphasised geranium, vetiver and evernyl. Naturally, this gives the composition a very herbaceous dimension revolving around myrtle, with a coumalactone base note, a non-allergenic substitute for coumarin, but with a milkier roundness. The last stage is escapism, to free ourselves from the notions of space-time and the laws of physics. Cumulus, for example, transports us to the sky, through a vaporous, airy, cottony fragrance, conjuring up those big clouds synonymous with warm weather. A mix of milky, powdery notes and an ozonic, almost cold side. The powdery, almost talcum powder accord emerges in the background, with this ""clean"" facet currently very trendy in perfumes. In total, no less than nine perfumes, on the wide-ranging theme of freedom, were created for this event. Cinquième Sens once again surrounded itself with partners to stage its Creative Week. This year, Jérémy Tamen, a tea expert, concocted a bespoke infusion for the event. A combination of natural, zesty and herbaceous notes, translating his vision of freedom: that of a walk around the Mediterranean. The team also worked with Les Parfumables, which presented new olfactory substrates in the form of a container made from a 100% biodegradable wood-based alternative to plastic, produced by the Finnish company Sulapac. An annual event, which confirmed that Cinquième Sens masters both the art of creation and the expertise of training."
Anjac: “An ambitious CSR strategy for the next five years”,"It has been a little more than a year since our last interview. Can you tell us about any developments in your CSR at Anjac? Aurélien Chaufour - The Anjac Group and I have very strong convictions and place a high value on CSR. After three years of fast-paced acquisitions, I wanted us to accelerate our actions and push for synergy across the companies. Also, this year, with our 12 companies we co-constructed an ambitious and very concrete CSR strategy for the next five years. Our goal is to continue to move forward quickly in order to create value for our customers and territories where safety, health, and the environment are the number one priorities. Does innovation still have a role in your CSR strategy? Aurélien Chaufour -  More than ever! Innovation is a constant driving force, and I believe it greatly motivates the products and services we offer. Not only does it encourage more environmental sustainability, but it also places the focus on consumer health and regional benefits. CSR lead to challenges, but above all, it creates value for our industries and companies. Innovation is the cornerstone of our group’s CSR strategy. I can already proudly tell you that 90% of the innovations from our own R&D relate to sustainability. This is the result of many years of work by our R&D teams. The Anjac Green Attack innovation program guides our internal actions toward sustainable innovations affecting formulas, processes, and packaging. Solid cosmetics, certified household compostability, a natural approach, natural health... the achievements are numerous. And our R&D committee is working to take it even further... Our Responsible Purchasing policy goes hand in hand with our goals. Anjac has begun working with our top suppliers through EcoVadis, an internationally recognized rating system. On what actions is your CSR strategy based and how is it implemented within your companies? Aurélien Chaufour -  Innovation is the first pillar. Then we chose very concrete and pragmatic actions that allow us to involve all the teams and businesses. CSR is everyone’s business. We need to build an industrial model that combines sustainability and performance. This involves eco-efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at our manufacturing sites. We have set our objectives for the next five years, and we can share them with our clients with full transparency. The ECOVADIS rating, which covers the full 360° vision of an integrated CSR approach, helps us measure our progress and creates a challenge for each of our sites. Already in 2021, we have reached a milestone, with 51% of the group’s sales achieving a GOLD medal rating. We set a goal for ourselves to achieve Gold across the board within five years, so why not go for Platinum! What about your social and societal actions? Aurélien Chaufour -  Obviously, all of this progress is possible thanks to our teams, who are highly motivated by their impact on people. We prioritize safety, along with autonomous, pressure-free team development, always encouraging the group’s entrepreneurial spirit. Our ""Zero Accident"" policy is a priority, deployed at each of the group’s sites. Our societal commitment reflects our values and our activities in our territories. Human and Health, in its entirety, does a good job of summing up what is most important to us. We support the Gustave Roussy Hospital, Europe’s #1 children’s cancer center, CEW, the cosmetics industry’s top-ranked network providing beauty care for hospital patients; EPIC, with its Prerana and Agir pour l’École associations; and the Maison des Femmes, a unique medical-social structural model providing care and assistance to women who are victims of violence. And obviously, we place great importance on universal access to daily care, which is why we regularly donate products, an action we’ve found to be very effective. Is there anything else you’d like to tell us before we go? Aurélien Chaufour -  The Anjac Group demonstrates its customers clear ambitions and CSR objectives, driven by innovation. This marks a new stage in our development. We’re on our way to actively contribute to the transformation of our Health and Beauty industries. Source : (www.anjac.com)"

Chanel’s first Advent calendar trapped in a bad buzz turmoil,"For cosmetics brands, advent calendars are a good way to draw attention during the pre-Christmas period while inviting their consumers to test a large array of new products. Advent calendars have multiplied at breakneck speed in recent years, with some brands even offering up to three or four different calendars. 
Let us guide you to the best online slot games - slots-online-canada.ca and some of our favorite casinos where you can play these slot machines.
Beyond the magics behind these boxes, consumers usually get their money’s worth as well, whether it’s because they’re testing new products, or because they get content that has an overall greater retail value than the price of the package. Indeed, it’s a sales argument put forth for most of the products presented to the public. For instance the Body Shop offers a calendar for US$79 which is actually worth US$132.59 when buying each products separately. Sephora’s calendar is sold at US$45 while it contains products for a value of US$102 at retail price. And Lookfantastic’s US$135 calendar would contain US$640 worth of products. If Chanel had until then stayed away from the movement, the first advent calendar of the French luxury house, which represents a giant bottle of n°5, its iconic century-old perfume, has been at the centre of conversations on social networks for a few days now. It all started on TikTok, with several posts influencer Elise Harmon, followed by some 250,000 subscribers. After having started to opening, day after day, the boxes of her luxurious calendar, the young woman began to share her disappointment. Miniature versions of collector perfumes, lipsticks, hand creams: the brand’s calendar has a host of objects that beauty fans dream about but it also contains pins, stickers, pouches, and decorative Christmas baubles that - according to some commenters - Chanel would generally offer free to its customers when they purchase a certain product. Considering the price of the calendar, consumers expected classics, albeit in small formats, rather than trinkets. However, the brand was fully transparent, providing a detailed list of all the contents of the calendar. According to the count made by ETX Studio, among the most valuable ’gifts’ are the N°5 Eau de Parfum Spray 1.2 fl. oz. (85 dollars), N°5 L’EAU On Hand Cream (55 dollars), N°5 The Bath Soap 2.6 oz. (26 dollars), limited edition Rouge Allure lipstick (45 dollars), LE VERNIS nail polish (28 dollars), a miniature Rouge Allure lipstick plus several miniature collector perfume bottles whose value is hard to identify. This makes a total of about 250-350 dollars, including miniatures. Of course that’s without counting the various bracelets, mirrors, pouches, snow globe and other accessories. Commenting on the controversy, Bruno Pavlovsky, Chanel’s Fashion President told WWD that: “This controversy is a bit of a shame because it was not what Chanel intended. Chanel thought it would please some of its customers by offering this type of product. Evidently, we see that you have to be careful and therefore, in future, we will certainly be much more cautious.” He explained the calendar was produced in very limited run as part of this year’s celebrations of the 100th anniversary of Chanel No.5 perfume, and that it was totally sold out. In an official statement, Chanel said they were “aware of the comments that are currently visible under our publications and are sorry that this calendar may have disappointed some people.” “Directly inspired by the mythical silhouette of the No.5 bottle, this calendar, only available for a short period, has a unique design and an original content, which makes it a true collector’s item whose value cannot be summed up by the products it contains alone,” the brand added."
"""It’s a strong, committed and creative relaunch"", Jean Jacques, Parfums Caron","Premium Beauty News - How does your duo operate with Ariane de Rothschild? Jean Jacques - Ariane de Rothschild is very involved, she is passionate about perfumes, and she is a true entrepreneur. If you look at the history of Caron, the most creative period are the 40 years spanning from 1904 to 1941, during which Ernest Daltroff, the founder, was at the helm of the company. At that time, there was an explosion of creativity, a desire to surprise and audacity. Ariane brought all this back to life with her energy and her desire to undertake, her way of always finding new ideas. She is a woman full of liberating energy. Beyond the means that will allow beautiful things to be done, she instils a creative dynamic. Caron was Daltroff’s Perfume House, but also Félicie Wanpouille’s House. He was the olfactory creator, she was his business partner and muse. This duo is reincarnated today with Ariane and me. A new creative duo. Premium Beauty News - A fruitful collaboration? Jean Jacques - In two years, we have already launched fourteen perfumes. There are also many projects underway for next year and a 2023 collection, which is very relevant and daring. A lot is going on. There is a desire to show that something is happening in this brand. It’s really a strong, committed and creative relaunch, driven by passion. Premium Beauty News - What characterises the Caron olfactory signature? Jean Jacques - An overdose of naturals. When you put 10% of sustainable vetiver in Aimez moi comme je suis, it’s truely the House’s signature. In Pour Un Homme it’s almost 61% natural lavender, which is unique in selective perfumery. For Poivre Sacré and Poivre Imperial, I started from the same premise as Parfum Sacré, created in the 1990s, which was one of the first women’s fragrances to contain an overdose of pepper essence, i.e. 6%. Poivre Sacré is a sulphurous, powerful, spicy pepper, with the same postulate of 6% pepper essence. On the creative side, I also inspire myself of the history of the House, which is based on this idea of unexpected duality, like the meeting between Daltroff and Wampouille, but also the lavender and vanilla duo in Pour Un Homme, or the duo between Ariane and me today. I compose my perfumes around this idea of an explosive encounter between two ingredients that are not meant to go together and that finally work well, like vetiver and hazelnut in Aimez Moi Comme Je Suis or tuberose and ginger in Tubéreuse Merveilleuse. Premium Beauty News - How is the brand doing after these two years? Jean Jacques - There is still a lot to be done but there are very positive signs. The boutique in Paris is still going strong. We are opening new markets, the Middle East where we are fully legitimate with our powerful fragrances, and Asia where, although the appetite is more for fresh fragrances, we are surprised to see that signature and powerful fragrances also perform well. Overall, people have a positive expectation regarding the brand. There is a kind of fond tenderness. We all know someone who has worn a Caron perfume, even in foreign markets. So there’s no reason why we shouldn’t keep offering the things we’re best at. Premium Beauty News - And what about France? Jean Jacques - People realise that something is going on even if of course, not everyone has come to the same conclusions. Aimez Moi Comme Je Suis was launched in 2020 amid Covid, but it’s a perfume that catches people’s attention when they simply cross someone wearing it. Once they have smelled it, people love it. In our boutique, it is our second sale and the first in the Middle East. It’s making its way, but we have to continue to be very creative, to be in our role as a Maison de Parfumerie, created by a Perfumer, experimenting, taking chances so that our fragrances can be discovered by more customers. I have the feeling that the first signs are already there."
"On The Wild Side, wild cosmetics made in France","Premium Beauty News - On The Wild Side offers natural products, but with specific commitments? Anne-Sophie Nardy - Our products are certified organic and made from 100% natural ingredients. We use no ingredients derived from petrochemicals. Unlike other natural brands, we do not use essential oils as they can be irritating. Finally, the brand’s DNA lies in the use of wild plants harvested in collaboration with a cooperative of gatherers. Birch sap and beech buds, for example, come from forests in the Gironde and the Massif Central regions. Because they result from a long natural evolution, grow with no protection and interact with an often difficult environment, wild plants are richer in active ingredients. Tests have shown them to be very effective in regenerating the skin, improving hydration and reducing oxidative stress. Premium Beauty News - Why a cooperative of gatherers? Anne-Sophie Nardy - On The Wild Side wants to stand for committed cosmetics. We strive to be more than just another cosmetic brand, by taking part in local actions that change the world and raise awareness. It was, therefore, important to work with truly knowledgeable people who love plants and respect the natural environment. Since January, I have been actively involved in the AFC, (Association française des professionnels de la cueillette de plantes sauvages, or French association of wild plant gatherers), whose mission is to promote the trade of wild plant gatherers and to develop responsible and sustainable gathering practices. Gathering is an ancestral practice but, like agriculture, it can have an impact on ecosystems. It is therefore important to define good practices: how to pick the plant, at what season, how much and with what tools... Premium Beauty News - In concrete terms, how does this translate into your range? Anne-Sophie Nardy - We offer six face care products, including a cleansing oil, a day cream and a care oil. We complemented our range with two hair care products in July. The range also includes a food supplement for nails and hair in capsule form, and a relaxing night concentrate, in the form of drops to be mixed in a glass of water. We launched five new products this year, and there are more to come next year. Premium Beauty News – And in terms of packaging, how is this commitment reflected? Anne-Sophie Nardy - All of our containers are recyclable: in glass or aluminium. For our secondary packaging, we use FSC managed cardboard. We are considering integrating refills next year for the glass containers. Premium Beauty News - Where are the products available? Anne-Sophie Nardy - Initially, products were only available online, via our e-commerce site. Questionnaires for our community via Instagram and on our website, helped us to better understand their expectations. Distribution was gradually extended to marketplaces and physical outlets. The brand is now present in 500 POS: department stores such as Le Printemps, Galeries Lafayette and La Samaritaine, but also at Sephora for a year and a half, online and in retail in twelve countries in Europe, and in concept stores such as Merci, for example. Today we are looking to consolidate our presence in these POS, and to extend our presence internationally. We are going to open a new market in an Asian country, via e-commerce and physical outlets. Premium Beauty News - What are the next steps for the brand? Anne-Sophie Nardy - We raised 500,000 euros in 2020 from business angels. This allowed us to recruit, launch our new products and improve our notoriety, with a manifesto film and a poster campaign in the streets of Paris. We are going to continue our current strategy by completing our offer, with relevant products for our customers while sticking to our formulation charter. We want to consolidate our international foothold and further develop our community through social networks like Instagram. We are also aiming for the B Corp certification in 2022."
Beauté Privée intends to boost its development with a more premium positioning,"Founded about ten years ago, Beauté Privée is now a leading pure player in the field of beauty. With 250,000 daily visits, 90% of which are on mobile phones and 70% via the app., the platform has recorded a 24% average annual growth rate since its acquisition by Showroom Privé two years ago. Riding the e-commerce wave, the parent group now intends to capitalise on this momentum and has embarked on a technical and marketing overhaul of the site and the application. ""The Showroomprivé Group strongly believes in the value of this platform,"" comments Aurélie Bouvart, Marketing Director. ""This brand strategy is completely independent of the Group but is integrated into its DNA. We are reaching out to women and we are talking about immediately accessible wellness products,"" she adds. The new positioning, developed with the Marcel Agency, is based on the notions of partnership, accessibility and well-being. With the slogan ""Beauté Privée après vous, votre meilleur allié pour se faire du bien"" (Beauté Privée, after you, your best ally to care for yourself), a vast communication campaign was launched in October with the aim of establishing the brand’s new identity. To convince users, Beauté Privée is counting on a richer and cleaner offer. The site currently has 1,000 partner brands, including 200 new ones since the beginning of the year, and plans to double that figure in the next two years. ""We have a very comprehensive catalogue that we intend to develop to fulfil our mission of making beauty accessible to all beauties,"" declares Aurélie Bouvart. The wide-ranging recruitment of new brands is aimed at major groups but also clean beauty indie brands, a growing category according to the Manager. ""Nearly a quarter of our references come from the green section, which for us, covers organic, natural, vegan, made in France and zero waste products. We are trying to facilitate access to responsible consumption since these references are offered with an average discount of around 43.5%,"" she continues. At the same time, Look Forward, the incubator of the Showroomprivé Group supports fashion and beauty start-ups with a committed profile, such as for beauty: 900 Care, Unbottle, All Tigers and Beautymix. Customer experience has also been revamped by making the application and website more user-friendly. ""We have worked on making navigation lighter, to create a more premium user experience. The idea is also to provide the customer with additional advice on how to discover new products,"" explains the manager. Beauté Privée covers exclusively France at the moment but is interested in looking at business opportunities outside France."

India beauty retailer Nykaa sees valuation surge to $13 billion after IPO,"Founded in 2012 by former investment banker Falguni Nayar, Nykaa has grown into India’s top e-commerce site for beauty products, with strategic endorsements from Bollywood stars and support among twenty-somethings. The company now offers more than 2,500 beauty brands, from makeup to skincare products, fragrances and other personal care products, through its websites, apps and some 80 brick-and-mortar stores. ""I hope the Nykaa journey — an Indian-born, Indian-owned and Indian-managed dream-come-true — can inspire each of you,"" Nayar said at the listing ceremony on Wednesday. Nykaa (the Sanskrit word for actress) quickly became popular with young tech-savvy Indians — predominantly women — who preferred the wide selection of brands compared with what was on offer at their local shops. ""The best part about Nykaa is that it lets me access so many global brands that had never been sold in India before,"" 30-year-old loyal customer Sanaeya told AFP. ""They have everything from major luxury brands to smaller niche ones and even lesser-known Korean skin care products. I always find something new there.” Nayar, 58, joined only six other Indian women dollar billionaires as Nykaa’s parent company FSN floated on the Mumbai stock exchange, hitting a valuation of 1 trillion rupees ($13.5 billion) in the first five minutes of trade. The company has said the IPO proceeds will be used for a range of strategical corporate purposes, including investing in FSN Brands or setting up new retail stores. Bollywood actress Katrina Kaif has invested in the firm — helped cement Nykaa’s popularity as it battles giants such as Amazon and Flipkart. Nykaa has also manufactured its own in-house brand of products since 2015 and recently began selling clothes and household products. It has a growing high street presence with 80 stores across 40 Indian cities. The retailer expects India’s beauty and personal care market to nearly double in size from 2020 to 2025, reaching nearly 2 trillion rupees. Even after selling 4.8 million shares via the IPO, Nayar — along with her husband and twin children — continues to own more than half of the company, valuing her stake at $7 billion. Nykaa’s three-day IPO was over-subscribed by nearly 82 times, signalling strong investor demand for a start-up that has already achieved profitability. Technology start-ups in India have attracted record investment this year, with more than 33 ""unicorns"" — companies valued at more than $1 billion — created, benefiting from investors spooked by a crackdown on technology giants in China. Others going public this year include food delivery giant Zomato, whose shares have since risen 80 percent, and mobile payments pioneer Paytm which is conducting its IPO — India’s biggest — this week. But unlike many of its loss-making peers, Nykaa is profitable."
"With its Eau de Parfum Naturelle, Chloé is starting a trend in selective perfumery","Premium Beauty News - How was Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle born? Karole Stanislas - This new addition is part of the sustainable development approach that has been driving Chloé for several years. And more particularly since the arrival, a year ago, of our new Creative Director, Gabriela Hearst, who advocates an ethical and responsible fashion. The brand’s latest fashion show during the Fashion Week demonstrates this. Furthermore, this approach also draws on the DNA of Chloé, a brand that has always emphasised natural and authentic femininity (""the most naturally feminine fashion brand""). Premium Beauty News - Does this launch reflect a quest for naturalness among consumers? Karole Stanislas - This project is first and foremost a reflection of my holistic vision of consumption. But also my conviction that people are looking for ""cleaner"" or natural products. The health crisis also helped to bring this project to fruition and finished convincing perfume houses. Indeed, it was quite challenging to impose this launch, the industry was reluctant, mostly for technical reasons related to the sillage and the staying power of the perfume. That said, even if I believe this trend is real, no study really supports it. Moreover, it varies from one country or market to another. But you only have to look at the beauty shelves to see for yourself. Premium Beauty News - What is your take on the natural trend in perfumery? Karole Stanislas - I think that consumers see natural products as a token of confidence, particularly in terms of health, rightly or wrongly so. But there are two obstacles to this trend: on the one hand, a strong industry lobby, and on the other, the fact that it is an expensive choice. I think we need to strike a balance in terms of formulation. There are many contradictory studies on the subject. On the one hand, petrochemical endocrine disruptors are stigmatised. On the other, natural resources are not inexhaustible, ecologically speaking. This is why perfume houses are developing sustainable materials or ingredients from upcycling. In my opinion, green chemistry is a response to this complex issue, which is very topical at Coty. Premium Beauty News - What brief did you give to the Perfumer Michel Almairac for this new product? Karole Stanislas - Behind the brief, there was a desire to reinterpret the signature fragrance by giving it a new facet, with this creative requirement. We wanted the fragrance to give off this naturalness, olfactively, as clear evidence. Through green facets in particular, which express this idea of nature, of a garden in bloom. Premium Beauty News - This Eau de parfum is composed of ""100% natural"" ingredients. Can you tell us more from a technical point of view? Karole Stanislas - Perfumer Michel Almairac worked with beautiful natural materials (rose, citron, neroli and cedar), coming from organic farming and eco-responsible channels. In this respect, the brand was determined to be transparent. This formula also includes isolates, which are molecules extracted from a plant via a chemical process, provided that they contain more than 50% renewable carbon. I wasn’t involved in the creative process, but the renewable materials that perfume houses - in this case, Robertet - have been developing recently were also a challenge. Premium Beauty News - You are the first major brand to offer a ""natural"" Eau de parfum. Is this a turning point for the future of perfumery? Karole Stanislas - The craze for this type of perfumery is real, but I am not sure that it will become a trend of its own in the selective segment. Perfumers are indeed more and more approached for this type of project, which demonstrates the public’s expectations. But I don’t think that all the big brands are ready to take the step. It is a delicate subject, which comes up against the strong industry lobby and the lack of transparency surrounding the formulation. The choice of natural, high-quality materials is also expensive. The trend towards ""naturals"" is already well established in the beauty care or niche perfumery sectors. It is now taking its first steps in the selective sector, as part of a global ecological awareness. Indeed, big brands are increasingly launching initiatives to use ""cleaner"" or eco-responsible materials. It remains to be seen how green chemistry can reshape the perfumery of tomorrow."
"L’Odaïtès, a family adventure and ""a real feast for the skin""","Before being a cosmetics brand, L’Odaïtès is first and foremost a story of family transmission and legacy. Nabilla Chemillier, Co-founder and General Manager of the brand, and her two sisters, also involved in the adventure, grew up with their grandmother, a pharmacist. Between picking plants in orchards and gardens, distilling floral waters and preparing essential oils, they discovered the practices of the Mediterranean apothecary tradition and learned various traditional skincare techniques. Each of the three sisters has expertise in a different field: Alya owns a pharmaceutical laboratory while Sofia is a chemist, and Nabila used to work in statistics and accounting. When their grandmother passed away, they decided to carry on her savoir-faire. ""We wanted to keep the same rigorous quality approach in terms of raw materials, hence the exclusive use of cold-pressed or extracted active ingredients to preserve their biological richness,"" explains Nabila Chemillier. This is how the three sisters joined forces to found L’Odaïtès. The name of the brand, created in 2015, is a reference-tribute to this legacy, via Daïtes, the Greek god who invented feasting. ""Our products are designed to offer a feast to the skin and make a nod to dates, the emblematic fruit of the Mediterranean basin,"" explains the Manager. Cold extraction is one of the founding principles of the brand. This process ensures that the biological richness of raw materials is preserved as much as possible. ""We work with virgin vegetable oils, even if they are difficult to stabilise. We also focus on the packaging to preserve the finished product in the bottle as much as possible."" This is why the brand has chosen brown glass bottles, which are more efficient in protecting the product from light, or airless containers, which protect sensitive actives from oxidation. Another founding element of the brand is the choice of active ingredients from the Mediterranean basin, particularly from desert areas, such as dates. ""It is an unparalleled ingredient, the sap is extremely rich in polyphenols, its ORAC index is 3 times higher than that of grapes,"" stresses Nabila Chemillier. The date also contains many trace elements and polysaccharides to boost cell communication for a radiant complexion. The stone of the date is also used. Transformed into oil and powder, which is excellent for exfoliation. In the end, this fruit is used in five products of the L’Odaïtès range. Like neroli, orange blossom essential oil is one of the brand’s flagship ingredients, both as an active ingredient and olfactory signature. Finally, following the practices of their grandmother, the three sisters wanted to create a brand that was as natural as possible. ""From the outset, a lot of work had to be done to formulate with natural preservatives, 100% plant-based emulsifiers, natural stabilisers, etc., in perfect adequacy with our choice of noble botanical raw materials."" Right from the start, the brand has been committed to educating consumers, particularly about the difference between virgin and refined oils. For L’Odaïtès, it is this choice that ultimately comes first, before choosing between organic or conventional oil, because, unlike refined oil, virgin oil will be packed with all its nutrients (essential fatty acids, vitamins, etc.) and will therefore bring real benefits to the skin. But choosing fresh ingredients and limiting preservatives comes at a price! ""A virgin oil is twice as expensive as a refined oil,"" explains Nabila Chemillier. Thus resulting in a top-of-the-range positioning and a distribution targeting specialised outlets. ""We have given priority to niche perfumeries, spas and apothecary-type pharmacies."" Proud to be made in France, L’Odaïtès is now distributed in a hundred or so outlets, mainly in Europe, especially in France and Italy, but also in the United States, on the coast via a local distributor, and in Morocco and Senegal. For an indie brand, distribution is a major challenge and the key to success, especially in France where retail sales are highly concentrated, particularly in the selective circuit. To broaden its offer and meet current expectations, the brand will launch a food supplement at the end of the year. A face serum is also in preparation for next year. ""After the lock-downs, consumers have somewhat abandoned make-up in favour of skincare. They are no longer trying to conceal their wrinkles and are looking for a radiant and luminous complexion, by using either cosmetics or food supplements,"" points out the General Manager."
"Following Singapore, Maison 21G bespoke perfumes go global","Has Johanna Monange found the formula that will finally bring luxury perfumery into the new millennium? By combining quality ingredients, personalisation, accessibility, digital and experiential, she has succeeded in fulfilling the key expectations of young consumers with a brand that is refined, luxurious, without being haughty... And the success is there with a dazzling expansion! Today, the brand has three outlets in Singapore’s most prestigious locations: after opening a boutique in the chic Duxton district, Maison 21G entered the luxurious Marina Bay Sands shopping centre in July, before recently moving to the Takashimaya Shopping Centre on Orchard Road. On the export front, the brand has already established itself in Hong Kong, Australia and Thailand, and is about to make its debut in the Middle East, with the support of the Chalhoub Group, and in the United States at Bloomingdale’s. The next stop for the brand, is China of course, where growth rates in niche perfumery are skyrocketing, with plans for a boutique opening as early as 2022, then probably Europe, with a boutique in Paris in 2023. But the priority remains Asia, where Maison 21G believes it is well placed to meet the strong demand for quality and original fragrances from the younger generation. Like others, Johanna Monange, founder and CEO of the young brand, has observed the disruption of make-up by direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands. To achieve the same results in the world of perfumes, this former IFF chose to target young consumers in South Asia, China and India where, with a penetration rate of less than 1%, niche perfumery has significant growth potential. She relied on influencers and above all on a brand concept that was innovative, consistent and reassuring. ""We have strived to reinvent the entire customer experience, both online and in retail. We offer many possibilities for customising perfumes, but also bottles while offering high quality, transparent and sustainable French perfumery,"" explains the founder. Maison 21G offers a range of 35 combinable fragrances, developed with IFF’s perfumers. It is thus possible to create one’s made-to-measure perfumes on-demand using ad hoc technology. If they wish so, consumers can be guided in their creation by a quiz - online or in-store - based on their personality, favourite fragrances and ingredients. And of course, the 30 ml bottles can also be personalised with a message and an image. A double roller bottle concept has even been developed to allow customers to adapt their perfume to the different moments of the day. Along the same line, the brand has wanted to unleash the creativity of customers with its range of home fragrances! Maison 21G has designed Dual Candles that allow two different scents to be easily combined to create a personalised home ambience. A set of mini candles also made to be combined at will, allows creating the unique olfactory signature of one’s home. Finally, the Luciole Olfactive oil burner allows the twelve scented oils of the Maison 21G collection to be combined to create the desired ambience, for indoor or outdoor use. Most of the fragrances are mixed fragrances, and all are 100% vegan, free of preservatives, GMOs, CMR substances and phthalates. The bottles are refillable and the brand aims for zero plastic waste. To make its young customers feel at ease, the brand has freed itself from the lingo of perfumery experts. Maison 21G does not refer to chypre or citrus fragrances but to ingredients: bergamot, jasmine, rose, citrus fruits... ""New World wines have succeeded in making their mark worldwide with a simple approach based on grape varieties. In the same way, I believe that the narrative on perfumes should be made accessible to as many people as possible,"" stresses Johanna Monange. The choice of small sizes (30ml), which are more affordable (less than 100 dollars) than large sizes, follows the same logic. The small formats also help to maintain the interest of Millennials and Gen Z, the core target of Maison 21G, who are fond of new products but not very loyal, and who can thus more easily build up a varied ""olfactory wardrobe"". Again to bring the brand closer to its consumers, Johanna Monange very quickly relied on influencers and invested in social media. ""We invited KOLs to create their own perfumes, to try our discovery kits, to educate themselves about perfume,"" she explains. The IRL experience has not been forgotten, with in-store workshops, on reservation, and an omnichannel shopping experience allowing, among other things, to easily find in-store the olfactory profiles and fragrances created online. After two successful fundraisings, the brand looks to the future with optimism. ""Today, there is a real interest in perfume among the younger generations in Asia, including China,"" concludes Johanna Monange. ""We don’t just offer customisable perfumes, but perfumes that can be adapted to different times of the day, to different seasons, just like clothes."""
Upcycling and transparency: J.U.S Parfums successfully plays with trends,"Originally, J.U.S was only a bet: Thierry de Baschmakoff, Artistic Director and designer, wanted to illustrate all the current trends that were not found in perfume at a trade show dedicated to alternative brands: upcycling, open-source (i.e., the release of the formula), DIY. For instance, for this project, the bottles are recycled, their decoration consists of a self-made balloon envelope, the composition of the juice devised by Céline Ellena is communicated and displayed, the furniture is second-hand... At the venue, the concept is a hit among visitors and professionals alike. ""The perception was very positive, which we did not expect. The visitors’ reaction to the fact that the perfumer’s formula was released made us realise that this was a real enhancement of the perfumer’s profession,"" details Thierry de Baschmakoff. With the support of Brigitte Worsmer and Jean Baptiste Roux, Thierry de Baschmakoff decided to transform the idea into a real brand with the priority of keeping the concept’s original ingredients. J.U.S, for Joyau Unique et Sensoriel, was launched in 2018. The upcycling aspect lies in the reuse of old moulds from the glassmaker Waltersperger to make the bottles. ""There is a mix of genres. We also used water-based lacquering to protect the juices from the light and give them a slight pop effect,"" adds the designer. These screw-neck bottles can be refilled whatever their size via aluminium refills or at the perfume bar installed at Le Printemps Paris. Upcycling also concerns merchandising. The material used at the point of sale comes exclusively from recycled materials, right down to the pencil jars from the 1970s. The juices of the 12 fragrances were created by some of today’s most talented perfumers in the French perfume industry, in collaboration with Brigitte Worsmer, who was in charge of the olfactory creative coordination. Céline Ellena, Aliénor Massenet, Alexandra Carlin and Aurélien Guichard were given carte blanche, with the commitment to communicate their formulas in complete transparency. ""The idea of open source was not easy at first, but perfumers finally accepted it, realising that transparency is a fundamental trend. It also allows the perfumer’s work to be promoted and the ingredients to be highlighted. It leads to a more open and sophisticated language,"" assures Thierry de Baschmakoff. Under the impetus and management of Jean-Baptiste Roux, the brand is gaining a foothold. In addition to its online sales platform, it is available in seven (and soon ten) perfume stores in France, as well as in the various Printemps stores. Internationally, it is present in various outlets in Russia and the Middle East. A recent round of financing has also enabled the company to accelerate its development in Europe, where it will soon enter stores in Spain, Switzerland and Poland, as well as in China and Korea, where new store openings are planned. ""We are on a good development trend. We still have plenty of markets to open in Asia, such as Indonesia, or Japan, where consumers could appreciate this type of alternative brand,"" adds the manager. On the product side, two new formats of 25 and 50 ml are in the making. ""We are also working on new juices to go even further on the olfactory side. Next year, we plan to launch a new line of scented candles with an original approach in terms of design, still based on the upcycling of the item. Finally, we don’t rule out collaborating in a project on spirits one day,"" concludes Thierry de Baschmakoff."
"MakeMyMask, the combination of bespoke, natural and home-made cosmetics","A pharmacist by training, Julie Pernet initially formulated for herself, masks based on Ayurvedic powders to deal with hair loss issues she was experiencing following a pregnancy. ""Although Ayurvedic powders are already proposed by DIY cosmetic specialists, their use is still reserved for experienced users because there are a lot of different solutions available. I wanted to democratize and simplify the use of these powders and lift the two main barriers, which are the choice of powders according to one’s skin condition and the way to blend them together in the best possible way,"" explains the creator. During two years, she developed an algorithm referencing all these powders, as well as the vegetable and essential oils that she considered essential. She then defined six scalp care objectives (detox, strength, lightness, growth, cleansing and beauty), to which 60 different types of powders were suited. ""To have strong and beautiful hair, you have to work at the root level to deliver all the nutrients. The scalp needs balanced nutrients to produce sebum, keratin and all the hair fibres,"" she says. Each mask has four essential ingredients, explains the designer: a fortifying and detoxifying ayurvedic powder selected to address the main issue; a nourishing plant oil selected to match the hair type; a treating essential oil based on the type of scalp (oily, normal or sensitive) and an aloe vera powder to moisturise and regenerate. The bespoke typology is determined from an online diagnosis that will allow selecting the right ingredients. ""You don’t necessarily have to have a specific issue to deal with, it can simply be to make your hair look more beautiful and shiny, in which case you will opt for the beauty cure,"" explains Julie Pernet. For each concern, there is a cure box that includes: 4 sachets of powders to make 4 masks to apply once a week; the essential oil; the vegetable oil; the application brush and the jar to make the mixture in. Each element can then be ordered separately. ""I’ve pre-measured each element which means that the user only has to mix the three ingredients, add water and have her mask fresh and ready to apply, in 30 seconds,"" she adds. The ingredients are natural and organic, and the packaging is designed with an eco-responsible glass and cardboard profile. The closure system of the powder bags is made of oxo-degradable plastic. The cure box with 4 masks is available at the price of 45 euros. The ritual also includes a shampoo and a detangling balm, both natural, to be used after applying the mask, (35 euros each). Launched last February, MakeMyMask already claims a 50% repeat purchase rate. The founder plans to develop new hair care products to democratise the DIY approach to cosmetics. “There is a strong demand for vegetable dyes. I would like to find a partner specialised in this field to develop a complementary quality offer,"" she adds."
"MS Beautilab acquires Gi Picco’s, a European specialist for cosmetic powders","Olivier Salaun nailed his colours to the mast shortly after his appointment as head of Marvinpac: MS Beautilab - the Beauty Division of the Swiss group - would benefit from significant investments in order to strengthen its product portfolio, its innovation capabilities and its geographic reach. Dubbed “Pulse 2025”, the company’s strategy aims to strengthen its skincare and make-up as well as its international development. MS Beautilab has just taken a first step with the acquisition of GI Piccos Cosmetics, an Italian makeup manufacturer specializing in coloured powders. “Gi Picco’s technology is next-generation in powder manufacturing. They offer incredibly creative and attractive solutions that are influenced by the world of design, art and Italian fashion. It has been in GI Picco’s DNA since 1967,” explains Olivier Salaun. ""They are also very much anchored in a sustainable and economic reality to respond to brands globally."" According to Irene Inguaggiato, General Manager of Gi Picco’s, the Italian company has a perfect mastery of cutting edge technologies such as Top Injection, which makes it possible to formulate powders from a mix of solid and liquids. “This allows for a more creamy, luxurious and luminous formula, which is higher in iridescence than pressed powders”, she says. Enrico Colombo, Director of Operations, specifies: “Unlike Back-Injection, Top Injection lets several shades to be poured without a separator, allowing for varied compositions, three-dimentional decorations and the customization of a palette. Patterns that are raised or embossed, pearlescence, glitter effects, - anything is possible!” This is a beautiful illustration of Gi Picco’s motto: L’idea diventa colore (“The idea becomes colour”). Following this merger MS BeautiLab now operates three make-up and skincare R&D laboratories (located in France, Italy and Switzerland), and four production sites including a full service facility in Czech Republic. Other international developments are expected, especially in North America. To be continued !"

"“Omnichannel is a priority for luxury beauty retail,” Wolfgang Baier, LUXASIA ","To reach their ambitious double digit annual growth targets, LUXASIA has been investing heavily into technology and teams, collaborating closely with retail partners, to become the omnichannel leader on the Asia-Pacific luxury beauty stage. And this proved to be a key asset when the new coronavirus began to spread around the world. “We have been enhancing our online retail for several years, and when COVID-19 hit we were more than ready, with more than 250 e-commerce stores already serving customers in the whole region,” says Wolfgang Baier, Group CEO of LUXASIA. “In 2020, driven by the pandemic, our total online sales skyrocketed by more than three times, with one of our business units even achieving 60% online share of total sales for the year.” With more than 120 luxury brands in their portfolio, 8000 points-of-sale, 2000 talents employed, and numerous joint ventures with major luxury players such as LVMH, Shiseido, Yves Rocher and Puig, LUXASIA serves 15 markets representing more than 3 billion potential consumers, who are now eager to return to normal. “We might be biased, but Asia-Pacific is the place to be for beauty and retail now,” emphasizes Baier. LUXASIA understood way earlier on that omnichannel was a priority for businesses looking to gain an edge in the new retail landscape. The company began its omnichannel journey five years ago. Baier decided to enhance the group’s ecommerce and digital capabilities and to implement a consumer analytics-led approach to both its brick-and-mortar and online strategies. To help brands successfully achieve their online aspirations and provide them with relevant tools, LUXASIA has launched LEAP Commerce, a regional full-service e-commerce enabler covering all digital channels: online marketplaces, mono- & multi-brand sites, and social commerce. The platform is forecast to generate 2 million transactions this year, and LUXASIA’s aim is to grow sales up to ten times in the next five years. Its next frontier would also be to accelerate and dominate luxury beauty social commerce. The Asia Pacific distributor has consumer-centricity at its core, with a database that includes more than 1.5 million luxury consumers, with validated preferences, growing at a rate of 30,000 to 40,000 consumers monthly. LUXASIA wants to know not only what people bought, but what they are looking for and their preferences. “Data is crucial for customer engagement,” highlights Baier. All LUXASIA’s retail staff are equipped with tablets linked to its CRM engine, providing visibility of customer preferences and past purchases. This empowers the retail workforce with information to make recommendations that resonate, enabling effective up-selling and cross-selling. “We invested massively over the last years to train and develop our 2000 LUXASIANs, especially on customer relationship management and digital marketing,” explains the CEO. Beyond in-store engagements, LUXASIA also uses its CRM engine, Salesforce, and the accompanying AI solution to drive consistent yet impactful consumer marketing. In parallel, it has been critical albeit challenging to adapt its supply chain and operations to this business model shift. As LUXASIA manages most of its warehouses, it was possible to transform them over the past years. “Our fulfilment centers are now ecommerce-ready, optimised for both B2B and B2C operations,” says Baier. The company continues to invest into its technology infrastructure, including the warehouse management system, order management system, as well as a middleware that smoothens ecommerce operations across numerous online marketplaces in multiple languages and geographies. While 30%-50% of all luxury sales in the Asia-Pacific region are expected to come from online in the near future, with social commerce being the next big wave, Wolfgang Baier says players need to streamline and enhance their omni-retail networks. As far as brick-and-mortar stores are concerned, this means they have to be fully integrated to the whole omnichannel system while providing a high-value additional experience. According to Baier, niche brands have a huge potential in providing such high-end experiences, both online and in-store. LUXASIA has been shaping receptivity and growth of niche beauty in Singapore for more than 15 years through its Escentials omni-retail concept, combining an boutique website and three brick-and-mortar stores. Escentials carry leading niche luxury brands such as Creed, Acqua di Parma, Frédéric Malle, Diptyque, Maison Francis Kurkdjian, Penhaligon’s, Byredo and so on. “Asian consumers are becoming much more concerned with what they are buying, the story behind it and how they differentiate themselves with it,” states Baier. To capture the galloping niche beauty interest and demand across the region, LUXASIA will be launching Escentials in Malaysia with the opening of a new site in October 2021 and a retail store in Kuala Lumpur in November 2021, followed by an expansion into Thailand and Vietnam in 2022. Truly exciting times for luxury and niche beauty in Asia Pacific."
ADA bets on a sustainable approach combined with an expansion towards Asia,"As a hotel industry supplier, ADA Cosmetics International has faced the full impact of the coronavirus pandemic. This situation was anything but a perfect start for CEO Kai Bendix, who assumed management responsibility for the tradition-rich company shortly after the first lockdown in July 2020. But the challenges were already enormous prior to that, with a strong competitive pressure, and the rise of environmental awareness and social responsibility issues. To meet these challenges, the German hotel cosmetics manufacturer plans to sharpen its brand positioning, invest massively in the development of sustainable product innovations, and in CSR commitments. According to the company, this paradigm shift calls for the development of new solutions that put sustainability at the heart of product development. “This means that instead of doing whatever is technically feasible, we develop product solutions that contribute to the bigger picture,” says Kai Bendix. The company’s R&D department is already working intensively on innovations with a focus on the careful use of resources, the avoidance of waste, and efficient recycling. A return system for empty cartridges and a method for aseptic filling of open dispenser systems are also in the works. At the beginning of next year, ADA plans to launch a new, completely sustainable cosmetics range that will include everything from shower gel to nail files. Work is continuing on packaging that will significantly increase the use of recycled and renewable materials. To boost its growth, the company is planning to expand in Asia’s growth markets, primarily in China. A new structure was established in the country to coordinate sales activities – from supply chain to marketing – across national boundaries. Another aspect of the new ADA Cosmetics strategy is to build up the company’s innovative strength. With this in mind, the management team is on the lookout worldwide for exciting, young skin-care brands as potential partners. This offers a lot of potential for both sides. Furthermore, company plans to enter the consumer business and build a second foothold. ""In the coming years, the ’New ADA’ will help make us stronger, more innovative, and more sustainable than ever before,"" concludes Bendix."
"Online sampling, a major factor in product discovery, according to Odore","Now a specialist in online sampling campaigns, Odore first made a name for itself by placing connected sample dispensers in strategic urban locations. The start-up works with beauty brands and groups such as L’Oréal, Sephora, Guerlain, Clive Christian and LVMH to improve the performance of online campaigns through a data-driven marketing approach. As sales become increasingly digital, more and more beauty brands are using digital marketing in conjunction with sampling to track the previously hard-to-measure conversion of consumers using targeted campaigns. Thanks to the Odore platform, brands can create and launch digital campaigns on social media, by email and on their site, alongside physical sampling. With its platform, Odore was able to analyse the purchasing habits of 20,000 consumers of beauty and cosmetic products over 12 months and thus deliver various telling data on the behaviour of consumers when faced with the sample. According to the study, 85% of those who tested a product did not know the brand beforehand. Once they had tested the product, 75% of the respondents said they had bought or were likely to buy the product. Beyond the well-known role of sampling in the discovery of new products, Odore also highlights the relevance of sending samples to people’s homes. Indeed, despite their interest in the tested products, only 33% of respondents said they would have gone to a shop to try the product. Receiving the sample at home is clearly a conversion booster, even more so when coupled with an online purchase offer. ""The spikes in conversion rates and brand awareness clearly show the role that digital sampling can play in helping confidential brands make a name for themselves,"" explains Armaan Mehta, co-founder of Odore."

TechnicoFlor celebrates 40th anniversary and inaugurates new automated factory,"TechnicoFlor’s 5,000 sqm new production facility will allow the family business to double its production capacity, bringing it to 2,000 tonnes of perfumes per year. Moreover, thanks to the automation of the entire process, TechnicoFlor plans to halve the duration of its operations and thus be able to supply its customers in less than 5 days. The cornerstone  of this new facility is a modular robot of more than 40 meters long with very short production cycles that can weight more than 500 liquid raw materials and produce several sizes of orders at the same time (from 5 to 1000 litres ). In addition, a module dedicated to powders can process 20 different raw materials with weights ranging from 30 mg to 1000 kg. To avoid pumps, the products are entirely filled using gravity. A state-of-the-art R&D laboratory completes the brand new construction. Of course, the site has been designed to reduce the environmental impact of production activities. ""With the new site and the help of all of our perfumers and employees, we are able to create innovative formulas that respect nature, and supply our customers with very short delays"", explains François-Patrick Sabater, Founder and Chairman of TechnicoFlor. The company, which currently generates 55 million euros in turnover, intends to use these new production tools to boost its growth and reach its target of 100 million euros within three years. Already selling in more than 60 countries - in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Western Europe and Central Europe - TechnicoFlor plans to open a new creative centre in Moscow and to build a new production site in Shanghai, in the so-called Beautéville, China’s new “Cosmetic Valley”. The company, which specializes in natural and responsible compositions, is also strengthening its environmental commitments by participating in the creation of a new fair trade supply-chain in Burkina Faso. After launching a responsible purchasing program in 2020, as well as a perfume biodegradability calculator, TechnicoFlor now wants to launch an ""Eco-Score"" in order to offer more transparency to consumers."
"Clever Beauty, green and anti-waste nail polishes","Tired of seeing her mother transfer the remains of her nail polishes from one bottle to the other to avoid wastage, Maëva Bentitallah, a young committed entrepreneur and founder of Clever Beauty, wanted to bring a concrete solution to a waste problem related to the length of the brush in the bottle. ""According to the tests carried out, between 15 and 48% of the product can be lost, depending on the brand. I pushed the doors of a Fablab, which proposed 3D software, to create an anti-waste cap system that would allow recovering the remaining 20% that can be lost on average in nail polish bottles. We had to find a configuration where the brush becomes longer when the bottle is opened, hence this push-button system. When you open the bottle, you press the button and the brush goes down. Once closed, the system is locked,"" she explains. In collaboration with the specialised French supplier Fiabila, Clever Beauty nail polishes also offer a cleaner alternative formula, free of 10 controversial ingredients and made from bio-sourced solvents derived from cotton, corn and cassava. The formula is considered safe for little girls from 3 years old, pregnant and breastfeeding women. ""We also sell to beauty salons, which use a lot of polish daily, and can experience tolerance problems. Professionals breathe in more than 3,000 molecules every day, so there’s a real issue here,"" emphasises the founder. These green nail polishes claim to be equivalent to their conventional counterparts in terms of staying power (4 to 6 days with a good application), shine and coverage. The range of 14 references is available in 11 colours, deemed essential and chosen by the brand’s community to advocate responsible consumption, and three care, base and fruit vitamin-enriched polishes. The bottles are recyclable after use. ""At the request of our customers, we have also launched a natural nail polish remover, the first returnable nail polish remover with a pump to apply the right amount of product,"" adds Maëva Bentitallah. The products are made in France by promoting short circuits and are filled and assembled by workers with disabilities in Marseille. The founder’s idea is to develop a complete and consistent make-up range, based on the brand’s DNA, which seeks to combine natural formulas without compromising on quality, and clever packaging. She recently finalised a crowdfunding campaign for her new #Invincible Mascara and launched pre-orders on her website. ""This will be the first mascara in a refillable glass bottle with organic actives and made in France. The user keeps the brush and only buys the glass mascara refill. We worked 8 months on the formula to propose French sourced actives and to remain intransigent in terms of quality and wear,"" she specifies. Clever Beautyproducts are sold online as well as on Nocibé.fr and through 200 partners in France and 9 countries, including Switzerland, Luxembourg, the United States, Iceland, and in Douglas perfumeries in Italy."
Granado’s global targets change the game on the Brazilian market,"With Bossa, which was launched in Brazil for Christmas 2020, and then in France in March 2021, Granado aimed to celebrate its 150th anniversary with a fragrance just as iconic as Carioca: five years earlier, the latter had symbolized the peak of the brand’s effort to rebuild itself around its historic cradle, the centre of Rio de Janeiro. “If Carioca evokes Rio’s botanic garden, in the city itself, Bossa tells the story of a walk on the long beaches of Ipanema and Copacabana,” explains its creator Cécile Zarokian. And yet, both floral and solar, Bossa does not have the heavy notes often associated with tropical beaches. The vivid top notes (lemon, tangerine, petitgrain) balance the sweeter, more floral middle scents (frangipani, musk). “I didn’t want a substitute with heavy monoï and coconut notes, I was too scared to fall into the usual clichés of the French girl discovering Brazil,” emphasizes Cécile Zarokian. To seize the city smell, she had frequent, long walks in the Urca neighbourhood, right at the feet of the Sugarloaf Mountain, where the ocean smell is carried by a soft, fresh breeze. Created in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, Bossa is also meant to be joyful, positive, full of glee – an echo to the Cariocas and their legendary joie de vivre. “The project went real fast: I left my first meeting with the Granado team with briefs. Then, the brand liked my creation’s originality a lot: they thought it was both innovative on the Brazilian market and accessible to most,” recalls Cécile Zarokian. Indeed, just like its predecessor Carioca, Bossa was supposed to solve a complex equation: representing Rio as the perfect gift for tourists coming to Brazil, without being grotesque, so it could also seduce Brazilian customers, this historic brand being so dear to them. When interviewed by Alessandra Tucci, the founder of Paralela Escola Olfativa, partner of Cinquième Sens in Brazil, Granado’s Marketing Director Sissi Freeman explained Cécile Zarokian’s choice by the importance the brand attaches to innovation: “For this project, we had invited Cécile as well as other perfumers from composition companies. And she got it immediately. She managed to convey what we wanted perfectly well: the sea’s lightness – Rio’s lightness. We had wanted a sophisticated coconut note in our collection for so long.” “It has been a few years since Granado started making considerable efforts to reconnect with its roots and upgrade its offering. They aim to set the standard of a Brazilian perfumery that finds an echo all around the world,” explains Cécile Zarokian. Supported by Puig, which took a stake in the Brazilian group in 2016 and owns the Phebo brand, the true symbol of the country’s art of perfume, Granado takes its time to let juices macerate – if it is a key practice in traditional French perfumery, it is little used in Brazil. To meet ever-more demanding local customers’ expectations, extreme care is taken of the bottles, caps, and cases. The case graphics, hardly retouched by Granado’s designers, were directly taken from the brand’s archives. How can this not strengthen the love story between Brazil and perfumes? The country is the second largest market in the world in volume, neck and neck with the USA, and the third or fourth largest in value, depending on the current exchange rates. Now, if economic difficulties weigh heavily on their expenses, Brazilians are very knowledgeable about global fragrances, now widely distributed in all big cities. Even niche perfumes are getting popular! If most global brands on this segment are still unaffordable to a large majority of consumers, local players offer their own interpretation of the concept, as can be seen with the Boticário group: last April, they launched O.U.I, a high-end perfume line designed in France and produced in Brazil. In addition, the investments in quality made by Brazilian brands are paying off: in 2020, in the middle of the Covid crisis, perfume sales in the country rose by 8.4%, according to the Brazilian association of the personal hygiene, cosmetics and perfumes industry (ABIHPEC). “Brazilians are increasingly surprised by national perfume brands’ offerings. In addition to make very high quality products, they have kept investing in innovation over the past few years,” says João Carlos Basilio, President of ABIHPEC. With Bossa, Granado was the first major Brazilian brand to decide to work with an independent French perfumer. Still, the fragrance, which can be found in multiple other products, from soap to shower gels or candles, was entirely produced in Brazil. “To make the juice, I worked with my local partner, Vollmens. In the middle of the sanitary crisis, they managed to import raw materials unavailable in Brazil, like lemon from Argentina, tangerine from Italy, and a few synthetic molecules I specifically requested,” recalls Cécile Zarokian. If the launch in France, meant to be boosted with a pop-up store at Galeries Lafayette Champs-Élysées, did not go as expected due to the third lockdown during which physical points of sale closed between April 3 and May 3, 2021, Bossa’s sales now seem to be in line with the brand’s expectations. According to Alessandra Tucci, perfume, strategy and innovation expert and founder of training company Paralela Escola Olfativa, in São Paulo, Brazil, it is actually “the floral, solar fragrance that was missing on the Brazilian market”."
"La Beauté Française, the BtoB marketplace for Made-in-France indie brands","For Marie-Laure Durier, the Founder and Director of this new player in the French market, the explosion of new eco-responsible cosmetic brands, which coincides with new consumer expectations and purchasing habits, implies a transformation of distribution methods. ""We need to accelerate the off-line and on-line consumer experience,"" she explains. After 25 years in the luxury sector, this former Clarins and Guerlain executive noticed the absence of young French green beauty brands on the shelves of retailers, at a time when consumers are on the lookout for committed French brands. This sparked the idea of a platform capable of facilitating and accelerating the setting up of contacts between young brands and retailers. ""Young brands often find it difficult to find outlets or retailers because when they start up, they often only have about ten references whereas a large group will often offer more than 300; it’s not the same return on investment for a buyer,"" underlines the entrepreneur. Marie-Laure Durier believes that independent brands have a key role to play in revitalising the French cosmetics market, one of the most challenging in the world, with a highly concentrated distribution system and consumers used to a very high level of quality. According to her, among the many local and independent brands that are created each year, there are many promising companies capable of shifting lines, especially with more responsible products. ""We exclusively chose French brands, with a clean formula and aiming for zero waste. We are looking for disruptive and committed products, such as chewable toothpaste, waterless formulas, bamboo fibre linen, natural perfumes,..."". To facilitate the interaction between these start-ups and the various distributors in the sector, La Beauté Française does not require any subscription, nor any fixed costs, and only pays itself via a commission on the sales made. Access to the platform, therefore, does not involve any drain on the brands’ cash flow as long as no sales have been made. The platform also makes it easier to grasp the complexity of retailing and to access its variety in a much easier way. ""Distribution channels on the platform are varied, such as in-home players, beauty salons, hairdressers/barbershops, hotel spas, drugstores and pharmacies, perfumeries, perfumery groups and chains, department stores and travel retail,"" details Marie-Laure Durier. For her project, the founder wanted a technological solution capable of managing the complexity of the sector, adapted to the needs of professionals while offering an attractive and functional interface. ""In addition to cosmetic products, we also have products for professionals such as linen, aesthetic outfits, or gift packs,"" she explains. We chose to manage the variety of products through a system of tabs allowing for easy navigation between the different categories offered. To launch the first BtoB marketplace dedicated to French beauty, Marie-Laure Durier chose to work with the publisher Wizaplace. ""La Beauté Française was launched in a few months using our all-in-one marketplace solution. As with any BtoB platform, payment was a key issue. Adapting payment terms and allowing 30-day direct debit was a prerequisite for La Beauté Française to meet the expectations of both professional buyers and sellers,"" explains Eric Alessandri, CEO of Wizaplace. To access the platform, the various stakeholders must identify themselves and show that they belong to the beauty or well-being sector via an online registration form. Once their registration has been validated, retailers have access to professional prices for the different products on offer and only need to place an order!"
IBG: “Tailor-made turnkey solutions for retailers and beauty brands”,"Premium Beauty News - Innovative Beauty Group is now one year old. Could you introduce this new entity for us? Xavier Leclerc de Hauteclocque - IBG’s three brands cover three customer segments and three regions. Since the purchases we made in 2019, we have headed three global brands: Orchard Custom Beauty devises turnkey solutions and accounts for 70% of our business, Fasten Packaging produces tailor-made packaging and represents 25% of our business, and Travel Designer offers airlines comfort kits in partnership with cosmetic brands – of course, their results reflect the consequences of the current pandemic on travelling. Our three customer segments are supermarket distributors and discount retailers, distributors specialized in beauty, airlines, and of course, cosmetic brands – Albéa’s historic business. Lastly, as regards the three regions, we support customers in America, Europe, and increasingly often in Asia, thanks to our global network of responsible suppliers. Premium Beauty News - Albéa has diversified the group’s historic business, then. What was your approach? Xavier Leclerc de Hauteclocque - The success of the IBG concept is based on four pillars, the first being agility. It is really our spearhead, because we promise an optimum development time, in particular by integrating design as early as the global product design phase. The second pillar is our ability to imagine comprehensive ranges of 20, 30 or 50 products. They can be turnkey solutions combining packs, formulas, and accessories, or only packaging made of plastic, wood, metal, or glass. The third is the tailor-made approach: we work in close collaboration with our customers, as an extension of their own teams. Ultimately, of course, we take advantage of Albéa’s expertise in CSR. Although IBG is not an industrial manufacturer, the whole management team shares this historic sustainability commitment with me. Premium Beauty News - How did you come up with the idea of creating this service entity within the Albéa group? Xavier Leclerc de Hauteclocque - We wanted to serve complementary customers in a complementary manner. IBG has set up a very broad, most agile ecosystem for design and project management, which helps develop concepts from A to Z as well as comprehensive ranges on various market segments for both prestige and mass customers. Right from the start, our approach is customer-oriented: what matters is their positioning and wishes! Together, we imagine the best solution, find the best partners, and manage the project. Design and sustainable development – which plays an increasingly significant part – are definitely at the core of the project. In 2020, 86% of our customer proposals were eco-designed. We will reach 95% in 2021 with packs, formulas, and also accessories! Premium Beauty News - What is your positioning on the market? Xavier Leclerc de Hauteclocque - We adapt to our customers’ organization and to the project value chain. We have global teams, so we can stick to that pretty easily. We cover graphic design, design-to-cost, and product development with or without the formula. Plus, we manage our projects in an agility-oriented manner, by taking care of quality and regulatory management, logistics, and even digital matters, like product animation and social media! Premium Beauty News - What are your customers’ main problems? Xavier Leclerc de Hauteclocque - Digitalization changed the game. Today, beyond the traditional product segmentation, our concepts need to take into account our customers’ communities’ expectations. As a matter of fact, expectations can vary from one country or distribution channel to another. This creates logistic and regulatory constraints, and it also requires great cultural awareness. Premium Beauty News - What are your objectives, development-wise? Xavier Leclerc de Hauteclocque - We aim to both keep developing our model on the American and European markets and widen our presence in Asia. I would also like to strengthen our collaboration with customers as regards CSR, a strategic, high-priority, transversal issue. There is still a gap between the “green” solutions we offer or can offer and our customers’ choices. Lastly, digital technologies remain our second main development focus, in particular regarding customer experience in the long term. Actually, I believe that by getting consumers involved with brands’ product strategies, responsible choices will prevail! Premium Beauty News - What conclusions do you draw from IBG’s first year, given this oh-so particular context? Xavier Leclerc de Hauteclocque - We have all been affected by the pandemic, and many of us still are, from a personal, social, and economic standpoint. Within this context, we have taken advantage of the fact that most of our retailer customers were still able to welcome their clients during the various lockdown periods, which partly offset the collapse of air traffic and the difficulties encountered by other sales channels. That is what helped us get satisfactory results, and it was much encouraging given the fact it is such a young business. It also shows how increasingly important agility and flexibility are for brands. That is why I would like to seize this opportunity to warmly thank all my teams for being able to adapt this new, highly volatile environment."
"Geka celebrates opening of HQ’s expansion in Bechhofen, Germany","The new facility combines Geka’s almost 100 years’ experience in development of high-precision beauty application solutions with innovative production systems designed to strengthen their manufacturing and decoration capabilities. “The in-house developed assembly line combined with the knowledge and agility of Geka’s staff will allow to support the customer’s requirements even better,” said the company. The new silk screen printing technology and the upgraded hot foil printing capability will give Geka an edge on the decoration abilities and capacity by raising the number of cylindrical or conical packaging decorated annually.

"Trade shows are back, but caution prevails everywhere","While several trade shows, such as China Beauty Expo or Luxe Pack Shanghai and MakeUp in Shanghai, have been held in mainland China since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, North America and Europe are hardly starting to reopen the doors to their main events. In the United States, Cosmoprof North America is leading the way on August 29-31 in Las Vegas, Nevada. In accordance with government guidelines and local mandates, the organisers are following recommendations for capacity limits, physical distancing, increased sanitization and other safety protocols. In Europe, Édition Spéciale by Luxe Pack, in Paris, on August 31 and September 1, followed by MCB by Beauté Sélection, at Paris Expo on September 4 to 6, and OnBeauty by Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna, from September 9 to 13, 2021, in Bologna, Italy, will be the first events dedicated to the beauty to be held. TFWA World Exhibition & Conference, October 24-28 in Cannes, as well as Luxe Pack Monaco, on September 27-29 and Cosmetic 360, on October 13-14, will follow. For these events too, specific sanitary measures will be implemented, in particular the obligation to wear a mask and to be in possession of a valid COVID 19 green certification. Beauty World Middle-East will run from 5-7 October at Dubai World Trade Centre, promising to be the first major in-person international beauty event of 2021. The show will host 15 country pavilions, including a French pavilion with 71 companies. However, with many restrictions on international travel remaining in effect, several events have been postponed, such as in-cosmetics Global, which will finally be held from April 5 to 7, 2022 in Paris, and in-cosmetics Asia, which will take place from November 1 to 3, 2022 in Bangkok, or Cosmoprof Asia, which is postponed until November 16-18, 2022. It remains to check whether visitors - including local ones - will come massively since several big players have not lifted travel restrictions yet. In any case, the desire to meet again is here to stay! Main trade shows for the beauty industry from September to December 2021:

Maison Lesquendieu revives their heritage of exceptional fragrances,"Founded in 1903, Maison Lesquendieu owes its international success in the early 1900s to the unfailing demanding nature of pharmacist and perfumer Joseph Lesquendieu, who was only content with exceptional compositions based on first-choice raw materials. “My grandfather was anxious to stick to a small production. To him, no one could produce a lot without failing somewhere. There was a limit not to be exceeded to keep control of quality, from sourcing to the finished product. At that time, the brand developed in over 20 countries in ten years,” explains Jérôme Lesquendieu. This product-oriented hyper luxury spirit made the brand highly successful up until its heyday, in the 1960s. Today, it is coming back thanks to Jérôme Lesquendieu’s determination to offer the perfume world extreme refinement again, down to the smallest detail. “I had this feeling there was no such brand reminding of the 1920s in the perfume world, unlike in the luxury aviation or car industries: there was no segment where people ‘made the effort of excellence for something unnecessary’”, he says. To reach his target, the new Director was anxious to keep his grandfather’s original method: he refused any tolerance to imperfections and preserved manual work to make small volumes. By immersing himself in the perfumer’s archives, he revived five of the creations that best evoked Lesquendieu’s journey throughout the 20th century. Of course, the first “Historic” perfume is the very first fragrance created in 1903, Lesquendieu Le Parfum. “My grandfather was the son of a tanner, so there are leather notes, but also bergamot and jasmine notes. It is a particularly mysterious and sensual creation,” explains Jérôme Lesquendieu. Then, there are Feu de Bengale, created in 1925 and based on Madagascar vanilla, and Bonne Fortune, a 1927 fresh citrus-based perfume ending with warm notes: “it is the fragrance he wore the most,” adds the Director. These are followed by Glorilis, a powerful spicy oriental perfume which dates back to 1953, and lastly, Lilice. “My grandfather created this fragrance for my grandmother he called Lilice – only for his own personal use. I made this choice for the story it tells. It is a mixture of iris and rose, two fascinating materials complex to work with and balance.” Almost fully composed of natural materials, the juices boast a concentration of over 20% and last all day, as the original fragrances did. The bottles have the same bell shape as in the 1920s and display a few codes of that period. They are now decorated with a handmade pure 24-carat gold cap. Under Artistic Director Jérôme Lesquendieu, a new collection of five Oriental fragrances was recently launched in Dubai before being distributed in Europe in September. “It is a completely different range which I directed based on my grandfather’s travels to the Middle East,” he explains. Maison Lesquendieu counts over 50 points of sale in Europe – Jovoy in France, the Four Seasons in Geneva, Switzerland – and in the Middle East. It keeps expanding on the global level, in particular in Asia, Russia, the UK, and Eastern countries. The fragrances are available for about 240 euros for the Historic range and 280 euros for the Oriental Collection."
Shiseido sells several prestige makeup brands to refocus on high-end skincare,"The operation marks a global strategic shift for Japan’s largest cosmetics group, which is refocusing on higher-margin skin care products, particularly in Asia, with the aim to become a global leader in skin beauty by 2030. Earlier this year, Shiseido agreed to sell its mass market skin-care and toiletries business to CVC Capital Partners in a deal worth 160 billion yen (USD 1.5 billion or EUR 1.3 billion). Shiseido acquired Bare Escentuals-owned brands, bareMinerals and BUXOM in 2010, in a USD 1.9 billion deal. Laura Mercier was acquired in 2016 for or USD 248 million. According to the Japanese group, the combined sales of the three brands in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020, accounted for 4.9% of its consolidated net sales. The company said it will reinvest the funds obtained from the transfer into areas crucial for its long-term growth, “such as development of key brands and acquisitions, mainly in the skin beauty category, digital transformation, and enhancement of production capabilities and innovations."" However, Shiseido will not be pulling out of the US, where it continues to market brands such makeup brands as Nars, Clé de Peau Beauté, the skincare line Drunk Elephant, and fragrance brands including Issey Miyake, Narciso Rodriguez, and Dolce&Gabbana. Launched in 1995, bareMinerals is a U.S. leader in mineral-based cosmetics and is considered the creator of “clean beauty”. BUXOM, created in 2007, is a color cosmetics brand focused on “going big, being bold, and feeling sexy.” It is ranked among the top five U.S. brands across various lip categories. Prestige makeup brand Laura Mercier was founded in 1996 and pioneered the natural, “flawless face” category. According to Tricia Glynn, a Managing Director at Advent, bareMinerals, BUXOM, and Laura Mercier are “clear leaders in prestige beauty and are widely recognized for their quality, authenticity, and innovation, with differentiated products and devoted customers.” Advent will host the three brands into its newly formed affiliate, AI Beauty Holdings Ltd. Upon completion of the transaction, Pascal Houdayer, former Chief Executive Officer of NAOS (Bioderma, Esthederm, Etat Pur), will serve as Chief Executive Officer of the standalone business. “We believe these brands have significant runway for growth, particularly as we see the large and growing color cosmetics market benefitting from secular tailwinds. I look forward to helping expand these brands across new products, channels, and regions, while enabling the new company to realize its full potential,” said Pascal Houdayer."
The celebrities building business empires thanks to the beauty industry,"Who would have imagined 10 years ago that Rihanna would one day join the world’s select club of billionaires at just 33 years old, not thanks to her music, but thanks to her shrewd business skills? The singer has built a veritable empire thanks to her cosmetics brand Fenty Beauty, launched in 2017, which she owns in equal parts with the LVMH group. The brand is based on a strong theme of inclusiveness with, for example, a single foundation available in dozens of shades. Now, Forbes reports that the brand was already bringing in more than US $550 million in annual revenue in 2018, just one year after its creation. Today, it’s reportedly worth nearly US $2.8 billion, and recent launches (skincare, fragrances) suggest that the brand has far from finished growing. She may be known for her acting skills, but Jessica Alba is also a businesswoman who got into cosmetics a decade ago. The Honest Company, which offers natural beauty and baby products, is undoubtedly less popular than some cosmetic brands (with ""only"" 1 million followers on Instagram, compared to 10.8 million for Fenty Beauty by Rihanna). It is nevertheless still highly successful. According to a recent ranking by Cosmetify, the company has a turnover of US $300.5 million (compared to an estimated US $570 million for Rihanna’s brand). Crowned the world’s youngest billionaire in 2019 by Forbes, before being stripped of the title by the American magazine for inflating her income, Kylie Jenner can also boast of becoming a cosmetics mogul in just a few years — and she’s only 24. The young woman — who capitalizes on her 255 million Instagram followers (25.1 million for her brand) — has got everything right with Kylie Cosmetics, which has scores of followers around the world, and an estimated revenue of nearly US $200 million, according to Cosmetify. The brand, which offers makeup and skincare, even outstrips KKW Beauty, the brand of her older sister Kim Kardashian, launched three years later. Note that for a few years now, celebrities have been launching their own beauty brands, whether in makeup or skin care. Lady Gaga, Millie Bobby Brown, Selena Gomez, Jennifer Lopez, Cindy Crawford and Miranda Kerr are just some of the celebrities who now have their own beauty brands."
The Hut Group takes over online beauty retailer Cult Beauty for £275 million,"Cult Beauty was co-founded in London in 2007 by Jessica DeLuca and Alexia Inge as an online specialist retailer of emerging, prestige beauty brands across skincare, haircare and cosmetics. Today, Cult Beauty stocks about 300 prestige beauty brands - including Charlotte Tilbury, Drunk Elephant and Huda Beauty - many of them (over 70%) being independent. According to The Hut Group, around two-thirds of these brands are not currently listed on the group’s other beauty sites. The UK e-commerce giant sees this as an important opportunity to complete its offering. “Cult Beauty is frequently the partner of choice for emerging indie brands due to its personalised, content-led approach and enthusiastic consumer base who are continually seeking new, innovative solutions to complement their beauty routines,” THG chief executive Matthew Moulding said. “Cult Beauty’s first-to-market reputation makes the brand an exciting fit for our THG Beauty division,"" he added. The Hut Group plans to keep Cult Beauty’s separate branding and identity intact. “Due to its distinguished brand portfolio, Cult Beauty will retain a very clear identity within THG Beauty,” highlighted the company in a statement. According to The Hut Group, this acquisition will also be an opportunity to develop Cult Beauty’s international reach. Indeed, currently less than 50% of Cult Beauty’s sales are made outside the UK. ""We anticipate fully migrating Cult Beauty onto the THG Ingenuity platform by the end of the year (within the first six months of acquisition), giving the brand access to the global digital features to underpin significant future growth,"" said Matthew Moulding. The acquisition will help The Hut Group to better address consumers’ preferences globally. ""THG Beauty will principally service customers within North America via our Dermstore and Lookfantastic brands, while in the UK, Europe, Asia and the Rest of the World the key brands will be Lookfantastic and Cult Beauty,"" detailed Matthew Moulding. The Hut Group expects Cult Beauty to contribute sales of about £60m and adjusted EBITDA of about £3m for the remainder of FY 2021, and contribute sales of approximately £140m and adjusted EBITDA of £10m in FY 2022. Most recently, Sephora announced the acquisition of Feelunique, another major online retailer of prestige beauty products in the UK."
Sephora acquires Feelunique and makes first foray into the UK market,"LVMH-owned beauty retail heavyweight Sephora has agreed to buy online cosmetics retailer Feelunique in a deal that marks its first big push into the UK. The acquisition, which is subject to clearance by anti-trust authorities, is expected to be closed during the 2nd semester of 2021, according to Sephora. The amount of the transaction has not been disclosed, however British media have mentioned a total amount of 132 million pounds sterling (about 154 million euros). “The transaction is a key step in Sephora’s European growth strategy and marks a first step for Sephora’s presence into the United Kingdom,” commented Martin Brok, President and CEO of Sephora in a release. According to Sephora, the United Kingdom is one of the top 10 biggest prestige beauty markets worldwide, with a very high level of digital adoption. “UK consumers have a strong appetite for a carefully curated Prestige Beauty offer that is tailored to their needs, and provided through a consumer-centric, seamless experience,” adds Martin Brok. However, Boots’ strong positions in this market has long been a big hurdle for the French group. Founded in 2005, Feelunique is a fast-growing business. To date, the e-commerce player claims 1.3 million active customers and stocks over 35,000 cosmetic and fragrance products from some 800 brands and ships to more than 120 countries worldwide, with a strong focus on the UK market. Earlier this year, Feelunique announced a record-breaking 12 months for the financial year, ended 29 March 2021 with sales increasing by 26%, in context where online purchases surged due to the global pandemic. Earnings before interest, tax and one-off costs (EBITDA) reached £2.5 million - up by £7.5 million from an EBITDA loss of £5 million the previous year. The acquisition of this key pure player also is also in line with Sephora’s ambitions digital ambitions. While not in the same league as Sephora’s global market share, Feelunique is a major player in the British e-commerce beauty market competing with sites such as Lookfantastic (The Hut Group) and Cult Beauty. Furthermore, Feelunique makes most of its sales with millennials and Gen Z consumers."
Anjac Health & Beauty makes innovation strategy more sustainable,"By purchasing five new companies over the past three years – Innovi, Pascual Cosmétiques, Feltor, Cosmetix West and Roval Cosmétiques –, the French group kept on with its external development strategy, becoming a comprehensive leader in cosmetics design and production. With its various expert, complementary units, including Aircos, Chemineau, Euro Wipes, LPEV, Incara, Shadeline, and Sicaf, Anjac Health & Beauty counts 20 production and R&D sites in France, the US, and Spain, and employs over 2,000 people for a consolidated turnover of 400 million euros. “We have become a reference player in Europe. We support all brand profiles, from start-ups to major multinationals, by offering a broad range of products and technologies. We do have a Made-in-France offer, but we are also present in Spain and the US, in California, where our business was boosted starting from 2019,” explains the group’s CEO Aurélien Chauffour. Thanks to this growth strategy and various specializations, Anjac keeps investing in equipment and research to offer innovations driven by sustainability requirements. As an example, they invested in a line of masks with “home compost” ecodesigned materials and 99.9% of ingredients of natural origin, in a new stick packaging line for Pascual Cosmétiques – a makeup, casting, stick, and liquid formula expert – in order to meet customer expectations regarding solid products, and in a newly-built R&D laboratory for skincare and premium texture expert Sicaf Cosmétiques, which multiplied the company’s creation and innovation surface area by ten. Anjac’s innovation strategy is focused on sustainable formulas and packaging. “90% of our innovations have a positive impact on CSR, thanks to environmental and societal benefits and a positive action on consumers’ health. They include solid cosmetics in all forms (sticks, loose powder, pebbles…), an SPF booster which reduces the quantity of UV filters, a food supplement with a highly reduced glycemic index, and a natural alternative to glyphosate designed for other applications,” reveals Marketing & Communication Director Anne Rutigliano. As for packaging, the group boasts many development projects, like Doypacks made of recyclable and compostable PE for Roval, an alternative to virgin plastic based on a 100% natural, compostable material developed by Innovi for injection and extrusion applications, and a recyclable, refillable PCR compact line for Aircos. In addition, Anjac Health & Beauty is the first manufacturer to have worked with Candice Colin’s Beautylitic tool, which was initially intended for distributors to decipher the clean & safe profile of products based on algorithms. Thanks to this partnership with the French startup, the group can now screen all its innovations and part of its products. “This tool makes it possible to characterize and objectify the clean nature of our products in full transparency, compare them to a panel of other marketed products, and address the key issue of ingredient biodiversity and environmental protection. We long anticipated the substitutions and alternatives to controversial ingredients, like silicones, talc, phenoxyethanol, etc. and we offer our customers other solutions,” explains Anne Rutigliano. Guided by these commitments, the Anjac group imposes itself as a major player in an industry undergoing a real value transformation and is already embracing new consumption models."
Givaudan explores multiple ways to make eco-conscious perfumes,"“With Naturality, Givaudan opens up a new olfactory creation chapter by adopting more eco-conscious processes. This approach is in line with the company’s raison d’être: Create with Love for Nature. It is all based on creating perfumes that convey our green commitments: reducing ingredient-related emissions by 20% by 2030 and a positive carbon footprint by 2050,” explains Xavier Renard, Global Head of Fine Fragrances at Givaudan. “Tomorrow’s classics will still provide pleasure and wellness, but they will also meet the urgent requirements needed to protect our planet”. Environmental protection thus lies at the core of the perfumer’s job. “Over the past few years, consumers have grown aware of environmental issues and put them at the same level as the holistic approach,” says Arnaud Guggenbuhl, Marketing Director of Fine Fragrance. To meet this expectation, Givaudan has got most of the company’s teams involved to reduce its perfumes’ environmental impact with two main priorities: revamp the perfumer’s palette with renewable ingredients and guide perfumers towards a greener creative approach. Givaudan puts an emphasis on upcycling by optimizing each resource to create innovative green ingredients. The composition company has managed to obtain a natural peach essence derived from residues of fruit juice production in the US. It is a real technical feat, since they create natural fruit extracts that had not existed so far with a highly reduced environmental impact. The same approach was adopted for green chemistry and synthetic ingredients. Thanks to the Five Carbon Path programme, Givaudan optimizes the synthesis of perfume molecules with two main targets, renewability and biodegradability, based on an energy-efficient synthetic process which generates as little waste as possible, as can be seen with the brand new exclusive captive molecule Ebelia, a fruity note similar to blackcurrant. Biotechnology can also produce highly odorant molecules with a small quantity of renewable materials using transformation processes with a low carbon impact. For example, Ambrofix is obtained with an enzymatic reaction with cane sugar. Formerly derived from a natural material, clary sage, this captive molecule is now based on a renewable resource – a real ecological performance, since it is much popular among perfumers. All these new ingredients cannot but help perfumers formulate differently! To gradually give up on petrochemistry, Givaudan explores all the alternatives available to create a 100% renewable palette of ingredients by 2030. It is a new olfactory language that perfumers need to learn. It involves constraints that open creative doors. Just like the disappearance of nitromusks led to the emergence of sweet notes, these green requirements are allowing a new perfumery to bloom. This palette of renewable ingredients provides much fluidity, harmony and textures, a dimension much appealing to the public. Beyond an exercise in style, this new approach offers perfumers a real playground to work on complex, faceted perfumes that let emotions speak. Indeed, to lighten perfumes’ carbon footprint, revamping the perfumer’s palette is only the first step: formulation should also be rethought. To this aim, Givaudan innovates by reducing the concentration in formulas to 3% or 5%, diminishing the volume of oil and the use of ingredients around the world. As a matter of fact, the new renewable ingredients with a low carbon footprint but strong olfactory power make it possible to create as highly-performing trails despite their low concentration. With the “High-Low” concept (high performance, low carbon impact), Givaudan offers both powerful and green perfumes. In addition, this choice offers perfumers several creative advantages. The low concentrations make it possible to add materials highly limited by IFRA to formulas, while complying with the regulatory limits in force. The combination of these notes with new ingredients also gives a very modern dimension to fragrances. Lastly, the low concentrations make the use of expensive natural materials easier to create more qualitative and sophisticated perfumes. In short, paradoxically, this innovative approach revives more classic perfumery and partially frees aesthetic research from regulatory constraints. If the green and creative benefits of the High Low concept are not visible yet on the market, to Givaudan, this technique represents one of the main paths to tomorrow’s perfumery."
MS Beautilab initiates transformation and goes global,"As the world of cosmetics outsourcing is undergoing profound transformation with a clear concentration on the global level and a massive demand for turnkey products, MS Beautilab — the Beauty Division of the Swiss group Marvinpac — has initiated a historic transformation process under the leadership of Olivier Salaun, the new group CEO, and a new executive committee, and of a board of directors composed of historic Managers and representatives of family shareholders. “We aim to outperform the strong growth expected for outsourcing by tripling our cosmetics turnover by 2025. By then, skincare and makeup should both account for half of our sales,” explains Olivier Salaun. The Marvinpac Group was founded as Strand Cosmetics Europe, a French Lyon-based company specialized in high-end makeup and skincare formulation and production, and Marvinpac, a Swiss specialist of packaging and co-packing, gradually got closer between 2017 and 2020. It is divided into two main Divisions: Marvinpac, for food & beverages, and MS Beautilab, for makeup & skincare – they represent 57% and 43% of the group’s business, respectively. The group counts three production sites: one in the suburbs of Lyon, France, one in Switzerland, near Fribourg, and one in the Czech Republic, near Prague, mainly specialized in packaging. “We have huge assets, for example we succeeded in diversifying our products by adding skincare to makeup, and we boast a very complementary industrial tool in line with market expectations. We are viewed as a reliable player, but we need to enhance our innovation capacities and geographical presence, because we are still too focused on European markets,” says Olivier Salaun. The Beauty Division’s ambitious growth targets will be achieved with considerable investments intended to transform MS Beautilab’s value proposition: the company wants to boost its full-service offering for premium, prestige, and luxury brands and offer more innovations on the most growth-driving segments, like anhydrous cosmetics and natural formulas. Investments will focus in particular on strong growth segments and new segments in the group’s portfolio. “Our expertise will also help us develop anhydrous skincare products with disruptive ambitions in this sector,” adds the CEO. “We will strengthen our capacities in many categories. In certain cases, like powders, we may have to plan an acquisition or an industrial partnership,” he says. All in all, the group’s investments over the next five years should reach several tens million euros, the majority of which will be allocated to the MS Beautilab cosmetics division. If, right now, 90% of MS Beautilab’s sales are achieved in Europe, the idea is to soon enter new markets in North America and Asia. “We want our turnover outside Europe to reach 25% to 33% by 2025,” announces Olivier Salaun. This way, about a third of the group’s sales would be achieved in France and Switzerland, another third in other European countries, and the last third in Asia and North America. To make sure this objective is fulfilled, MS Beautilab has planned to open a sales office in the USA in 2021, with a presence on both the East and West Coasts, and to create a development laboratory focused on makeup in California as soon as late 2022. As for China and Asia, where the company already offers bulk products, they will focus on skincare, in particular for major local and international brands. “We aim to strengthen our presence in Asia, so we have started discussions with various potential partners to have our formulas packed locally.” The company intends to rely on its capacity to offer brands made-in-France and made-in-Switzerland skincare and makeup products – these two origins are very popular in the premium, prestige, and luxury segments. As regards CSR, a strategic roadmap is being finalized with the aim to start implementing it from 2022 in the continuity of our EcoVadis certifications (Gold in Switzerland, and Silver in France and the Czech Republic.) Just like many partners of cosmetics brands, MS Beautilab saw its business considerably change in just a few years, with turnkey finished products now accounting for the main part of the business. According to Olivier Salaun, this change of paradigm involves “thoroughly reorganizing our working methods and customer relationship”. The company aims to provide more and more customers, both major international brands and emerging indie brands, with a full-service offering, by gradually managing a more significant part of the value chain and getting to the all-in-one phase, the objective being to offer not only a formula in a primary pack, but also a comprehensive marketing proposition including both product and pack design and a marketing strategy, in synergy with the expertise and historical know-how of the Marvinpac entity. “MS Beautilab can rely on a strong scientific approach thanks to extensive knowledge as regards the skin, sensoriality and textures. Our work on naturalness provides a unique skincare offering, and we also boast rare expertise in pigments,” emphasizes Camille Schmit Deroin, VP Skincare VP. To improve the customer experience in connection with the Make Up and Skin care Business Units, a ""cosmetics task force and resources dedicated to Marketing and Innovation"" have been created and strengthened within the Group, specifies Jean-Marc Tuffal, VP Marketing & VP innovation. “We need to listen and be able to anticipate needs. We aim to be positioned as a reference made-in-France makeup player, thanks to a strong value proposition and an integrated value chain. With our high-end, made-in-France and made-in-Switzerland skincare offering, we are one of the rare players to be present on both markets,” concludes Olivier Salaun."
"Makeup is back, Aircos and Pascual are ready for action!","How did you live through this particularly severe period for the makeup segment? Thomas Sirot (Aircos) - The fact is that 2020-2021 was a very difficult period for our factories, which saw orders come and go, start and stop. I recognize the efforts of our teams, as they have shown great flexibility both in continuing to serve our customers and in protecting our employees. Thanks to the long-term vision of Aircos and the Anjac group, we maintained our expansion strategy as we reinforced our teams with talent that is focused on innovation: a process industrialization engineer, a marketing manager, a sales manager... and a new Research & Innovation manager. We opened a sales office in the United States in the midst of the turmoil, and we confirmed our intention to open an R&D laboratory alongside our sister company Cosmetix West in California. Our activity in the United States is very important, as making prestigious brands best-sellers is a great satisfaction, but we want to go even further and that requires local proximity and agility. In terms of innovation, we are very dynamic. 2020 and 2021 are accentuated by the launch of lines of cleansing powders that are matching the trend for clean, nomadic and eco-responsible products. As for packaging, we are innovating with the ""Direct-to-Green"" single-material compact, eco-designed with 1 direct filling in the base, without any metal, for easily recyclable full-service solutions. We are developing 100% natural and compostable biosourced solutions thanks to the innovative materials of the Anjac Group’s Innovi Applied Research Laboratory. Grégoire Huet (Pascual) - 2020 was a difficult year, but the brands quickly got back to new product developments for the recovery. ""Color"" offers accessible products that are highly coveted by consumers. For us, 2020-2021 consolidated the rise of R&D and Innovation at Pascual. Our investments in R&D and our Clean expertise are more than ever praised by renowned French luxury brands who are looking for products that are efficient, clean, but also very sensorial. We work closely with them. This challenge is met both in the R&D laboratory and in manufacturing. Pascual offers this particular expertise to its customers, in addition to the flexibility of small batches and the Made in France mark of quality. More than ever, as our customers’ need for agility increases, our know-how in kitting at the gates of Paris is particularly appreciated. We continue to invest in our equipment, after 1 filling line for sticks of all diameters, we are increasing our number of tanks for the production of foundation. We are working on several major launches that will be unveiled soon. What are the most important innovations for this year? Thomas Sirot (Aircos) - In addition to the innovations mentioned above, we continue to innovate on our Livelogy technology platform. This proprietary technology offers unlimited possibilities in color intensity, for stunning finishes, with exceptional sensory aspects that imprint the codes of cream textures. After the metallic effects, we are launching a brand new Ultra Matte formula from Livelogy: ""Very Noir"".  Like a creamy gouache paint, "" Very Noir "" turns into a powder and offers an ultra black, ultra matte coverage, that is simply amazing! The other Aircos major launch, more than 50 Clean and Talc-free makeup and skincare textures! This is the result of years of research. Since 2018, thanks to briefs from trailblazing American Indie Brands, our R&D has been working to replace the ""unwanted"" talc, increase naturality to over 90%, and guarantee makeup results to make conventional formulas blush. Grégoire Huet (Pascual) - Clearly for Pascual, innovation means offering Clean performance and sensorial foundations in emulsion and stick as well as lipsticks that reach extreme naturality rates of 99%. Like all Anjac companies, we use the Beautylitic tool to qualify our formulas and compare them with market leaders, and they all come out with flying colors! Our new ""Sweet Lip Oils"" collection to revolutionize lip glosses with a Makeup-Care approach! Ultra-clean, 98% natural, vegan, for a wide choice of ""fresh and tangy"" looks enriched with key ingredients. There is no doubt about the makeup dynamic within the Anjac group. A range of innovations and new services are already in the pipeline for 2022."
"LAST, the first longwear makeup line based on green isododecane","The secret for longwear, no-transfer or waterproof makeup mainly lies in a synthetic molecule which used to be exclusively petrochemical: isododecane. Thanks to the research done by French biotechnology company Global Bioenergies, this flagship cosmetic ingredient is now available in a biosourced version obtained by fermenting plant resources. In 2008, the startup started working on an alternative to petrochemical isododecane derived from biomass to create a more environmentally friendly supply chain. “Our concept was mainly aimed to have bacteria produce molecules they don’t naturally produce. That used to be considered impossible,” explains Marc Delcourt, co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies. Twelve years later, this process with countless applications (fuel, plastic, food…) is marketed for the first time in the cosmetics industry, a key sector for this ingredient essential to long-lasting makeup. “Isododecane in longwear makeup is the core of the issue. This market represents no less than 4% of the cosmetics market in value. We are the only ones to produce a biosourced isododecane, so only we have the key for naturalness on this growth-driving market with a high demand. It is a unique opportunity,” says the CEO. Thanks to its hold throughout the day and night, during outdoor activities, and in damp environments, long-lasting, waterproof or no-transfer makeup does have a public expecting high performance, colours… and naturalness. This ingredient can also be used as an emollient in various dermocosmetic or hair care formulas as a substitute for silicones, which are about to be banned due to environmental issues. “We started by launching the LAST brand in June, with small production volumes. Then, starting from 2022, we will make this ingredient available to makeup players willing to replicate what we have just done. People are already knocking on our door. Within the next three or four years, we will considerably increase production volumes to target broader markets, like dermocosmetics and hair care,” announces Marc Delcourt. The brand introduces itself as the first to offer longwear makeup with highly natural formulas that do not compromise on vibrant colours. They have developed twelve intense, matte or iridescent colours for liquid eye shadows that last 24 hours. The formulas contain 90% to 99.8% of ingredients of natural origin. The same goes for the three waterproof, black, blue or brown mascara references with 90% of ingredients of natural origin, and the three brow mascara shades with 95% of ingredients of natural origin. The products are free from controversial ingredients and perfume. The eye shadow bottles are made of glass, the caps are based on metal. The mascara bottles and caps are based on recycled plastic, while the brush is biosourced and derived from castor oil. Available on the colors-that-last.com e-shop since June, the brand should soon enter selective distribution networks in France with a price range from EUR 18 to EUR 25. A lipstick line based on the same concept will complete the offering as soon as September. By launching LAST, Global Bioenergies has made a huge step forward, bringing naturalness to a cosmetic segment where it was almost nowhere to be found. This disruptive approach made the public-listed company [1] change its industrial organization by transferring all equipment from the initial site in Germany to that of Pomacle, in Eastern France."
"Hygienic and greener, Livcer adapts its monodoses to current expectations","Founded in 1988, the family business has acquired unique expertise in the cosmetics sector in the design and production of thermoformed parts, ideally suited to single-dose product testing, at home or at the point of sale (POS) or for sales products. The thermoforming technology applied to plastic sheets allows producing simple or complex shapes of any size, quickly and at very competitive prices. It is suitable for a wide variety of textures - liquids, powders, creams, cushions, or solids - and usages, through vertical or horizontal filling. Whether for product testing or the manufacture of single-dose cures, Livcer primarily serves the make-up and skincare segments, with the emphasis on a premium consumer experience, in compliance with environmental, hygiene and safety requirements. ""Leveraging on twenty years of experience in the production of thermoformed doses, we are constantly developing, with the help of our clients and suppliers, a wide range of innovations to make the sample and the single-dose a product with real added value. In 2020, our consumption patterns and habits have fundamentally changed as a result of the pandemic,"" explains Aude de Livonnière, CEO of the company. The company quickly adapted its offer and accelerated its innovation in response to the new hygiene requirements imposed in POS by the health context. The Livstick, launched in 2020 to allow the safe testing of lipstick, is an example of this. The sample comes in the form of a stick made of wood, cardboard or recycled plastic, the tip of which is coated with a small amount of lipstick; the whole of it is slipped into an eco-designed unit blister pack made of over 60% recycled material. ""The Livstick allows the consumer to test the product in total confidence. It can be distributed as a sample for home testing or as an in-store tester,"" emphasises Aude de Livonnière. Livcer has also expanded its catalogue to include thermoformed doses or blisters in even more minimalist formats, of 2ml or even 0.5ml, which correspond to the exact dose of formula to be tested. The necessary eco-design of products increasingly involves the use of green alternatives to traditionally used materials. This includes the elimination of aluminium foil in favour of paper and the use of mono-material laminates made from recycled plastic. All the product and marketing information intended for the consumer can also be printed directly on the blister pack of the dose. This technological advance eliminates the need to add the associated cardboard packaging. ""Eco-sourced materials are starting to appear and we are studying various sources, such as coconut and hemp fibres. The green attitude is not a passing trend but a real issue that is part of a work-in-progress approach. We are intensifying tests to offer a range of solutions that would suit each cosmetic formula,"" adds the Head of the company. Committed with Ecocert for many years, Livcer achieved the Gold level of recognition following its Ecovadis evaluation, thus placing itself in the 5% of companies with the best ratings by this organization."
Ex Nihilo boosts development on international stage,"Founded by Benoît Verdier, Sylvie Loday, and Olivier Royère, experts in finance, consulting, and marketing, the brand opened its first store 352 Rue Saint-Honoré, in Paris, in late 2013. Since then, Ex Nihilo has stood out in the most beautiful niche perfume places: Harrods in London, Tsum in Moscow, Bergdorf Goodman and Saks in NYC. In Paris, it is available at Galeries Lafayette Haussmann and Champs-Élysées, and will soon be at La Samaritaine, as soon as it reopens. Ex Nihilo’s strength lies in its choice of addictive creations combining exceptional natural materials and innovative synthetic captive molecules, but above all, in the unique shopping experience the company offers – an integral part of its DNA. Thanks to Osmologue, an exclusive technology aimed to personalize two collections (Initiale and Babylone) with beautiful ingredients, the brand makes almost tailor-made perfumes on request, while adapting them to customers’ tastes. The Osmologue technology was installed at the Paris store as soon as the brand was created, and then it was replicated at Harrods, in London, and in the two NYC corners. It is also available at the current points of sale in Toronto, at Saks, and in Dubai, at Bloomingdale’s, creating a unique immersive experience. This original and attractive concept offers sophisticated, semi-tailor-made fragrances twisted with beautiful materials selected upstream by Givaudan perfumers to ensure a harmonious olfactory result. The bottle cap can also be personalized for a real high-end experience. All in all, Ex Nihilo boasts 42 creations signed by various junior and senior perfumers, including Quentin Bisch, Guillaume Flavigny, Nathalie Gracia-Cetto, Olivier Pécheux… This large choice of perfumes makes up five collections, where the Parisian style mixes with more oriental scents. What’s more, the brand has multiplied artistic collaborations to offer exclusive perfumes or limited editions. The whole range is well-adapted to layering, thanks to perfumed bases and light body and hair mists that intensify fragrance trails. References like Fleur Narcotique, Venenum Kiss, Vétiver Moloko, and Gold Immortals are the brand’s bestsellers. For example, Fleur Narcotique is highly successful in Russia and Eastern European countries, one of Ex Nihilo’s main markets, alongside the Middle East. Europe and the USA do not lag far behind though: there are about 20 points of sale in North America, mostly on the East coast, from Miami to Toronto, at Saks, but also in NYC – and of course, there is the Lucky Scent digital network. After a year 2020 marked by the closure of many physical stores, the brand is about to speed up its development on the international stage, in particular in California. In addition to a corner at Saks, in Beverly Hills, they are planning to open a flagship store in West Hollywood next October. All in all, the company has scheduled to double the number of points of sale in the year to come. Other than in LA, California, they will unveil a new flagship store in Dubai next September: these two new places will offer the innovative Osmologue technology and will be adorned with Ex Nihilo’s aesthetic codes, with a “local” colour touch. Also with a view to strengthen its presence on the international stage, the brand is planning to settle in Asia. After opening a first point of sale in Korea this year, the founders are now much interested in China, a new playground for niche perfume brands. Global expansion is not the only challenge for Ex Nihilo. Over the next few months, it will be crucial to adapt sustainability requirements to luxury codes. And of course, there is digitalism: the in-store experience should be put forward on the social media – it just cannot be ignored, to Benoît Verdier – in particular to reach the GenZ and Millennials. Ex Nihilo will have many other projects to work on over the next few months, including the launch of a new fragrance after summer, with a captive molecule extracted from patchouli: akilagawood. While the synthetic molecules highlighted help preserve the environment, the company has not overlooked the beautiful natural materials that guarantee their perfumes’ quality. And they are ready to make them more widely known abroad."
"Essentia Beauty, new brand Ozmee’s incubator partner","Specialized for 20 years in the turnkey creation, development, and production of skincare, makeup and fragrances, Essentia Beauty has spent the past five years investing and structuring the company’s innovations around a consumer-centric approach. “We aim to find out how to provide an added value on an oversaturated market,” explains CEO Katia de Martino. Several innovative packaging and formulation solutions resulted from these efforts, the top priority being sustainability. For example, they now offer solid perfumes in different forms, like Chubby Click, a 100% natural fragrance available as a refillable premium stick or a refillable pendent fitted with a patented sliding and locking system. “Solid perfumes are more than a trend: they meet many expectations, in particular young people’s, because they are eager for new gestures. And to us, the possibility to refill the product is the most efficient sustainable strategy. We are committed to offering the best options in this field,” says Katia de Martino. The Smart Palette makeup concept is in line with this strategy. Various cosmetics – eye shadow, mascara, blush, lipstick – are showcased in only one compact, refillable case. Also, Fan Lipstick, whose design can be customized, is fitted with a retractable mirror to guarantee users a convenient gesture. In addition to these developments, the successful Cosmos-certified makeup line launched for Monoprix helped Essentia get through hard times during the crisis 2020 and still be one step ahead. This line required two years of R&D to achieve optimum finish and comfort performances. In 2021, the company’s commitment for innovation and the search for sustainable solutions urged them to adopt an original support strategy targeting young companies and to add the brand incubator service to their business model. “We have built partnerships with three new brands. We support them according to their own needs and help them with their marketing strategy and positioning to provide an actual added value,” explains the CEO. One of them, Ozmee, will be launched in June in Italy through its e-shop. The concept is based on a mascara offering tailor-made to each morphotype. The diagnosis is based on a mere selfie according to five criteria: length, thickness, volume, quantity, and curvature. “This is made possible thanks to an exclusive, patented facial analysis software based on artificial intelligence,” explains Katia de Martino. According to the CEO, this high-level customization concept is in line with the brand’s sustainable strategy focused on cosmetics waste reduction. “Ozmee’s mission consists in reducing waste by helping consumers find the product best-adapted to their own needs,” she explains. Essentia Beauty aims to strengthen its position among European turnkey solution leaders, while still investing in China, where the company opened a subsidiary already three years ago."
GK Concept launches new in-store contactless testing device,"The French company had already developed Paperscent, a contactless technology launched in 2018 to test perfumes on paper in physical stores. This time, the self-sufficient test provides an answer adapted to all viscosities. Paperscent is designed to replace testing bottles: this compact case integrated to the store’s furniture can be personalized by the brands. It delivers a card that is instantaneously sprayed with perfume and personalized. “Customers want to be on their own when they go shopping. Our technologies are designed to arouse consumers’ curiosity: they act as ‘traffic stoppers’. Thanks to Paperscent, we observed an increase in the number of tests carried out, which in turn increased sales by 30%. It is also a way to preserve olfactory quality: the spray delivers the right dose of perfume directly from the bottle, but since this happens inside the case, you do not have all sorts of smells diffused in the store,” explains Arthur Hagiage, President of GK Concept. Building upon the success of Paperscent, which several major brands have already adopted, GK Concept decided to apply the same concept to cosmetics testing, in particular skincare and makeup testing. Based on the same principle, this technology lies in a highly compact case which easily mingles with the store’s furniture and can be personalized: it can detect movements to deliver the right dose of fluid, whatever the viscosity. “Since our machine is small, you can put 33 of them in one linear metre, which is pretty interesting for the whole range of foundation shades, for example. But Dropper works with all types of liquid products, creams, foundations, serums, perfumes…” says Arthur Hagiage. Just like with Paperscent, the dose of product is directly taken from the brand’s bottle or jar. The system can adapt to the container size to avoid any repacking and protects the formula from any external contamination. The case is either plugged or powered with a battery. For controlled, continuous use, it is connected, so beauty advisors are directly informed with a notification when the device should be recharged. “The success of our technologies lies in their being constantly functional: we have developed our own in-store predictive, easy-to-use maintenance system,” adds the President. The made-in-France Dropper electronic technology is in line with the current redefinition of in-store testing, which should now be contactless. Already familiar with hand sanitizer dispensing technology based on movement detection, consumers can now discover the experience of safe self-sufficient testing. And for brands, it is an opportunity to provide a low-cost solution."
Sicaf Cosmétiques is stepping up its innovation and supports the market recovery,"Premium Beauty News - Sicaf has recently invested in a new R&D centre, what are its objectives? Lionel De Deken - This is a major concern for us. This new site allows us to grow with innovative projects. It has been sized to meet our growth ambition for the next 10 years. It will be an important tool for the consolidation of our industrial and R&D capabilities. This new building is home to some 20 people and can accommodate up to 40. It has a laboratory organised into formulation islands, with a surface area three times that of our previous facilities. Pierre Planès - This new R&D centre is organised into several poles. A pole dedicated to prospective and technology watch, to create innovative textures. As well as specialised development centres which, based on our customers’ briefs and the work of the prospective team, develop high-performance, bespoke products. All of this is, of course, supported by a regulatory department that ensures the compliance of formulas. This allows us to propose two or three prospective collections each year, inspirational formulas that we present to our customers to illustrate our capabilities, and feed their development strategy. In addition, the laboratory takes part in the cross-functional projects of the Anjac Health & Beauty Group. Premium Beauty News - Precisely how are the synergies organised between the Sicaf R&D and the other entities of the Group? Pierre Planès - Anjac has an R&D Committee that I chair. It is a place where information is fed back and shared between our different entities, but also where technological innovations and highly specialised products are created and developed. Lionel De Deken - The twelve entities of the Group [1] offer a unique development and deployment potential. Their complementarity allows for rapid transfers of knowledge and expertise. When customers submit projects to us, they are transferred to the most appropriate entity. We also offer synergies between regions, for example in some cases Sicaf formulates for a US brand and our US subsidiary, Cosmetix West, takes care of the manufacturing in the US. Premium Beauty News - What are Sicaf’s main lines of research and innovation today? Lionel De Deken - Our strategy of growth and differentiation is based on the creation of disruptive and innovative formulas. We are recognised as skincare experts, specialising in hot cast products (balms, deodorants, solid cosmetics) and powder micro-dosing. We also have a long and valued history of expertise in fragrance derivatives, which has given us a rare ability to work on highly concentrated fragrance formulations. Our top priority is to meet the expectations of our customers, major French and international brands operating in the masstige, premium and luxury segments, who are looking for effective formulas with a very distinctive sensory signature. Pierre Planès - Overall, clean beauty is the segment that is experiencing the strongest growth. To better address this trend, the Anjac Health & Beauty Group has joined forces with Beautylitic, the scientific analysis and evaluation tool for beauty formulas, which allows us to advise our customers right from the product design phase. Also, another major research focus is obviously on natural, organic and sustainable formulas. We aim to offer the highest levels of naturalness and sustainability, without compromising the sensoriality that consumers are used to. This can be a real challenge, especially for solid products where our expertise in hot casting is a huge asset. These solid formulas are becoming increasingly popular because they are a good fit with current concerns. They contain little or no water, require little or no preservatives and therefore offer high levels of naturalness and do not require complex packagings. Our researchers are truly focused on providing the next generation of solids, the one that comes closest to traditional skincare textures. Already in 2019, we received an award for this at the Cosmétagora trade show. Even for creams, switching to natural textures without silicone that are as effective in terms of sensoriality requires a lot of research. This is also innovation! This know-how is truly the distinguishing feature of Sicaf. Premium Beauty News - How did you deal with the health crisis? Lionel De Deken - Despite the difficulties, it has been a very rewarding period. We bounced back very quickly by producing hydroalcoholic gels to make up for the drop in revenue during the first months of the crisis. We used the opportunity to rework our organisation and our future strategy. We have continued to invest in R&D, suspended lower-priority investments and retained all our teams to be ready for the upturn. Some of our customers have bounced back very quickly too by turning to direct sales and the Internet, others have reorganised themselves, and others took advantage of the recovery in Asia. Today, we respond to requests that are sometimes very demanding. In summary, I can say that we have emerged from the crisis stronger than ever!"
What Matters combines elegance and ecology in home and body care products,"Premium Beauty News - You launched What Matters a few months ago. How is the project doing now? Charlotte Caton - We are very satisfied with what we have done so far. We launched our brand in September 2020 in D2C with about fifty references: skincare, hygiene, and home products. Hygiene products are packed in white bottles, while home care products are presented in brown bottles. The refills are made of flexible plastic to reduce our consumption. We have chosen a comprehensive offering to meet all families’ needs. What Matters is a unique concept of refillable products packed in very smart bottles made of reinforced, secured glass. It is a patented technology developed by French glassmaker Verescence which guarantees the bottles’ integrity: they cannot break down into pieces, even if they fall on your bathroom tiles. We are pioneers in the use of this technology, and although, initially, we did not ask for significant volumes, Verescence followed us, so they could put forward and valorize their outstanding know-how. We boast a broad range, but there are few products in each of them – most are gender-free. All products are fitted with pumps to adjust the dose with optimum accuracy. We provide dose recommendations, including the number of times users need to press on the pump: the idea is to consume less, but better. Our products have got good marks on Yuka. These sensorial, pleasant-to-use formulas are made in France and certified organic. Premium Beauty News - What about sales? Charlotte Caton - Our customers are really free, but we do help them as much as possible so they gain time: standard purchases, guided purchases, re-orders in a single click, or recurring orders. This flexible system without obligation makes it possible for them to order only what they need. We help our customers evaluate their needs according to their personal situation: in a relationship, family, house-sharing… They can place three or four orders before they subscribe. Due to the crisis, people have spent a lot of time at home lately, and it boosted our business. We have already sold over 145,000 products (50% of bottles and 50% of refills). But above all, we have recorded a repurchase rate of 46%. We adopted a 100% digital model, which means customers cannot test our products before buying them, so it proves they like them. In any case, online selling and social media provide direct, unlimited feedback. Our subscribers’ opinion is a precious source of information. Our most popular products are toothpaste and hand wash. We believe we have helped our customers save three tonnes and a half of plastic since our brand was launched! All our packaging is recyclable, our cardboard’s height can be adjusted, and we manage our deliveries according to frequency rather than product, so our orders are not scattered. So, we deliver every month, or every two or three months, depending on the needs. Now, what we need to do is broaden our distribution network. We will open up to retail starting from the end of the year in stores like Printemps. We have placed our third order: our suppliers will produce 450,000 more bottles for us. We are also considering opening our first points of sale for export as soon as 2022, in French-speaking countries at first, like Belgium and Switzerland, where we already have customers thanks to the web, and then in Spain and Germany. Premium Beauty News - Have you planned other developments? Charlotte Caton - We have developed a B2B range with 5-litre refills for hotels and B&Bs. Single-use plastic will soon be banned in hotels – there is a strong demand in this sector. As for products, we are about to launch a two-in-one shampoo-shower gel for kids with a refillable metal foamer. We are also preparing a hair conditioner, a BB cream, and shaving foam. In the home category, we plan to launch a fabric softener. As regards bestsellers, we are also working on powders that can be diluted, so we no longer need to transport water and can further reduce packaging. But we do not want to make any compromise over sensoriality. However, we also try to fight against hypersegmentation. That is why we only offer two toothpaste models: one for adults, the other for kids. Premium Beauty News - The segment that grows the fastest is sustainable cosmetics, but it is also the most glutted. Charlotte Caton - We do not target activists; rather customers who want to change practices but do not really know where to start. But above all, we believe we should help people change using pleasure, not fear or constraints – supermarket customers who want something different. Our clientele is mainly composed of families with children: they need practical, concrete solutions. Our mission consists in helping them gain time by delivering them products when they need them – and never more! – and on which they can count with their eyes shut! We stand out thanks to our balance between a premium design and an affordable price. People are seduced by our beautiful offering, they repurchase their products because they are good ones, and they are faithful to our brand because it helps be effortlessly ecoresponsible."
WWP Beauty establishes itself as a global full service partner,"Headquartered in New Jersey, the company is well known for its rigid packaging and extruded tubes for the makeup and skincare markets. However, the acquisition of Cosmetic Design Group and Design Quest in 2019, both based in the Los Angeles area, enabled WWP to diversify its offer, in particular in full turnkey design services. Today, full service represents 40% of the group’s global turnover. “Cosmetic Design Group was fully integrated to form WWP Beauty by the end of 2020. This integration was about being the source for everything beauty to our customers, expanding our capabilities to include a full service offering of packaging, formulation, full service turnkey and accessories, and increasing our global footprint with the openings of our EMEA office in Paris, France and our APAC office in Shanghai, China,” explains Josh Kirschbaum, CEO. At the beginning of this year, WWP Beauty unveiled its new brand identity, with a new logo, a new website and a redefined discourse and business outlook. While the beauty industry as a whole experienced a slight drop during the beginning of the global pandemic, WWP Beauty used this time to evolve and expand its product portfolio, and to prepare for the increased demand that we anticipated for post-COVID. “Today, our company is not only focused on quickly evolving our brand to meet the ever-changing needs of our customers, but also on ensuring that we are providing every customer with solutions that are sustainable, clean, compliant, and inclusive,” added Kirschbaum. Even though many people know WWP Beauty for their solutions in color cosmetics, over the last year the group has shown agility in bringing sustainable packaging, formulation, and accessories solutions that span into categories like skincare, fragrance and hair care. “With turnkey being a preferred service by many brands, this year we have launched our Es•sence fragrance collection and two new skincare collections; Bluelight and Twilight,” said Kirschbaum. Developped in partnership with Scentinvent Technologies, Es•sence is a new solid fragrance format that features skin-loving ingredients, and allows the brand to play with color, scent and packaging to create a truly unique fragrance experience. The Bluelight collection features skincare products that contain bluelight technology which helps protect the skin from the harmful effects that come from HEV lights emitted from technological devices such as TV, smartphones and computer screens. As for Twilight, it is a collection of products that focusing on the night time beauty ritual with comforting tactile textures formulations, packaging and accessories that help enhance the selfcare experience and bring calm and joy to at-home skincare. As far as packaging is concerned, sustainability is the key area of innovation for the company. To help their customers evaluate the different options, WWP Beauty has developed a tool that called Eco Analyzer. Two of WWP Beauty latest sustainable packaging launches were ran through the Eco Analyzer. The Eco Pac Tube uses 19% less plastic per piece, and reduces GHG emissions by up to 93% in comparison to a standard tube of the same size. The ColorVue lipstick features a mono-material design and a patent pending mechanism that uses up to 12% less plastic and reduces GHG emissions by up to 85% in comparison to a standard lipstick component of the same size. Additionally, in 2021 the company has also launched a Refillable Body Stick, Refillable Multi-use Face Stick, Refillable Bottle, and a Square Tube available in PCR material."
"“Retail is not dead, it just needs to be better,” says Malina Ngai, AS Watson","“Forget physical versus online. It’s not either or; O+O is the new standard for retail,” explained Malina Ngai, Group COO of A.S. Watson Group & CEO of A.S. Watson (Asia & Europe) speaking at the inaugural Beauty Tech Live industry event. According to Ngai, the O+O (Offline plus Online) concept simply describes how customers shop today, but it is very different from the traditional O2O (online to offline or offline to online) strategies. “It is more about creating an integrated experience to better serve customers’ needs, that enables them to shop across any channel, anytime, anywhere.” And there are huge business consequences, as there is no cannibalisation in customers’ spending in physical stores. “In fact, an O+O customer spends three times what an instore-only customer shops with us. It’s about creating bigger share of wallet and higher customer lifetime value,” Ngai added. Combining physical and online stores is a great challenge for the A.S. Watson which operates over 16,000 physical stores and 100 e-commerce platforms in 27 markets between Asia and Europe, under brands such as Watsons, Kruidvat, Superdrugs, Drogas, Rossmann, ICI Paris XL, Marionnaud, The Perfume Shop. In order for the O+O to be efficient, it relies on “a combination of our extensive physical store network as core touchpoints, our 140,000-strong customer service workforce, integrated with digital platforms, and most importantly, the customer connectivity with our base of 139 millions loyalty members we’ve built over the past few years,” said Ngai. However, O+O is not just having physical and online stores connected. “It’s an ecosystem that is powered by technology, big data and artificial intelligence. Just as important, it’s an organisation cultural change when it comes to managing the business and prioritisation.” In this context, all of the group’s physical stores are connected to digital platforms, which means the product offering is no longer limited by shelf space. In a few clicks, store teams can order products for deliveries or pick-up by customers. A.S. Watson also enables members of its loyalty programs to shop online not only on A.S. Watson’s mobile apps and websites, but also via WeChat or WhatsApp. For example, in Watsons China, customers can seek personalised advice from in-store beauty advisors via Enterprise WeChat and enjoy one-to-one service. The advisor can suggest personalised promotion offers with the help of artificial intelligence engine, help order the products from the cloud service MyStore (WeChat platform tailored for Watsons) and customers can receive product delivery within one hour. To offer a seamless retail experience and keep customers engaged, A.S. Watsons has doubled its development of digital assets and contents over the last 12 months, as well as its fulfilment capacities to cope with the surging demand through picking in stores. The aim was to be able to deliver ordered products within hours. “Customers of all generations are now increasingly mobile savvy and digitally connected,” highlighted Malina Ngai. A.S. Watsons therefore chose to focus on developments using customers’ own mobile phone to align with their daily habits. With WatsonsGO, for instance, customers to buy in store via payment on mobile app. First launched in Watsons China, the service is now available in Watsons Hong Kong and Singapore. With Go-In-Store, customers who browse online can speak to an instore beauty or health advisor on video to get consultation. On line tools, such as Skin Analyser, ColourMe, or Virtual Foundation Trial use virtual reality and artificial intelligence to provide recommendations or make virtual try-ons. In stores, a touch screen dubbed Endless Aisle, allows customers to shop and choose either to collect the products in store or have them delivered to their home. Also, A.S. Watson has partnered up with delivery service Grab in order for customers in Southeast Asia to get their delivery in only less than two hours. Converting more customers to O+O will be A.S. Watson core growth strategy in 2021 and beyond. However, physical stores will continue to play a significant role in the whole beauty shopping experience, and the group plans to open 1,000 new stores this year. “Retail is not dead; it just needs to be better for our customers,” concluded Malina Ngai."

Asquan is committed to protecting the oceans and the environment,"In front of this situation, Asquan lauches the Ocean Waste Collection Program, to use innovation to support eco-systems and protect the oceans. At Asquan, besides using recycled or eco materials and integrating recyclability in the core of our designs, we decided to be more innovative and go beyond our business model. We believe in an industry that globally preserves the environment and values people. Starting in 2020, we decided to contribute to the recovery and the recycling of ocean-waste plastics. Our goal is to reduce Ocean plastic waste ,whilst at the same time improving the lives of our society’s most underprivileged living in countries with poor waste management infrastructure. The ecosystem put in place creates a recycling infrastructure and invites locals to earn a stable income by joining recycling forces. Through the use of blockchain technology, collectors can increase their income by exchanging the collected plastic waste for tokens that in turn can further be exchanged for food, money, housing, education tuition and health insurance. Asquan is working towards this goal through our Ocean Waste Collection Program (OWCP) which has both positive environmental and social impacts. Asquan initiated the OWCP in Q4 2020, where approx. 20 tons of ocean waste was recovered, equivalent to approx. 1 million 500 ml plastic water bottles. This year, Asquan is committed to continue the momentum and reach 2 million+ plastic bottles or a total 40 tons. Our efforts contribute to the development of recycling eco-systems in areas that have among the most deficient solid waste management infrastructures. This accessibility to recycling improves the materials recovery, helps in developing a circular economy, and stops plastic leaking into the environment. Asquan’s OWCP initiative is aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), a global framework offering the best path forward to collaborate on solving society’s biggest problems and challenges. By participating in the collection of ocean plastic waste, Asquan contributes to clean up our oceans as well as supporting the SDG14: Conserving our Oceans. By allowing local people to collect and exchange plastic waste for money and services, the OWCP initiative improves access to employment, health and education which in turn contributes to the SDGs 3, 4 & 8: Good Health and Wellbeing, Quality Education and Decent Work and Economic Growth. By joining forces in this movement against plastic pollution, we generate true added value and help tackle some of the world’s major issues i.e.: plastic waste and poverty. Asquan believes that this way, we develop strong partnerships towards sustainable development, consistent with SDG17: Partnerships for Sustainable Development. Asquan’s ambition is to pursue this path towards sustainability and collect ever more plastic waste. Brands can support our social and environmental aspiration by trusting us with their business. Every project made with us contributes to reducing ocean plastic!"
KDC/One wants to grow in Asia and focuses on sustainable beauty,"Acquisition after acquisition, KDC/One has grown as a one-stop-shop provider for many beauty categories. The group now generates 62% of its turnover in the beauty and personal care sector and 38% in home care. However, KDC/One is still very focused on North America, which currently accounts for 75% of its business, compared to 18% for Europe and Middle East, and only 7% for Asia. With their most recent acquisitions, KDC/One focused on adding their capabilities and broadening their geographic footprint. This was most significantly accomplished through the acquisition of Benchmark, HCT and Paristy. As a formulation development powerhouse, specifically focused on indie and emerging brands, Benchmark helps KDC/One to strengthen their position in this fast-growth segment. The addition of HCT, a leading packaging design and production firm in the prestige cosmetics industry, to KDC’s portfolio buoyed their presence with prestige color and skincare brands and enhances their ability to provide a “one stop shop” for those clients seeking a full-service solution encompassing both package and product. Following the acquisition of Alkos and Swallowfield, which enabled the group to gain a foothold in Europe, KDC/One set foot in Asia by taking over Paristy, with manufacturing based in Shanghai and R&D in Taiwan. “Paristy provides a base for expansion into the high growth Chinese Beauty market. The business offers world class technology in lip, eye and complexion products that complement and enhance existing capabilities at Kolmar in the US, as well as Alkos and Inter Cosmétiques in France,” said Wayne Swanton, President Beauty & Personal Care at KDC. In order to increase its focus in that market ensuring to be able to meet their increased demand and be fully prepared to service its customers’ needs in the region, the group has recently added a Head of Asia. In line with the major trends of the moment, KDC/One is currently concentrating its innovations on sustainability. “In working with our Brand Partners, we are able to deliver high-performance technologies in an effort to help minimize the ecological and global footprint. Our talented R&D Teams collaborate to offer advancements in waterless technology, cold process manufacturing, and incorporating sustainable ingredients to create more transparency for consumers,” underlines Wayne Swanton. As far as packaging is concerned, KDC/One mainly relies on the capabilities of HCT. At the end of 2020, the company launched CLT (which stands for Crimpless Tube Technology), a new tube collection designed to stand above the limitations of typical tubes by unlocking new aesthetic possibilities and functionalities. In addition, the HCT team strives to increase sustainable options for its customers, through the use of recycled plastics, bioplastics as well as refillable packaging solutions."
Surya Brasil records double digit growth and aims for Africa,"With hair and beauty salons shut down across Brazil for much of 2020 - a scenario that repeated in early 2021 - hair dye addicts had only two options: opt for a more natural look and assume their grey hair, or dyeing their hair themselves. Those who have opted for the second solution have contributed to the growth of the category in the country. “Our sales of hair dyes in Brazil increased by 15% compared to 2019,” says Clelia Angelon, CEO of Surya Brasil, a company she founded 25 years ago. A result well above the 3% that the company announced to Brazil Beauty News in June, at the outset of the pandemic in the country. Henna is at the heart of the company’s portfolio of natural and vegan products. “Our henna cream is easy to apply, ready to use, has no unpleasant odour and contains 93.61% ingredients of natural origin. It is compatible with all chemically treated hair (straightening or other). It covers and protects grey hair from the very first application. Our henna powder is 100% natural and vegetable. It colours and treats the hair, giving it intense shine and forming a protective film around the hair fibre,” explains the founder of the brand. In addition to henna products and colouring accessories, the brand’s catalogue includes shampoos, conditioners and hair care masks. Like many cosmetic brands, Surya Brasil recently launched its own alcoholic gel and fabric masks for the prevention of Covid-19. It was in drugstore chains, which never ceased their operations in Brazil during the epidemic, that Surya Brasil experienced the most significant growth last year: +27% compared to 2019. However, according to Clelia Angelon sales also rose in supermarkets and online. “Although 2020 has been very difficult for companies in Brazil, for Surya Brasil it has been a very rewarding time. We have invested in digital and in our team and we have been surprised by the strong demand for our products from national and international distributors,” she adds. Surya Brasil’s products are already available in more than 40 countries. The company entered the African continent last year, in particular in Congo, Kenya and South Africa. “The African continent offers a very promising business potential for Surya Brasil. Our formulations are ideal for the afro hair,” says the CEO. In 2020, the brand also debuted in India, Colombia and Costa Rica. ""Our sales are growing in the different markets where our products are available yet"", adds Angelon. For 2021, the brand intends to enter new African countries and is also working to conquer more space on the Asian continent. In addition to expanding its export sales, the company is also aiming at strengthening its position in Brazil, particularly online. According to its projections, growth in 2021 should continue at an even faster rate as the previous year, around 20%."
Parfums de Marly: a flagship French niche perfume brand,"In 2009, Julien Sprecher, a renowned olfactory expert in the perfume sector, used his broad knowledge of juices to create a collection of perfumes with powerful, statement notes. Les Parfums de Marly soon imposed itself as a pioneer in the fledgling niche perfume sector. On this market, which put forward unisex fragrances, the creator chose well-identified men’s and women’s lines. “Although we do have a few unisex references, Julien Sprecher deeply believes in the added value of a gendered collection. This way, we explore many more olfactory notes… and go much further,” explains Julien Sausset, CEO of the brand. A few years later, Les Parfums de Marly collection counts about thirty fragrances. Most of them are men’s perfumes, but the bestseller was designed for women: the Delina perfume with rose/rhubarb notes is available in different versions, including the latest Delina La Rosée. Les Parfums de Marly has also imposed itself as one of the first five niche brands in American department stores. “We have just achieved 130 million euros in retail, including 50 with sales in the United States, our largest market,” says Julien Sausset. The brand has also been successful for two years in the Middle East and Brazil. “Our juices are marked: they are either very masculine or very feminine, which appeals a lot to Brazilians. These consumers like to assert their tastes, they are very sensitive to our classics”, adds the CEO. Julien Sausset also revealed to us the opening of two points of sale in Shanghai and Beijing – about twenty others should open in China within the next 12 months. “Much is happening in China right now, especially among the 25/35-year-old generation. Tastes are changing fast. The belief that we should launch fresh juices there is less and less true: young people have started changing habits and taking interest in niche, statement perfumes. There is a real perfume culture coming.” Just like for many other niche brands, the French market is not the most dynamic. “I think niche perfumes will grow in France, but the French are not very keen on bold perfumes. They are still pretty traditional compared to new markets, where these new luxury dynamics are more widely observed,” says Julien Sausset. If the perfume market’s growth remains moderate, niche perfumes are very dynamic. With their bold notes, they often embody innovation and creativity. “Similarly to what happened with wine, people started taking interest in vines, quality, small producers… they understood that we could do much better with a bit more money. It is the same with perfumes: consumers are interested in ingredients, long wear… All this makes the user experience stronger. It is said that customers do not go back once they have tested a niche perfume. This more qualitative type of perfumery can no longer be considered a ‘niche’ – it will actually play a huge role in defining the future of perfumes,” says Julien Sausset. New gestures, new olfactory notes, green approach to juices and packaging… Boldness is indeed often associated with this alternative segment. And as successful as they are, Les Parfums de Marly aim to keep working in this direction."
"“Brands have a responsibility to use sustainable resources,” Susanne Kaufmann","You have been advocating for a holistic approach to beauty for almost 20 years now. How do you explain the fact that the concept is only now catching on in the mainstream in countries like France or the United States? Susanne Kaufmann - I think beauty is increasingly moving in a holistic direction, something I’ve always believed in since I started my skincare brand. We all know now that the perfect combination of exercise, nutrition, sleep and skincare is the real secret to long-term beauty. And now more than ever, with the pandemic we’re experiencing, and the stress and lifestyle changes that come with it, it’s very important to take a holistic approach seriously in order to achieve lasting results. What makes Susanne Kaufmann cosmetics different? Susanne Kaufmann - My brand philosophy is to support the natural functions of the skin so that it can function at its best and bring out its vitality. Our approach is holistic: we look at the whole picture and see skincare as a means of prevention so that we can address the specific needs of the skin with our tailored products and treatments. It’s not just about our products, it’s about balance: healthy eating, exercise and adequate sleep are among the most important elements. Our commitment to sustainability is also unique and is reflected in every element of our production process. Whether it’s the solar and thermal energy used to power our production facilities, responsible sourcing of botanicals for our formulas or our innovative refillable packaging. The use of renewable resources, cutting-edge science and intelligent product design have been integral to our production methods for nearly two decades. Can you tell us about your latest innovations in sustainable beauty? Susanne Kaufmann - We launched a refill pilot program for three of our best-selling products in February 2021. Our brand is the first in the world to use The Simple One, a new lightweight plastic refill bottle developed by ALPLA. Based in Vorarlberg, Austria, near our own production site and headquarters in Bezau, ALPLA is a leader in the development and manufacturing of sustainable plastic packaging solutions. The new 250 ml refills are currently available for three of our best-selling products: Cleansing Gel, Hand Soap and Shower/Shampoo. Will this help reduce the environmental impact? Susanne Kaufmann - Although relatively clean to produce, glass bottles are notoriously heavy to transport. Our new refill bottle is up to 60% lighter than standard HDPE bottles and reduces CO2 emissions during production, transportation and the post-consumer recycling process. Not only does the new lightweight refill significantly reduce the carbon footprint, it also extends the life of the glass bottle well beyond its original single-use design. Each recyclable refill, with its smart cap-less design, not only helps reduce landfill waste, but also reduces carbon emissions by 69%. Our secondary packaging is also made from 100% recyclable paper. How will this change consumers’ beauty routines? Susanne Kaufmann - People have a direct link these days to their favorite brands and can find out exactly what is important to them. Living fairly and sustainably means being aware of the consequences of your lifestyle and consumption habits and acting responsibly. Everyone can contribute to making the world a fairer and more sustainable place. Natural resources — such as clean water and air — are finite and must be protected to preserve present and future life on our planet. Is it necessary for cosmetics brands to be sustainable to get the attention of consumers these days? Susanne Kaufmann - It’s essential for us; it’s part of the DNA of the Susanne Kaufmann brand. What are these new standards that you are going to put in place? Susanne Kaufmann - Our Refill program is a first step. We believe that sustainability is a never-ending journey, and we are committed to continuing to explore opportunities to reduce the brand’s environmental impact throughout 2021 and beyond. The brand intends to expand the scope of the refill program with the addition of more products for the second half of 2021. Another sustainability first is the state-of-the-art solar-powered bulk mixer used in the manufacturing facility we share with our longtime production partner, Ingo Metzler. Located in Egg, Austria, just 15 minutes from our headquarters in Bezau, it features a custom-designed, high-capacity (300 kilograms) solar-powered mixing unit that is currently in use around the world. How can these innovations have an impact on the industry as a whole? Susanne Kaufmann - The key to making a difference is education. Brands and consumers alike have a responsibility to use sustainable resources and consume consciously, especially as our impact on the planet becomes increasingly evident. Brands can support this by sharing their knowledge of the new sustainable methods they are implementing. It’s a path that will continue to evolve, but if everyone starts thinking sustainably, we can make a big difference. We can easily get lost navigating through the cosmetics landscape between organic, natural and ecologically responsible. What constitutes skincare that respects both the skin and the planet in the present? Susanne Kaufmann - From an early age, I learned to be environmentally conscious and to integrate the idea of sustainability into my daily life. The Bregenzerwald is our greatest asset: wherever I am in the region, I feel its energy, shaped by traditions combined with a unique agricultural culture based on sustainability, modern innovation and solidarity. Terms like ’clean’ and ’natural’ go far beyond high-quality, natural and effective ingredients. They must also encompass environmentally friendly production, sustainable innovation in packaging, manufacturing processes and a deep respect for nature and people. This has always been our philosophy. It has always been a question of a global vision. It is therefore very important that in everything we do, our philosophy guides our approach. We aim to always maintain the quality and effectiveness of our products, to target the different needs of the skin, to produce in a sustainable way and to stay true to our roots and brand values wherever we are in the world. How can well-being affect external beauty? Susanne Kaufmann - In Austria, we have a holistic view of beauty. This means that if you stay healthy, you look and feel better. At Susanne Kaufmann, we always recommend a holistic lifestyle. Everything is connected: our environment, our mental health and our physical being. It’s no secret that the right combination of exercise, a balanced diet, sleep and a personalized skincare regimen can provide significant wellness benefits. These benefits are in turn reflected in our skin, in the form of a radiant, glowing complexion."
Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna to be held from 10 to 14 March 2022,"The reference event for the global cosmetics industry will be back in its traditional format from 10 to 14 March 2022: the Cosmopack pavilion, hosting members of the supply chain, and the Cosmo | Perfumery and Cosmetics pavilion, hosting the retail and perfumery sectors, will be inaugurated from Thursday to Sunday, while Cosmo | Hair, Nail and Beauty Salon will welcome professional operators from Friday to Monday. ""In 2019, Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna hosted over 250,000 operators from 154 countries, of which 47% foreign, and more than 3,000 companies from 70 countries, 70% of which from abroad. Such an international event needs an essential balance of factors. In Bologna, new collections are launched, and collaborations are outlined on a global scale. To ensure a functional edition in line with market expectations, it is necessary to reschedule Cosmoprof for March 2022,"" explained Enrico Zannini, General Manager of BolognaFiere Cosmoprof. To facilitate business activities during the first half of the year, when physical appointments are unlikely to not be allowed yet in Europe, the organizers will hold WeCosmoprof International, a fully digital event scheduled from 7 to 18 June 2021. For the first time, companies and visitors to all the trade fairs of the Cosmoprof network [1] will be able to interact with each other and share new programs for the future. Furthermore, to facilitate the restart of the beauty industry, the organizers announced that a new event in an “unprecedented format” will be held from 9 to 13 September 2021. Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna “will be back in attendance on the expected dates of March, which are traditionally more functional for the needs of the cosmetics industry. However, the need to resume activities is tangible among the players in the sector. Therefore, a new event will be exceptionally organized with an unprecedented format, which will bring stakeholders to Bologna from 9 to 13 September for a first relaunch,"" said declares Gianpiero Calzolari, President of BolognaFiere. “In September, we will organize an event that will attract operators and companies for a first but fundamental relaunch of activities,” added Enrico Zannini.

L’Occitane chooses Tubex post-consumer recycled aluminium tubes,"Tubex Aluminium Tubes is a subsidiary of Austrian-German industrial group CAG, which owns Stölzle Glass Group, among others. They have been specialized for 70 years in the development and manufacturing of aluminium tubes for the cosmetics, food, and pharmaceutical industries. “We adopted an ecoresponsible approach in 2018. The aluminium tube industry has not changed much over the past few years: we wanted to offer a breakthrough innovation,” says Thierry Bitout, CEO of Tubex. After launching the Blue Tube in 2018, a tube fully made of recycled aluminium derived from industrial waste, the company developed Blue Tube Evo, which contains 95% of post-consumer waste (PCR for Post-Consumer Recycled) and 5% of PIR (Post-Industrial Recycled). “We wanted to do even better by producing tubes based on tubes. Blue Tube Evo is 95% derived from used aluminium tubes, cans and aerosols thrown by consumers. The notion of circularity is essential. We have designed our alloy so that we could source very diverse types of waste and be supplied high quantities in unlimited access,” adds Thierry Bitout. The 5% derived from industrial waste help adjust the chemical and mechanic composition of the whole product to obtain a unique alloy, while preserving both aesthetics and the properties of standard aluminium tubes, and ensuring endless recyclability. In order to keep improving the environmental profile of their products and strategy based on three key parameters – Reduce, Recycle, and React – the brand now aims to get rid of any unnecessary packaging and start using recyclable and/or recycled alternative materials. Although they are already based on a material that can be recycled over and over, all the brand’s iconic aluminium tubes will undergo a full transformation in 2021. “We have already added recycled PET to our bottles, but we did not want to ignore aluminium. We found Tubex’s technology really attractive, because it is based on 95% of post-consumer recycled aluminium. To us, cleaning up what comes out of our bins also matters,” says Corinne Fugier-Garrel, Packaging Concept Development & Innovation Director of L’Occitane en Provence. The Tubex technology reduces CO2 emissions and the carbon footprint by 70% and 60%, respectively, compared to a standard aluminium tube on the market. “That’s exactly what our customers want: a product that is both circular and has a low environmental footprint. L’Occitane has always addressed these issues, so it was the ideal solution,” adds Thierry Bitout. All 22 references concerned, in particular the 75-ml and 150-ml hand creams, will be made with the Blue Tube Evo solution by the end of 2021. As a result of the conclusive pilot study conducted in 2019 to test shower gel filling in stores, this year, L’Occitane aims to offer this service in about 60 points of sale across the world. “Thanks to the pilot tests, we learnt a lot from our customers and beauty advisors. Consumers are favourable to this type of re-purchase, but they want a complete routine,” explains Corinne Fugier-Garrel. As a result, the fountains will offer a routine comprising hand liquid, shower gel, shower oil, shampoo, and conditioners. Two 250-ml and 500-ml bottles made of recycled aluminium will be available for sale, and then filled in and labelled by beauty advisors. Refills help save about 15%, and the aesthetic bottle goes with a leaflet with cleaning and maintenance instructions for successive refills. Tubex launches first 100% aluminium-based tube As for the manufacturer, this spring, they will launch a new innovation: the Monotube. Thanks to this unique, 100% aluminium-based version, they got rid of the tube’s plastic cap. It is actually fitted with a cannula which can be separated from the tube: the latter can then be closed by turning the cannula upside down. “Our Monotube is made of a single recycled material. It is compliant with today’s environmental requirements as regards packaging, because it reduces emissions and guarantees a high level of recyclability and circularity,” says Thierry Bitout."
Emmanuel Guichard appointed General Delegate of FEBEA,"Forty-four-year-old agronomist Emmanuel Guichard started his career as a researcher in the United States and Spain. He then joined the world of professional associations in France and in Brussels. He was first in charge of economic affairs at the French union of beetroot producers (CGB), before working as the secretary general of the European confederation of yeast producers (COFALEC), in Brussels. Since 2016, Emmanuel Guichard had been the General Delegate of Elipso. This industry being in a transitional period, he became an expert in circular economy, from design to packaging recycling, so he boasts a good understanding of consumer goods and a leading expertise in circular economy and the European machinery. “I’m extremely happy to join the cosmetics manufacturing sector, a flagship industry which contributes to France’s influence on the global level. This strong industry’s excellence and performance are driven by both major groups and SMEs across the whole territory. Now, in this historic period marked by the COVID crisis, but also by deep changes as regards consumer habits, we need, more than ever, to take action as a group, so that, day after day, we better meet consumer expectations and stay in line with our society’s changes. I warmly thank Patrick O’Quin for the outstanding work he did as the head of FEBEA, as he contributed to making it a leading federation and a reference partner for public authorities and our whole ecosystem,” explains Emmanuel Guichard. Patrick O’Quin, who has decided to retire, will leave his office after a one-month transitional period. “Thanks to the support and engagement of our members, we can be collectively proud of the work done by FEBEA for the cosmetics industry, throughout the years. It was a pleasure and honour to work with beauty companies, which embody excellence and innovation in France and around the world. I’m delighted to welcome Emmanuel Guichard, who will offer his experience with professional associations, his expertise in circular economy, and his deep knowledge of economic, social, and environmental issues. This will be particularly valuable for our federation and industry in the years to come”."
The Body Shop deploys refill stations globally,"As soon as April 2021, 47 stores in France will offer refill stations for a selection of shower gels, liquid hand soap, shampoos, and conditioners. On the global level, 400 stations should be installed by the end of the year, so that all stores can be equipped within the next five years. In France, 47 stores are part of the plan – the better part of the network. The selection will vary from at least six references to a maximum of 12, depending on the store size. In practice, a 300-ml recyclable aluminium-based bottle will be available for EUR 2.50 to go with the refill dose chosen, which will cost EUR 7 – less than the packed version. The aluminium bottle will then be refilled over and over in a store. Customers are responsible for cleaning the containers. In stores, beauty advisors will stick the labels on the bottles to indicate the expiry dates and batch numbers. “With this project, The Body Shop sticks to its activist heritage, that of Anita Roddick, its founder. We are proud to be the first cosmetics brand to deploy this solution so broadly, both in terms of number of stores and references. Since we are B-Corp-certified, we feel responsible for the packs we market. All our products are recyclable and contain plastic derived from fair trade,” explains Hugues Laurençon. Indeed, in 2019, the brand set up an exclusive partnership with a startup based in India to support plastic waste collectors working in the streets, most of whom are ostracised. This partnership provides them with fair, stable revenues, while preventing waste from proliferating in nature. The recycled plastic from this chain is now contained in different proportions in all The Body Shop products. In addition to refill stations, a new store concept called Activist Maker Workshop was created to use second-hand furniture. “Everything has already had a first life, we actually do industrial recycling. It is a whole, a store redesigned with new products,” says Hugues Laurençon. The first store opened in London’s Oxford Street in 2019. In France, it will start with the city of Dijon in June, and then Carré Sénart in September. As for products, the iconic “body butters” that made the brand successful were reviewed to obtain formulas with 95% to 99% of ingredients of natural origin for 96 hours of hydration. And the hardly recyclable black plastic lid was replaced with a new aluminium lid. As for perfumes, the classic White Musk designed in 1981 will now be available in a new bottle based on 42% of recycled glass and fitted with a removable pump, without any overpackaging. The Body Shop is also willing to contribute to making beauty rhyme with inclusiveness. A global study conducted by Ipsos revealed women’s lack of self-love in several countries, especially France: French women are ranked last according to this Self-Love Index, together with Saudi Arabians. As a solution, the brand launched the #SelfLoveUprising movement in partnership with different celebs, including singer Lous and the Yakuza in France and Belgium, and Jameela Jamil, an actress and Body Positive activist, in the UK. They are the spokeswomen of a campaign launched on March 16 on the social media and in stores. “Lous and the Yakuza embodies self-love. She supports us with this campaign to pass on the message that to love others, you need to start with yourself. We suggested she choose an association for which we will organize a fundraising campaign,” explains the General Manager. Now that the brand is part of the Natura & Co group, they have spoken up again, willing to broaden their presence through physical stores in France and around the world. “It is crucial to have a human connection, and it is not because the situation is not favourable that we will let down retail. We want to share our values; that is why we need human contact. We believe in the power of relationships,” says Hugues Laurençon. Asia is a new territory to conquer, he explains. “Our brand deliberately avoided China until now, despite its dynamism, because we did not support animal testing. But soon, we will be able to enter this market, thanks to the recent government decisions to ban animal cruelty.” As far as France is concerned, the store fleet will need to be optimized with openings or relocations. As regards their joining the Natura & Co group, Hugues Laurençon is delighted about the union of brands with common values and the will to give The Body Shop its roughness back. “The idea is to give the brand its voice back. It is not a cosmetic brand like others. It is a committed brand. Selling products is the means, the message is the end,” he concludes."
Arcade Beauty strengthens its full-service offer and expands its CSR approach,"With a drop in demand for samples in some categories such as make-up and perfume, and on the other hand, a huge success for doypacks, especially for refill and home hair care solutions, the year 2020 was a mixed bag for Arcade Beauty, as it was for many beauty packaging manufacturers. ""While the pandemic had a significant impact on our sampling activity, our sales activity, launched five years ago, continued to grow in 2020, thanks in particular to the dynamism of mass retailing,"" underlines Carl Allain, Senior Vice-President, Head of Europe, General Manager, at Arcade Beauty. Beyond the economic situation, where demand for skincare samples is taking off again strongly, driven by Asian and especially Chinese demand, the market is changing profoundly. ""Behaviours are changing too: in-store testing is no longer done in the same way, self-service testers are under threat. We are working hand in hand with POS manufacturers to create touch-free solutions. And we are also addressing the boom in e-commerce and home delivery, with 3D solutions that are easy to fit into parcels and suiting this mode of consumption,"" continues Carl Allain. To carry out this transformation, the group relies in particular on its digital platform Abeo, which supports brands in their e-sampling campaigns, by managing the entire supply chain, from the request for a sample via social networks to its final delivery at home. But Arcade Beauty is also adapting its business model by reinforcing its ready-to-sell retail offer in Europe and North America, in line with the global demand for turnkey solutions allowing to accelerate the time to market of products in line with rapidly changing expectations. ""We are complementing our offer by adding an extra brick to the value chain, thanks to ready-to-use formulas produced with an international network of partners in Asia (Korea and China), but also in France,"" explains Candice Jagut, Global Business Development Retail Market Director at Arcade Beauty. The group already offers a range of ready-to-sell products, including skincare masks packaged in Poland with vegan formulas made in France with 96% ingredients of natural origin, on a 100% biodegradable cotton base. And to meet sustainability expectations, the secondary pack can consist either of single plastic material or of more than 50% paper (making it recyclable in the paper sector). The group also has a range of biocidal hydro-alcoholic gels with a neutral formula that can be perfumed according to the customer’s wishes. ""We aim to develop our lines of ready-to-sell skincare products with innovative solutions, in terms of dosage forms and packaging, as well as temporary promotions meeting the various needs of historic or independent brands, but also of retailers looking for private label solutions,"" continues Candice Jagut. Hence, Arcade is responding to the evolution of dosage forms, in particular, the rise of waterless formulations, with the creation in Poland of a workshop dedicated to the conditioning of powders. With increasingly trendy products that fit perfectly with the various types of flexible packaging solutions proposed by the group. And also with flexible packagings which are in line with the demand for weight reduction and recyclability, a domain in which Arcade has multiplied innovations, particularly in terms of sustainability, and decoration options. Finally, on the CSR side, the policy rolled out in Europe since 2019 has been extended to the group’s activities in the United States. The aim is to disseminate eco-design practices that are already widespread in the company by integrating CSR criteria into each new project, evaluated with the same life cycle assessment tool in Europe and North America (even if the reference databases necessarily vary). ""For each technology, we review the possible evolutions, to offer an optimised product, around the four key criteria of material reduction, namely, recycling, the use of renewable materials and the reuse or refill possibilities,"" explains Claudie Guérin, CSR Director at Arcade Beauty. This approach also includes the ethical selection of suppliers at every stage of the value chain (which has led, for example, to the generalisation of the purchase of certified paper), the reduction of the impact of operations, with quantified objectives including the certification of sites for the main indicators, and the awareness-raising of all employees. In the end, a company in full transformation, closely aligned with the evolution of its customer markets."
Amorepacific’s HERA to launch its signature Rouge Holic Line on Amazon US,"The ""new classic"" Rouge Holic line features dense, rich colors with a texture that glides across the lips to add a beautiful glow and accentuate the lips’ natural volume.

To promote the advanced collection, the South Korean beauty conglomerate has selected K-Pop celebrity Jennie. “Jennie was selected as HERA’s ambassador since 2019. As a member of K-pop girl band BLACKPINK, Jennie is the right model for HERA not just because her charming appearance but her passion and confidence to be herself fit HERA ’s brand philosophy, which is ’finding and expressing the confident and strong self and unique individual beauty that exists deep within oneself’,” says the group in statement."
Major beauty brands are now placing bet in Australia,"As Australia is becoming the new Hollywood with great weather, beautiful beaches and few Covid cases comparatively to the rest of the world, major beauty brands are now placing bet in Australia. South Korea’s beauty brand LANEIGE just launched this week into Adore Beauty in Australia and New Zealand. The Amorepacific brand launched into Australia and New Zealand in 2018 and since then the LANEIGE Lip Sleeping Mask has become the first Lip Care Product and Water Sleeping Mask the first Mask in the market. LANEIGE is launching on Adore Beauty with thirty of its best-selling skincare products. This will include LANEIGE’s most loved ranges; Sleeping Care (including Lip Sleeping Masks), Water Bank, Cream Skin, Basic Care (Cleansers & Toners) and Sets. Adore Beauty is a leading beauty e-commerce platform across the Australian and New Zealand market. “LANEIGE has become a much coveted beauty brand in Australia and New Zealand since its launch and to be able to share this incredible brand with the highly engaged Adore Beauty community is another significant step for us. We admire and applaud Adore Beauty’s deepening reach and appeal with the ANZ beauty customer, and we look forward to our bright future together,” says Caroline Dunlop, Amore Pacific President, ANZ. At the end of the month, March 30 to be exact, Milk Makeup will land in Australia. They just announced the brand will now stocked online at Sephora Australia and New Zealand. Milk Makeup was born at Milk Studios, a fashion photography studio in downtown NYC. The brand was initially started for Milk’s creative community who didn’t see themselves represented in the beauty world and creating products that reimagine beauty, not you. Claiming to be all about good ingredients and epic payoff, Milk Makeup has grown as the epitome of the clean beauty trend. The range is cruelty-free, paraben-free, and 100% vegan. The launch sees a selection of the brand’s best-selling products available, including Hydro Grip Primer, KUSH High Volume Mascara and Lip + Cheek in Werk."
Brazil’s cosmetics industry accelerates its international development,"Brazil Beauty News - Created over 20 years ago, the Beautycare Brazil project supports Brazilian companies to develop their business on foreign markets. How has the program worked in the current context, without international fairs and events? Gueisa Silvério - Beautycare Brazil aims to promote the growth of exports of Brazilian products and services all along the value chain of the personal hygiene, perfume and cosmetics industry. This work encompasses the selection of key markets and the participation of the companies involved in the project in major international fairs. Due to the pandemic, face-to-face events have been suspended worldwide and Beautycare Brazil had to adapt to the new scenario. We have been focusing on online activities, with content developed with specialists from ABIHPEC and international market research firms. This enabled us to present up-to-date information on consumer behaviors and trends in countries such as South Korea, the United Arab Emirates and the United States. In the first half of 2020, we created a working group with members of the program to review our communication strategy and strengthen the image of the Brazilian industry abroad. For 2021, we seek to carry out actions in partnership with Apex-Brasil international offices, as well as with the trade services within Brazilian embassies and consulates. We have also broadened our initiatives to address other topics that may be of interest to member companies of the sector project. Brazil Beauty News - It’s a paradox, but the Brazilian beauty sector performed well in 2020, with exports rising and a first trade surplus after a decade of deficit. How do you explain it? Gueisa Silverio - We do not see this as a paradox if we consider both the good performance of our industry on its domestic market and the results of the trade balance. Remember that Brazil is the 4th world market for personal hygiene and beauty products and the 3rd country for the number of product launches. We closed 2020 with sales up 5.8% (ex-factory price), compared to the previous year. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, the Brazilian cosmetics industry has shown solidity and agility. Concretely, the sector recorded a positive trade balance of 23.4 million dollars in 2020. The rise of the dollar compared to the Brazilian currency and the reduction in imports linked to the quarantine imposed by the coronavirus led to an estimated reduction in imports of USD 585.9 million for the year, a drop of 16.8% from 2019. However, we must also take into account the increased interest of Brazilians in domestic products, which are always more innovative and of better quality and therefore increasingly able to replace imported goods and gain shares on export markets. Brazilian perfumes, whose sales grew 8.4% in 2020, are a good example. When we look at the performance of the Beautycare Brazil project, we see a 26% growth, notably thanks to ingredient manufacturers, who have won over major customers and gained market share internationally. Brazil Beauty News - What are the main strengths of the Brazilian cosmetics industry on international markets? Gueisa Silvério - Brazilian cosmetics are recognized worldwide for their innovative features in several categories, the use of ingredients from our biodiversity is a real differentiating asset to attract new customers and increase our international competitiveness. It should also be noted that the great diversity of the Brazilian population also stimulates the R&D of our companies and, consequently, the variety of their product offer, in particular for hair care. Brazil Beauty News - Brazilian brands are strong and are developing in Latin America. How is your performance in other parts of the world? Gueisa Silvério - Latin American countries are among the top 15 destinations for Brazilian cosmetic exports, accounting for 79.3% of the total. Argentina leads, followed by Chile and Mexico. It is important to stress that a large part of our exports are made by multinational companies located in Brazil, or by national actors who operate independently, without the support of the project. Things are different among the members of Beautycare Brazil. The project concerns the entire value chain. As a result, Latin America only represents 37% of our exported volumes. In total our members export to 118 countries, with Argentina, the United States, Colombia, Chile, Malaysia and Egypt in the leading pack."
"“Our strength lies in medicine and naturalness,” Éric Ducournau, Pierre Fabre","Premium Beauty News - You launched a major transformation plan in 2019. Could you tell us a bit more? Éric Ducournau - First, we put an emphasis on what has helped the Pierre Fabre Group stand out since it was founded: the association of Medicine and Naturalness. This positioning is based on our complementary specializations in Life Sciences and Nature: cell biology, biotechnologies, botany, and biodiversity. To highlight our positioning, we invested in three priority areas: oncology, dermatology, and dermocosmetics. We are now the only company in the world to offer solutions to prevent skin cancers, treat them, and also treat their side effects. For example, Eau Thermale Avène offers health cures for women who had chemotherapy as well as replenishing skincare products free from any preservatives, thanks to Sterile Cosmetics. Our transformation plan includes another key part: digitalization, which is implemented in all the company’s functions. In 2020, we doubled the share of e-retail in our sales and created a data centre of excellence aimed to support all trades, from R&D to marketing. Premium Beauty News - Why did you sell Galénic to Yatsen and Elancyl to Cantabria? Éric Ducournau - These are two very beautiful, highly innovative brands on their respective markets, but they no longer corresponded to our strategic positioning combining Medicine and Naturalness. Galénic is a high-end face care brand and Elancyl is specialized in slimming products. We wanted to invest in brands that follow dermatologists’ recommendations and mainly target damaged or weakened skins, like Eau Thermale Avène, Ducray, and A-Derma, as well as in botany-oriented brands, such as Klorane and René Furterer. Premium Beauty News - Are there synergies between your medical and dermocosmetics businesses? Éric Ducournau - That is actually why we are so strong on the global beauty market! What other cosmetics company can boast having an R&D centre with researchers in oncology, dermatology, and cosmetology? We have a campus in Toulouse, in the south of France, with over 600 Pierre Fabre employees working near basic research laboratories, biotech companies, and hospital doctors. Extraordinary innovation stories emerge from this closeness between researchers from different backgrounds. For example, this year, Avène will launch a sunscreen with a new UV filter named Triasorb. This filter is derived from molecules discovered and patented by a Pierre Fabre medical research team as part of a programme against migraine. The patent registered by our team mentioned a potential for molecule sun protection, which gave another team the idea to focus on this anti-UV performance and led to the discovery of Triasorb. In 2018, it was added to the very short list of UV filters authorized in Europe. Premium Beauty News - The microbiome is also a key issue for the group. Éric Ducournau - Indeed, we are pioneers in understanding the skin microbiome in atopic dermatitis. Almost half of our clients at the Avène spa resort suffer from it, so it is a sort of research centre unique in the world: our researchers work on the observations made to pursue a major research programme called “skin microbiology and atopic dermatitis”. Their work led to several publications in international journals and our teams developed the first non-invasive method for analyzing the skin microbiome. It helped us set up a collection of microorganisms isolated from both healthy and pathological skins in order to analyze and better understand the skin disorders related to atopic dermatitis, and develop skincare that restores bacterial diversity: Avène’s Xéracalm skincare range is based on an active extracted from bacteria found in the unique microflora of thermal water. Our pharmacological work shows that these bacteria boost the production of antimicrobial peptides which defend the skin against pathogenic bacteria. Premium Beauty News - The Pierre Fabre Group was a trail-blazer with the invention of Sterile Cosmetics, a patented technology which avoids the use of preservatives in skincare products. Is there anything new with this? Éric Ducournau - You are absolutely right to remind that Mr Pierre Fabre was a forerunner when, as early as the 1990s, he imagined the first system to make sterile skincare for pathological or weakened skins. At that time, these products were marketed in the form of single-use single doses. Since then, we have enhanced this technology, which became Sterile Cosmetics in 2009. Thanks to Sterile Cosmetics, we formulate products containing only actives essential for the skin, without any preservatives. They are sterilized during the manufacturing phase with a unique process, packed in sterile areas, and their sterility is guaranteed throughout the use phase. In 2020, we further improved the packing system with a very easy-to-use, fully watertight miniaturized pump. This innovation is featured in the new Tolérance Control face care range for highly sensitive skins developed by Eau Thermale Avène. Premium Beauty News - How do you plan to grow in China? Éric Ducournau - 2020 was marked by the boom of e-retail, which now represents over 60% of our dermocosmetics revenue. This digital acceleration helped our hair care brands René Furterer and Klorane settle more quickly than expected in China, a market they recently entered, alongside Eau Thermale Avène, which is already well-known there. In 2021, we will emphasize Avène’s medical positioning by working closely with our new strategic partner, the Beijing University Hospital – more precisely its national clinical research centre specialized in skin and immune diseases. In addition, we will develop our precision marketing and widen our presence on social media to attract new consumers. In parallel, we have many projects in oncology. We sell oral chemotherapy for treating lung and breast cancer and we are about to launch clinical trials for a new targeted therapy for colorectal cancer, which we have already marketed in Europe. Plus, we will relaunch an innovative treatment for preventing breast cancer recurrence – we have just got exclusive rights from American biotech company PUMA. Beyond China, the whole Asia-Pacific region will benefit from our investments in oncology. Premium Beauty News - What about CSR? What actions have you taken to reduce your environmental impact? Éric Ducournau - Up until 2018, the group’s sustainability and naturalness programmes were followed up by several separate divisions. In 2019, we created a whole entity focused on this issue, the Green Mission Pierre Fabre, which works on our CSR policy as a whole and on natural active sourcing. Our commitments are in line with the Paris Agreement, which is aimed to limit the planet’s temperature increase to 2°C by the end of the century. To contribute to these efforts, we will reduce our CO2 emissions by 30% and use 25% of renewable energy by 2025. What’s more, we use over 400 plant extracts in the group, 80% of which will soon be derived from organic farming. As an example, Klorane has just launched a moisturizing face care range with organic cornflower grown by our agronomists in the Tarn region. The active is extracted with a solvent-free extrusion process using distilled water. The formula contains more than 95% of natural ingredients and the packaging is based on recyclable glass. It perfectly highlights our Conscious Care commitment, which consists in combining formulas free from controversial or unnecessary ingredients, scientific rigor, controlled sourcing chains, eco-design, and green chemistry."
Bogart innovates in perfumes and enhances synergies with retail network,"French based Groupe Bogart, who owns perfume (Jacques Bogart, Carven, and Ted Lapidus) and cosmetics brands (Méthode Jeanne Piaubert, Stendhal, April), holds the Chevignon licence, and has a retailer network of 380 perfume shops across the world, has scheduled several range launches or redesigns this year. Carven, the group’s most dynamic brand since the Dans Ma Bulle perfume was created, will broaden their offering next May with a new men’s fragrances by Aurélien Guichard, perfumer-creator at Takasago, and then next September, this time with a new women’s perfume designed by Juliette Karagueuzoglou and Caroline Dumur, perfumers at IFF. “We have been passionately reviving the Carven perfumes for eight years, and it is a real success. This year, this beautiful brand will become the group’s leader in terms of turnover. Our main value consists in offering total freedom of creation, while really listening to consumers’ desires, thanks to our retailer expertise,” explains Nicolas Dewitte. Jacques Bogart has also prepared an ambitious launch for the Silver Scent line, which keeps making progress globally, in Europe, Latin America, and as far as Australia. At Ted Lapidus, eight new fragrances called Stories by Lapidus were launched last November for a more affordable price: EUR 39 for 100 ml. “One market segment is not much developed in Western Europe: that of intermediate ranges. We will try to position ourselves on this segment with perfumes with an excellent value for money, so that we overturn the codes of traditional perfumery,” says Nicolas Dewitte. If the General Manager revealed he is considering possible new purchases, he also announced a major innovation for this spring: the creation of a new alcohol-free perfume brand. Based on Symrise’s Innoscent technology, Néo Colognes has developed five intense fragrances free from alcohol. These products are made in France, in Bogart Group’s plants. “It is the first time a brand has offered clean, alcohol-free eaux de Cologne with a high percentage of ingredients of natural origin developed with a responsible approach,” says Nicolas Dewitte. These Néo Colognes will first be launched via the group’s distribution network, starting from June, for EUR 79 (100 ml), and then through other channels. “Designed in less than a year, this development was possible because we listened to consumers’ needs, thanks to our distribution network and 1,476 beauty advisors,” emphasizes Nicolas Dewitte. After completely restructuring Méthode Jeanne Piaubert, a year ago, the group is doing the same with premium brand Stendhal. The formulas were reviewed to reach over 90% of ingredients of natural origin and the packaging was made more ecoresponsible, in particular by designing refills and removing both instruction leaflets and bolsters in all products. A new active, Elixir de Lys, developed at the R&D laboratory in the Pyrenees, has also completed the Stendhal range. “It is a natural active with anti-spot properties which evens out the tone and prevents the harmful effects on the skin of blue light, pollution, and the sun – an increasingly concerning issue for women,” explains the Deputy General Manager. In addition, the brand is about to relaunch its makeup line: vegan formulas and feminine, timeless shades in uncluttered packaging. April, the private label of the eponymous network, also keeps growing. A few months after the successful relaunch of the bathroom line, they have sped things up with makeup: almost 500 new references are scheduled for October. “April is designed as a cosmetics and makeup brand to be deployed at other retailers,” explains the General Manager. Lastly, Bogart aims to keep opening April stores in the Middle East. Today, the network counts 380 perfume shops in Israel, France, Germany, and Benelux. “While everyone is closing down physical stores, we still intend to develop our retail network. We believe it is still important to exchange with our customers in physical stores, to smell perfumes, discover new launches, and get familiar with textures,” states Nicolas Dewitte. Next perfume shop will open in May in the heart of Dubai, across 250 m2, and then four other store inaugurations are scheduled for June, also in the United Arab Emirates. The group aims to gradually open about thirty stores in the Middle East. The e-retail part now represents 6% of the group’s turnover. They would like to reach 10% with a new website which will be operational next April in Germany, and then next September, throughout Europe. “E-retail should really be a plus for retail. It should be complementary and provide a new service. We will speed things up with our omnichannel strategy and develop the website accordingly.” The group also made use of the tough year 2020 to implement an information reporting system from store managers to the group’s brand development managers. “The crisis emphasized the need to listen to consumers even more, so that we can offer products better-adapted to their needs. If we are successful with our direct contact system, we will have transformed this difficult year into an opportunity,” concludes Nicolas Dewitte."
CTK launches turnkey product development digital platform,"Based in Seoul, the CTK Cosmetics company founded in 2001 achieves more than three quarters of its turnover outside its country of origin, in particular in the US. Initially specialized in packaging, in 2017, it was transformed to implement a business model focused on the full development of cosmetic products, by relying on an active R&D service and on innovations - both formulas and packaging. Much affected by the global sanitary situation, just like their customers, this year, the group turned to digital technologies to overcome the slowdown and regain agility. Within the company, a sales-force-oriented system was implemented to provide the organization with better accessibility and accuracy as regards data and data management, as well as more visibility as regards the workflow needed for each project. Externally, the group invested in the digital transformation of their business model through CTKClip, a digital development platform reserved for their customers and accessible all around the world. “Our customers can find inspiration and create projects themselves, from A to Z, thanks to our formulation and packaging resources. We aim to improve our global reach to widen our influence in Europe, the Middle East, and China,” says Ian Chung, founder and CEO of the company. CTK has just opened a new innovation laboratory specialized in formulas. The CTK Innolab will help the company meet market sustainability needs with a particularly high quality level to meet the strictest global standards. “In 2020, our development team created 137 new innovative cosmetic products, including some of the world’s best sellers in the face care, concealer, and eyeliner categories, many of them being clean and vegan formulas, in line with the current trends,” adds CTK Cosmetics Vice-President Sunny Choi. As for packaging, the innovations are mainly focused on sustainability, with concepts based on single materials, banking on recyclable or reusable products and using as many recycled (PCR) plastics or bioplastics possible. Over the past 20 years, the group’s packaging division has registered 290 patents, which highlights high design and functionality creativity. The latest developments reflect a will to follow the market’s trends. The new Bottom Up Stick enables to use the whole lipstick formula without any product waste. When the user gets to the end, they just need to turn the stick’s rotating base, exerting a slight pressure to get rid of any resistance and release the rest of the product. The content and mechanism can be separated for better material recyclability. The Eco-Pact is a 100% recyclable compact pack for powders or balms fully based on PET. The aluminium mirror can be easily removed, so the product can be recycled. CTK has also developed Green pumps, a series of containers and airless pumps perfectly adapted to new environmental conditions. The Eco-Green Springless pump is fully recyclable and features no spring, so the full product can be returned. The container is based on 94% PP and 6% PPM. The pumps are available in 15-ml to 100-ml sizes."
Laboté fights cosmetics waste and hacks used packaging,"If there is one field in which products should meet very personal needs, it is cosmetics. Based on this belief and on the fact that beauty’s industrialization often results in waste-generating dissatisfaction, Lucile Battail, PhD in Pharmacy, launched her brand concept Laboté in 2017. In her two Parisian laboratory-points of sale, every product is tailor-made based on a diagnosis made online or in-store. “I wanted to customize the texture and the perfume, taking into account the customer’s environment, weaknesses, intolerances… I needed a lot of flexibility,” she explains. So, she developed a patented cold-emulsion process to make products in five minutes as soon as they have been ordered. The formulas are based on the active value of medicinal plants. Made by a team of chemists, they are fresh and free from any listed preservatives. To Lucile Battail, this highly customized approach is an answer to overconsumption. “Waste is very little dealt with in the cosmetics industry,” she says. According to a study conducted by IFOP, 46% of French women say they do not finish their skincare products. This waste is believed to represent a volume of about 4 tonnes a day in France. To raise awareness of this issue, last February 18, Laboté launched the operation called The Beauty Hack. “I needed an original idea to pass on this new message. Cosmetics waste is an issue few people are aware of,” explains Lucile Battail. In the laboratory located Rue Keller, in Paris, customers can bring back their old glass jars, so they are disinfected and repacked with a formula freshly prepared on-site, and of course, personalized. Online, once their diagnosis has been made, customers can choose to purchase an ecorefill based on a material derived from apple peeling upcycling. The refill goes with a label bearing the batch number and the list of ingredients, as well as with instructions to clean up used jars, so they can be reused. In addition, Laboté offers to retrieve the plastic packs that cannot be sterilized to have them recycled by their partner, Terracycle. An informative video released on February 18 on the social media got a significant number of shares and views: over 100,000 views in a week. “We are definitely legitimate in addressing this issue, and given how successful the operation is, we will do this regularly,” explains the founder. As Laboté’s turnover has almost reached a million euros, they aim to go further with this concept. “I do believe an on-demand production model can be industrialized, and that is what we aim to do. Within the next two years, we will open a much larger, fully automated laboratory where products will still be made on request,” promises the founder."
Nippon Shikizai is banking on the natural innovations of its European subsidiaries,"Heavily affected by the COVID crisis and lockdown measures, large Japanese cosmetic brands have seen their profits drop sharply, according to Tsuyoshi Hasuo, President of Nippon Shikizai France. The group reacted to this situation with adaptability and innovation, in particular with a whole range of make-up and skincare products suited to new consumer expectations. In Europe, Thépenier Pharma & Cosmetics has developed products suiting both the repeated use of digital devices and their impact on the skin, such as a Self-Protective Mist and an Anti-Blue Light Eye Contour. For enhanced antibacterial protection, the laboratory has also developed a biocidal hand gel, both a disinfectant and a moisturiser, formulated with calendula and hyaluronic acid. Nippon Shikizai intends to leverage on its European teams to establish its global development, increase its expertise and reduce time to market. Since the acquisition of Thépenier Pharma & Cosmetics in 2000, more than EUR 13 million have been invested in the production site based in Normandy. With the more recent integration of Orléans Cosmetics, renamed Nippon Shikizai France, the group has stepped up its production capacity to 95 million units per year in Europe. Thépenier Pharma & Cosmetics is one of the fastest-growing manufacturers in Europe with a steady increase in sales. The turnover grew from EUR 9 million in 2014 to EUR 18 million in 2018 and EUR 20 million in 2019 (EUR 23 million with Nippon Shikizai France). Despite the overall context, growth remained strong in 2020 (+9%). Thépenier Pharma & Cosmetics also generates 50% of its revenues on the American market. Alongside Japanese technical know-how, the group centres its French innovation on the trend of natural performance. ""Europe is the cradle of clean, natural and organic beauty for the group,"" assures Bertrand Lasserre, Managing Director of Thépenier Pharma & Cosmetics. A challenge that translates into various clean and hybrid innovations, both in skincare and make-up. Boasting clean, natural, water-free, preservative-free, non-gender and vegan performances, a new range of innovative and high-performance moisturising skincare products is proposed in the form of sticks and with a recyclable packaging solution. It is formulated with 99% natural ingredients (hemp oil, baobab, cellulose, organic mango butter, etc.) and Cosmos certified. Also in skincare, the range of boosters, with well-being, anti-ageing, hydration and skin radiance properties, with more than 97% of ingredients of natural origin, is formulated to suit all skin types. On the side of make-up, the silicone-free line of foundations, concealers and highlighters, plays the card of solid formats with its stick format and claims 97% naturalness and a hybrid action. The mattifying powders, blushes or bronzers, are 100% natural and tinted with vegetable pigments extracted from radish, beetroot and turmeric. The Ultra-Green range of compact powders, blushes and eye shadows has ruled out talcum powder or titanium dioxide, leaving room for 99.9% naturally derived ingredients. Besides the foundation category, which represents the bulk of products manufactured by the group (31%), the mascara/eyeliner range is developing significantly in the Normandy production unit, which offer a brand new natural and hybrid mascara formula featuring active ingredients that strengthen and help the growth of eyelashes. The other main categories are eye-shadow/blush type products (10%), and skin and sun care (10% in 2019) but growing strongly in 2020 thanks to the innovation efforts of Thépenier Pharma & Cosmetics. As for Nippon Shikizai France mainly dedicated to powders which account for 70% of the production, the objective for the coming years is to reach a 50/50 distribution between powders and cast products."
"Cécile Lochard, Guerlain: an “uncompromising” transition towards naturalness ","Premium Beauty News - How did you deal with this transformation towards more natural makeup? Cécile Lochard - We worked hard to apply to makeup what we had managed to do with skincare. Makeup lagged behind for several reasons, the most obvious being that replacing certain ingredients too hastily prevented us from preserving the sensoriality typical of Maison Guerlain. But we had anticipated: for example, it took us over five years to find the right waxes for KissKiss Shine Bloom. It is definitely the trickiest category when it comes to ingredient substitution, but the cosmetics industry has made great progress. Now, we aim to apply this process to all our innovations, in both skincare and makeup. This speeding up consists in developing ever-more high-performing and natural products without compromising on sensoriality, safety, and health. Premium Beauty News - It is a very technical segment. Does the high performance expected make the challenge even more complex? Cécile Lochard - We do not want to talk our customers into accepting the fact that their Terracotta is no longer the same on the grounds that we pushed naturalness as far as possible. At Guerlain, we need performance and sensoriality to meet expectations, including with these new formulas. That is why the search for ingredients involves many steps: we need to obtain properties equivalent to our synthetic materials’. We have worked hard with our partners and historical suppliers. Guerlain had never invested so much in innovation in “natural beauty”. That is how we managed to make these three iconic launches. Besides, Candice Colin, the founder of the Clean Beauty application, integrated our External Ethics Committee as soon as she created the app, three years ago. She challenges our ecoformulation approach as a whole and supports us with this launch. Premium Beauty News - What about ecopackaging? Cécile Lochard - We work on the packaging and the formula eco-design at the same time. But we do sometimes make progress step by step. Again, for Terracotta, the formula goes far beyond the 90% of ingredients of natural origin we had aimed for, since we obtained 96%. But we were not ready to develop a new case: we need to take the time to make analyses and find out what will be most environmentally “profitable”. As far as makeup is concerned, the ecopack parameters vary. For Guerlain, it makes more sense to choose refillable solutions for heavy products, like our ultra-premium ranges, and to favour new materials for lighter creations. Although we are not done yet with eco-design for these three product possibilities, we did not want to put a halt to the advances achieved with the formulas. Still, it should be said that at Guerlain, every new pack corresponds to an environmental performance index and should obtain a higher mark than the previous pack. So, there are changes in terms of materials and weight, only they are not always visible. Premium Beauty News - Could you tell us about the achievements obtained with the Bee Respect platform intended to provide transparent information about the composition of Guerlain products? Cécile Lochard - Bee Respect was launched in January 2019. First, we presented our skincare products, then our makeup products, and then gradually, our perfume catalogue. At the end of 2021, 100% of our products will be traceable. We launched it in France first, but we will have more precise and relevant feedback when the platform is launched on the Chinese market in late 2021. However, we were pleasantly surprised with our customers’ curiosity. Traffic is increasing. The site is very well-perceived by the people who know about it. Guerlain was a pioneer in this field: we anticipated the huge transparency expectations in the luxury segment. Obviously, the sanitary crisis strengthened the demand for more transparent, traceable, and natural products. It was a catalyst, although Maison Guerlain had been long committed. Premium Beauty News - What are your projects as Maison Guerlain’s new Chief Sustainability Officer? Cécile Lochard - We need to go even further. Our new President, Véronique Courtois, aims to go even faster with ecoformulation and ecopackaging. Sustainable development is taken into account on a daily basis in our innovation processes. She really wants to embrace this issue. And she is also committed to speeding up awareness of bees’ preservation, since the bee is the emblem of Maison Guerlain and of biodiversity. We are going to work on education about our totem and explain why it is vital to preserve biodiversity. I think Guerlain is unique in that it has drawn inspiration from Nature for almost 200 years. To us, it is important to work on this relationship through sustainable, natural ingredient sourcing and local audits on honey, orchids, royal jelly, but also neroli, ylang, roses, etc. We audit both the environmental and social aspects for continuous improvement. It may not be the most appealing criterion for consumers, but to me, luxury does not exist without biodiversity. It is a very upstream, sourcing-oriented strategy which makes our products qualitative. Of course, we can share beautiful stories, but above all, we need tangible evidence."
L’Oréal aims 95% sustainable ingredients in its products by 2030,"L’Oréal wants to open a new chapter in Research & Innovation by gradually terminating the use of petroleum derivatives in its formulas over the next few years. In order to address today’s environmental challenges and meet the demand - heightened by the Covid-19 pandemic - for products that are both good for health and safe for the environment, the group has set itself the goal that by 2030, 95% of its ingredients be derived from renewable plant sources, abundant minerals, or circular processes; and 100% of formulas be respectful of the aquatic environment. Why not aiming 100% sustainable ingredients? According to L’Oréal, for certain categories, in particular haircare products, it is not yet technically possible to replace all oil-derived ingredients without lowering their performance. L’Oréal intends to achieve these results by drawing on recent advances in Green Sciences, especially for the sustainably farming of ingredients and the extraction of actives through cutting-edge technological processes. The group is rallying its full range of resources in Green Sciences, including advances in agronomics, together with new developments in biotechnology, Green Chemistry, formulation science and modelling tools. “Our ambition is that by 2030 we will be able to offer women and men around the world increasingly effective, safe cosmetics that respect the environment,” said Nicolas Hieronimus, L’Oréal Deputy Chief Executive Officer, in charge of Divisions. Much remains to be done in this area. According to the group, 80% of its raw materials are ""easily biodegradable"", and 59% are renewable, however only 34% are natural or of natural origin. Furthermore, 29% of the ingredients used in L’Oréal formulas were developed according to the principles of Green Chemistry. To achieve this transition, the group is therefore also building a range of strategic partnerships with universities, start-ups, and its own raw material suppliers. At the same time, L’Oréal remains committed to transparency with new initiatives to further improve information on cosmetic ingredients, specifically through the Inside Our Products website that covers nearly 1,000 listed ingredients and is now available across 45 countries in eight languages. The group also launched, in conjunction with Garnier, an information campaign highlighting the environmental and social impact of its products. The initiative is being deployed around the globe and will gradually encompass all its brands. And to make it all more tangible, L’Oréal will organize a drive on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and YouTube in some 20 countries."
Edgewell speeds up brands green transition,"Edgewell’s strategic goal is crystal clear for the next five years: adopt the cleanest possible industrial and product approach. The group changed its organization accordingly, by appointing a Global Sustainability Director. This strategy immediately drove changes related to both pack and formula design and production processes. British brand Bulldog put forward sustainable ambitions right from the beginning, with formulas composed of 95% of natural ingredients and biosourced plastic tubes. Last year, they launched the first razor fitted with a bamboo handle in a plastic-free pack. This year, they are pushing limits further with a razor whose handle is 70% glass-based: the glass is derived from recycled beer bottles and the razor is also delivered in a plastic-free bag. “It is definitely our iconic brand in terms of ecoresponsibility. Edgewell can use its know-how to structure its historic brands following the same logic,” says Céline Solladié, Head of Marketing Edgewell France. Two major changes were achieved for the Wilkinson’s refillable and disposable ranges. The Hydro razor range has gotten rid of plastic, which was replaced with FSC-certified cardboard. The tray is also made of plant-based fibre, and the foil is cellulose-based – the whole is recyclable. The Hydro 3 and 5 versions have been enriched with a moisturizing gel free from titanium dioxide. As for disposable razors, last September, Wilkinson launched their very first ecodesigned disposable razor, Xtreme 3 Eco Green: the handle is made with 95% recycled plastic and the packaging contains over 95% of recycled and recyclable cardboard. “We are now going to make a substantial change to the rest of the Xtreme 3 range, which accounts for a quarter of the disposable razor market. We have designed a handle composed of at least 70% of recycled plastic. This change will be gradually implemented in all our disposable ranges. We aim to reduce the part of virgin plastic in all our products to less than 50% in four years. We are ahead of schedule with disposable razors,” reveals the Director. The brand specialized in sun products with addictive fragrances reviewed its formulas to completely remove the octocrylene and octinoxate chemical filters from its lotions. Meanwhile, they launched an SPF 30 lotion on the European market: Reef-friendly-labelled, it contains 100% of mineral filters and no controversial ingredients. The bottle is also composed of 25% of recycled plastic. “It is a very strong launch for Hawaiian Tropic. All other products will be reformulated over the next three to five years,” claims Céline Solliadé. On the global razor market affected by a structural decline worsened by the lockdown, Edgewell remains stable and hopes to gain new market shares thanks to these innovations. “Above all, we aim to go much further with Bulldog. In France, this brand has ranked third for three years among men’s brands in supermarkets. Taking into account all skincare products, we have gained 7 points in terms of market shares: we are behind major leaders like L’Oréal and Nivea. It means Bulldog is credible on this market,” adds Céline Solladié."
"Ajnalogie, when perfumes meet aromachology","Premium Beauty News - Where does Ajnalogie’s concept come from? Agathe Jacquinet - Back when I was at the ISIPCA school as an international marketing Master’s student, I worked as a trainee for Phyto, a brand which develops plant-based hair care products. It was a fulfilling, deeply inspiring experience about the power of plants. The discovery of aromachology led to both a revelation and a statement of fact: the benefits of plants in perfumes are very little – almost never – highlighted. That is why I felt like creating a brand which would blend the magic of perfumes and the richness of raw materials. I had the idea of a perfume range with real virtues in terms of wellness and emotions. I also banked on a 100% natural range, though I do not think aromachology is only related to naturalness: anyone can feel emotions with chemical molecules. My choice of 100% natural formulas is not meant to run down synthetic substances, but to provide perfumes with both depth and energy. Premium Beauty News - Could you describe your creative process? Agathe Jacquinet - Once the concept was clear in my head, I started to look for a perfumer. I met Éléonore de Staël, a young perfumer specialized in 100% natural formulas. Then, we were lucky enough to meet experts in this field by hosting thematic workshops. Annick Le Guérer enlightened us about the cultural and historical aspect of aromachology. Sabine Le Camus, professor at ISIPCA, explained to us the virtues of certain accords, and thanks to chemist Francine Joly, we studied the influence of materials and perfumes on our emotions. After a creative phase which lasted a bit more than a year, we had our concentrates produced, and then packed in Grasse, in southern France. As for materials, Éléonore likes working with IFF and LMR. Premium Beauty News - What about the isolates derived from natural materials, but which are classified as synthetic notes? Agathe Jacquinet - Right from the beginning, Éléonore wanted to use them, because she is used to formulating perfumes this way. And these molecules actually offer a broader palette for perfumers to structure and facet their fragrances. Premium Beauty News - What do you think makes your brand original? Agathe Jacquinet - Our concept targets customers in search of connection. Beyond selling perfumes, I am very keen to provide wellness and advice to help people develop and accept themselves. For example, I host olfactory meditation sessions. This concept is also original in that we chose to offer “open” formulas. Lastly, the main raw materials are indicated on the packaging to present their benefits. Premium Beauty News - Is Ajnalogie intended to revolutionize the niche perfumery landscape? Agathe Jacquinet - Ajnalogie’s added value lies in how it diffuses a vision of wellness in the perfume world. For example, beyond perfumes, I created a personality test to determine people’s emotional profiles and needs, and guide them into creating their own daily perfume ritual. Above all, I want to help them adapt their perfumes to their moods. To this aim, I designed a “ritual” box (€75) composed of five 5 ml flasks, so they can have them all. This box makes it possible to fully experience the brand’s concept. That is also why I chose small sizes: I wanted to offer the possibility to have several perfumes for an affordable price (30 ml for EUR 65), despite the high cost of natural formulas. In the perfume industry, it is rare to associate a fragrance and a chakra: Sérénité 4.0 corresponds to the fourth chakra, Désir 2.0 to the second, etc. The renewal we offer with Ajnalogie is also related to perfume application gestures. Each case is fitted with a pipette, a gentler, intimate and sensual application ritual which helps reconnect with yourself, your perfume, and sensorial energies. The spray is somewhat more mechanic, and this gesture in line with the “slow” trend is very popular. On Instagram, I regularly post ritual models, for example to explain how to apply the Confiance 5.0 perfume related to the throat chakra on the throat, with the pipette. Premium Beauty News - How do you see Ajnalogie’s future? Agathe Jacquinet - I would like to make people discover my brand in studios fully dedicated to wellness – cocoons where you can blend perfumes, meditation, skincare, etc. In the short term, of course, I will develop points of sale, although I do not think a “niche” concept store would really be adapted to my concept. I am also considering completing the range with two perfumes related to other chakras. But above all, I intend to create products which improve the notion of “wellness ritual”, like candles, for meditation, or sensual oil for the Désir 2.0 perfume. I am keen to target life moments when we need these smells. Ultimately, there will be a range of olfactory jewels to diffuse perfume like pomanders, by combining the virtues of stones and perfume plants."
Fiabila innovates to address risks related to semi-permanent gel nail polish,"Premium Beauty News - What are Fiabila’s main innovations this year? Alexandre Miasnik - Paradoxically, as consumers increasingly seek purity, naturalness, and safety, “gel” or “semi-permanent” nail polish is getting ever-more popular in most countries. The problem is that these products are loaded with monomers, which means they are harmful and comply neither with cosmetics regulations nor with most brands’ blacklists widely acknowledged on the nail polish market. Their occlusive nail films lead to a risk of allergies and damage for users, as well as a risk of skin or respiratory reactions for manicures. At Fiabila, developing alternative formulas using safe raw materials has been at the core of our R&D strategy for many years. As a result, we have put an emphasis on the development of UV-reactive techniques to exclude monomers, and we now offer two product ranges: Sun Prodigy, which reacts to natural UV rays and can be used at home, and Salon Prodigy, which is more professional, since it is applied under a LED lamp. Both can easily last up to 15 days and can be removed at home without difficulty. Meanwhile, we keep upgrading “conventional” formulas to achieve a high performance level, at least taking into account the current situation in terms of research and raw materials available. Premium Beauty News - It seems nail care is getting much stronger. Is it a key growth path for Fiabila? Alexandre Miasnik - Nail care is essential. All women or almost are concerned with breaking, weakened, or dry nails. The use of gels makes things worse, especially since, to cover bad-looking nails after application, most women conceal them with another application, which deprives nails of oxygen for weeks and alters their condition. The fact that salons closed during lockdown, preventing products from being removed, further compounded the problem. There is a high demand for strengthening nail care products, so we developed comprehensive ranges of products intended to repair and nourish nails, in particular by adding natural actives, vitamins, vegetable oils, and fruit extracts. Although these products are cosmetics, not drugs, we guarantee their efficacy with systematic tests on consumer panels. Also, to make our ranges more appealing, since they are often transparent among other products, we have coloured them, and even slightly perfumed a few for more pleasure of use, in particular to seduce younger consumers. Premium Beauty News - Has the notion of naturalness further evolved on the nail polish segment? Alexandre Miasnik - Naturalness is a notion that is getting lost among many others: organic, biosourced, clean, vegan, etc. In fact, consumers, and sometimes even brands, are often lost – or misled. For example, organic semi-permanent nail polish can be harmful, because it still contains allergenic raw materials. When it comes to nail polish, naturalness usually means previously petroleum-based raw materials are replaced by products derived from farming which offer exactly the same performance. It is a significant step forward: today, most range launches involve products of natural origin. Premium Beauty News - Many conventional brands claim their products are partly natural. What do you think about this? Alexandre Miasnik - What matters most is consumer safety. European cosmetics regulations and many others largely contributed to removing harmful substances from the market, and that’s all the better. At Fiabila, the search for increasingly pure ingredients led us to contribute to developing raw materials of natural origin for our formulas. Premium Beauty News - What about manufacturing processes? Do brands take them into account when developing clean formulas? Alexandre Miasnik - It is a key issue – our customers’ requirements in this field are extreme. Nail polish is a highly technical product; manufacturing requires much know-how. There is a double challenge: using a process which complies with specifications, while providing the performance required and, more recently, complying with very demanding manufacturing standards. At Fiabila, we have fitted our three main sites in France, the USA, and Brazil, with fully automated systems for manufacturing suspension bases, and we are the only ones to have this equipment. As a result, we deliver products with incredible quality consistency, we avoid contamination risks, and we minimize polluting emissions. Premium Beauty News - It seems the global nail polish market has taken advantage of the different lockdown periods. Can you confirm that? Alexandre Miasnik - Women never ceased wearing makeup; they kept buying products. But things do vary from one geographic region to another. In any case, obviously, many women who were used to going to salons applied their own nail polish themselves at home!"
Trade shows: The 2021 calendar focuses on the second half of the year,"Several trade shows initially scheduled for the first half of 2021 were quickly rescheduled when it became clear for everyone that the state of health emergency would be maintained for several months in a large number of countries. While waiting for a physical return, digital editions try to compensate for the lack of real-life encounters. In this context of permanent rescheduling, we tried to offer an updated overview on the current calendar of professional events to date:"
Skin Lab: The new skincare algorithm born out of lockdown,"Premium Beauty News - Can you please tell us a bit more about Skin Lab and how you came up with the idea? Joanna O’Connor - Skin Lab is an online source for independent personalised science-led skincare advice. There are no products, no brands and no advertising on the site. Skin Lab’s regime builder is an innovative tool for most women and men to understand what their skin really needs, independently and without bias or agenda. Board-certified dermatologists have recognised that there are 16 ’normal’ skin types. Our software uses the common questions a dermatologist would ask you on your first visit to identify what your skin type is, and then provides you with a personalised regime of essential and recommended ingredients that are most likely to help with your concerns. I often to say to my friends who asked me why I built Skin Lab for other people. You can go to a nutritionist and find out what foods hold the right nutritional content for you to achieve your goals or maintain a healthy lifestyle. Or you can go to a Michelin star chef who is going to give you a meal that will taste incredible, it’ll blow your mind, but it probably isn’t balanced with the nutrients your body needs, and you can’t live off it. The expensive, wonderfully packaged, great smelling, social influencer endorsed products we’re getting are our Michelin star meal. During Melbourne lockdown, I purchased a $400+ moisturiser that was celebrity endorsed and contained things like plant stem cell technology and packed and wrapped like a new iPhone. And I was excited. I had nowhere to go, and nothing else to do. I kept a skin diary, and I had zero results. I kind of had a meltdown. I wanted results! I had paid for results. So… I turned to the nutritionists of skincare. I started reading what the dermatologists were saying. I respected their 10 years of study into skin. I respected that they referenced unbiased scientific evidence. I noticed patterns. I started a scrap book. I joined the dots between common skin ailments, what the research and medical professionals were recommending, and then the products that some types of skin should stay away from. Skin Lab ultimately is a shrine to dermatologists, chemist and cosmetic doctors. The recommendations are a connection of the science, and algorithm behind the profession. It doesn’t replace going and having a one on one consultation with a professional that will analyse your skin. But, Skin Lab will help you step away from the brand hype and drama of social media, be able to read an ingredients label and look to find products that have actual ingredients that will work for you. Premium Beauty News - Is Skin Lab backed up by science? Joanna O’Connor - Absolutely. The purpose of Skin Lab is to cut through the marketing, the brand hype and the social media trends, and use the science and medical industry’s research and publicly available information. This information is out there, but brands skew it, social media debates it and the marketing is more shiny. Skin Lab doesn’t recommend a particular brand or product range. It recommends ingredients that the dermatologists are recommending. Like Dr Davin Lim, a dermatologist from Brisbane, advocating on his YouTube channel that a moisturiser shouldn’t cost you more than $40. Because the products that contain all the ingredients you need, are easily and cheaply available. They just aren’t packaged like an iPhone. Premium Beauty News - Do you have any experience in the skincare or science industries? Joanna O’Connor - I’m not a medical professional or a chemist. Skin Lab uses the recommendations of independent doctors with decades of study and clinical experience and research that takes the skill and understanding from the most respected and referenced researchers in the scientific community. I have however, over a decade of experience in spending all my discretionary income on skincare. Beauty therapy treatments. Fade potions and lotions. Natural ideologies. Powders and their promises. And my skin wasn’t bad, but I was seeing beauty therapists who were selling me laser treatments at $500+ a pop to deal with my melasma (pigmentation) and I felt it wasn’t worth it. Premium Beauty News - What can we expect to find on the Skin Lab website? Joanna O’Connor - Here’s what you won’t find: products, advertising or hype. We have three key areas of the site. The first is a glossary, so skincare enthusiasts can start understanding their alpha-hydroxy-acids from their antioxidants. The second is the Skin Wiki, where every article provides a link to the research, the doctors or chemists that provide the backing behind the recommendation. Then head to Build Your Regime, wait some precious seconds of anticipation for it to load, and straight up you’ll pay $10 and then start the journey to identify your skin type. Premium Beauty News - How does one go about building their skincare regime on site? Joanna O’Connor - The Regime Builder will ask a series of questions on your skin concerns and experiences, much like a dermatologist would on your first consultation. Based on the answers, your skin type is identified and with that you’ll be presented with a downloadable paper on what your skin needs, and what it doesn’t as well as two levels of regime, beginner and advanced. Advanced being for once your skin is tolerant to the actives you’ve introduced at the beginner stage. To use the Regime Builder and identify your skin type and get a personalised downloadable/printable regime it’s $10 – think of it as your first consult with a dermatologist, in fact we recommend taking yours to your dermatologist and cutting straight to your second visit having introduced the fundamentals to your regime already. Once someone knows the ingredient and concentration they need (e.g. 5% benzol peroxide), all they need to do is a google search of the ingredient and they can buy the product or the brand they prefer. Premium Beauty News - How did you come up with the algorithm? Joanna O’Connor - I found a pattern in what medically qualified skincare professionals were advocating and discussing. I started with an enthusiasm to understand it for myself, then for my friends, and then to make this advice more accessible to others. To do that, I identified that there are 16 different ‘normal’ skin types that each have ingredients that will work, and that should be avoided. With a bunch of mind maps and informational flow charts – I started building the algorithm behind the Skin Lab Regime Builder. Premium Beauty News - Do you have any plans on expanding any of these features? Joanna O’Connor - I do, but the key thing is that I get feedback from Skin Lab users. For now, I’ve had some great feedback from users about how it’s helped them and that’s a great starting place."
"“Skincare requires highly sophisticated solutions”, Bertrand Lasserre, Thépenier","Premium Beauty News - Thépenier Pharma & Cosmetics has belonged to Japanese group Nippon Shikizai since 2000. Bertrand Lasserre - Absolutely. But our business is quite different from our parent company’s. In Japan, Nippon Shikizai is mainly focused on makeup, whereas we primarily formulate water-based skincare, hygiene, and makeup products – in particular mascara and eyeliners. Thépenier Pharma & Cosmetics is specialized in liquid and emulsified cosmetics and hygiene formulas. Apart from the pharmaceutical segment, we are present on the oral care, clean beauty, and natural beauty markets. However, we do work in synergy with Nippon Shikizai and Nippon Shikizai France (formerly known as Orléans Cosmetics), which was acquired by TP&C in 2017, and whose business is much closer to our parent company’s: the production is 90% focused on anhydrous makeup, in particular powders, hot-poured products, and scented products. We share the same sales teams, so we can offer our customers an almost comprehensive range of cosmetics. Right now, pencils are the only products we cannot manufacture. Premium Beauty News - Still, you subcontract makeup more than skincare. Bertrand Lasserre - Things change very fast as regards subcontracting, in particular due to the emergence of new, very innovative brands in search of highly sophisticated turnkey solutions and mostly based on marketing concepts that do not involve an industrial tool. But it is also due to major brands’ growing need for reactivity, which pushes them to increasingly choose subcontracting in order to reduce development times and time-to-market. In fact, Thépenier Pharma & Cosmetics can work with both small emerging brands and major global players. We achieve 30% of our turnover with French customers and 70% through export, mainly in Europe and the USA (40%). Historically, we are a renowned player in oral care subcontracting, and we are still a major OTC producer in this category. But we are growing at a fast pace on the cosmetics segment – we have produced cosmetic products for over 30 years. Manufacturing in compliance with pharmaceutical GMPs has become highly differentiating – and a competitive advantage, to a certain extent, namely on all skincare segments related to clean beauty and to the technological healthcare trend, which have boomed since the COVID-19 crisis: they meet an rising consumer need for performance. In fact, we target the high-end segment of the cosmetics market. Our strategy is aimed to provide skincare subcontracting with added value and offer quality guarantees many of our competitors cannot offer. In this respect, I believe a standard offering will not be enough in the long run for a subcontractor to remain on the market. Premium Beauty News - Could you give a few practical examples? Bertrand Lasserre - We offer both formula ‘skeletons’ and turnkey solutions as part of a full-service offering in partnership with packaging leaders. Depending on our customers’ projects, we create the formula, produce it, and suggest a well-adapted pack, recycled or recyclable, whenever possible, in line with the brand’s expectations and the DNA of our product/service offering. What’s more, we take care of the filling phase and have internal quality control solutions. We actually deliver fewer and fewer bulk products. Following this principle, we have developed our own regulatory offering, partly with external partners. Plus, we integrate sales portfolios before launches to help brands answer the now systematic, increasingly specific questions they get asked on social media. Premium Beauty News - What are your main ambitions in terms of innovation? Virginie Barville - Right from the start, we endeavour to use responsible raw materials mainly sourced in France or Europe. Of course, we strictly comply with our customers’ specifications, but we systematically try to minimize the number of ingredients in our formulas, by incorporating multipurpose actives, without focusing on purely sensorial ingredients, and limit the use of potentially irritant preservatives. To meet our customers’ expectations, we also need to reduce time-to-market. To this aim, we can patent some of our active cocktails and formula skeletons, so we can offer bases to be personalized with actives, perfumes… We offer an extremely broad base range, so we can reduce development times to 6 months, or even less, as required by the brand - but we do not recommend to. Premium Beauty News - Could you provide a few recent examples of innovations? Virginie Barville - In line with the current trends, we developed a One-For-All cream which can be used as a skincare, face care, or even hair care product. We also designed a 96% natural whitening serum for teeth. It is a completely new gesture: you just drop serum on your toothbrush and use it with toothpaste, or alone as a cure. There is also our Scalp Serum to be applied at night combined with an anti-grey hair active to regulate the scalp microbiota for a global action on hair’s health. Lastly, we developed a natural mascara with one of the most accomplished technicity on the market. This mascara is a real eyelash care product: it is enriched with a plant extract derived from Chinese traditional medicine, which enhances lash growth and vitality. Premium Beauty News - How did 2020 go for the company? Bertrand Lasserre - It was quite satisfactory. The company had achieved a two-digit growth since 2015. Of course, the sanitary crisis impacted these dynamics. Thépenier Pharma & Cosmetics should end the year 2020 with a 2.5% to 3% growth rate. As for Nippon Shikizai France, they maintained strong momentum: the consolidated growth for our two European entities should reach 8% in 2020, compared to the 23% initially forecast. Premium Beauty News - What are your prospects for the future? Bertrand Lasserre - Our prospects for 2021 are still pretty uncertain, but we believe life will come back to normal in 2022. We had planned to open a sales office in China: the pandemic delayed the project, but it remains an objective for no later than 2022. We are also speeding up our CSR projects: we have undertaken to get the ISO 14001 certification by July 2021, and we are open to external growth opportunities."

"“The era of virtuous perfumes has started,” Valérie de la Peschardière","Premium Beauty News - Can you tell us about today’s consumer expectations for fine perfumery? Valérie de la Peschardière - Consumers still look for perfumes that make them dream, but they also want them to be safe for health and skin. Our consumer studies show that since the Covid-19 crisis, expectations have been evolving even faster: they are mainly related to what is good for health and the environment, and to naturalness in its broad sense. In addition, in France, health and skin protection gained 6 points, naturalness 9 points, and environmental protection, 7 points, while in the US, the first two expectations rose by 6 points. It should also be said that the cosmetics market transformed itself ten years ago! Premium Beauty News - What is an ecoresponsible perfume? Valérie de la Peschardière - It is a perfume whose formula contains eco-friendly ingredients, i.e. ingredients with a low environmental impact. As for natural ingredients, the objective is to improve farming practices in the countries of origin, and minimize the different steps and transport, by transforming raw materials locally, wherever possible. And as for synthetic ingredients, the idea is to apply green chemistry principles and go for biotechnologies! Premium Beauty News - How can natural perfumes become innovative and responsible? Valérie de la Peschardière - First, companies need to work on the plants they use - they should innovate with the fresh material locally, in the country of origin. We have also designed new extraction methods with a lower environmental impact, like flash distillation: we reduced the processing time from 24 hours to 20 minutes for a real innovative olfactory outcome and a much better carbon footprint. Besides, the spices obtained with flash distillation unveil all their freshness. In India, Givaudan designed ginger, turmeric and lemongrass: these products were co-developed with our partner Synthite. We also created a new Sambac jasmine absolute with them. Lastly, thanks to upcycling, we use either waste from other industries, including timber and juices, or our own residues. It is a technical feat which involves capturing the remaining micro-essential oils in their natural state. It is a very encouraging avenue for responsible perfumes with no environmental impact. Premium Beauty News - Do you have any examples of perfume brands? Valérie de la Peschardière - I am trash by État Libre d’Orange was an upcycling pioneer. Perfumer Marc-Antoine Barrois went even farther with Ganymede: he removed all preservatives. In the same vein, Thierry Mugler’s Angel Nova contains a highly natural Damask rose whose double extraction combines standard distillation and upcyling. This rose was developed solely for Thierry Mugler. Designed by Sonia Constant, Louise Turner and Quentin Bisch, this fragrance also features our akigalawood derived from biotechnologies. Here, Mugler emphasizes the use of upcycling-derived products - a first for a luxury perfume brand. Premium Beauty News - What is the role of products derived from biotechnologies in eco-responsible perfumery? Valérie de la Peschardière - These processes make it possible to create new responsible molecules, while preserving natural resources. Indeed, it is all based on an enzymatic reaction: the new odorous molecules are generated with very little material and require little energy. In the end, we obtain a biodegradable product with a low carbon footprint. For example, our Ambrofix is obtained using 100 times less natural resources. And it is a real olfactory wonder! Premium Beauty News - How is it possible to create new synthetic molecules, while preserving the environment? Valérie de la Peschardière - Thanks to our Five Carbon Path vision, all our new molecules are derived from renewable sources, transformed in accordance with green chemistry principles, and biodegradable. Since carbon atoms play a key role in perfume manufacturing, Givaudan set up a programme structured around five principles: increase the use of renewable materials, optimization of synthetic processes to decrease the carbon footprint, biodegradability of final molecules, increased “odour per carbon ratio” with materials with a strong olfactory impact, and optimisation of recycling and upcycling processes. Premium Beauty News - What remains to be done to enhance perfume plant cultures? Valérie de la Peschardière - For more than 15 years, many programmes have been implemented to support the whole chain and improve practices. Much progress has been made as regards iconic materials: patchouli, vetiver, vanilla, sandalwood, benzoin… We keep supporting the communities involved in the production of these natural materials, and we go further and further every year. This is why we settled in Madagascar to produce vanilla and clove. This year, we helped replant black pepper, which had disappeared for many years. To help farmers in these natural industries, Givaudan teaches good farming and agronomic practices. We develop ad hoc programmes, in particular to fight soil erosion in Haiti to save vetiver, or to promote soil regeneration in Indonesia and reforestation in Madagascar, where we planted over 500,000 trees to protect biodiversity… All this is possible thanks to our agronomic expertise, which directly comes from recent acquisitions, like Naturex."
"“The humanization of the digital is the next step,” Sabrina Herlory, M.A.C.","What was your experience of the lockdowns at M.A.C. Cosmetics? Sabrina Herlory - I’m not going to lie, it was - and still is - hard! But at the same time, it was exhilarating. The world to come is going to be like this: we’re all going to be disrupted 70,000 times in our lives and we’re going to have to get out of our comfort zone more regularly. For managers like me, this means making quick decisions based on partial information and no longer with full knowledge of the facts. And this is not an ability that can be learnt overnight, it’s a muscle that you train throughout your life. What measures have you taken to withstand the crisis? Sabrina Herlory - We have trained our sales consultants in ""virtual selling"", i.e. one-to-one personalized advice at a distance. This has been appreciated by the teams, who have suffered quite a lot during these periods of partial unemployment, which are very depressing. They realized that even if there was pressure on the retail sector, their occupation could evolve, thanks to digital technology and not disappear! And does ""virtual selling"" work for makeup? Sabrina Herlory - Many doubted it, but I can tell you that, yes, it’s very interesting from a human point of view and from a pure business point of view as well. The one-to-one digital concept is a bubble even more insulated than the physical experience in the store. It allowed us to maintain a connection with our customers, who are used to human interaction when buying makeup. We launched these virtual appointments in September 2020 and 70% of the customers who received advice remotely then moved on to a physical store. Real, remote personalized advice can channel traffic for brands when the stores reopen. Is the humanization of digital the next step? Sabrina Herlory - I’m convinced it is! This was the missing piece, and the lockdown allowed us to implement it, thanks to digital tools. It’s quite satisfying to say that yes, there has been an explosion of the digital, but what we’re learning is that consumers need to talk to real people! For me, the brands that understand this will be the ones that will remain sustainable. If we can prove that the humanization of digital is turning into R.O.I., live chats will be one-to-one, remote consultations will be one-to-one... Because we are all social animals with a real need for quality human interactions. And that goes beyond sales. What does that mean? Sabrina Herlory - Today, if a brand is not organically socially committed to a 360-degree project, I think it will not be able to count in the world to come: it’s ""how I treat customers, my suppliers, what footprint do I leave, how do managers treat their employees"". I see more and more managers deeply preoccupied by this global commitment. They often come from the next generation, I must say. They are socially engaged, and that’s very gratifying!"
Henkel gets even greener and launches Nature Box in France,"The group’s committed objectives are based on a thorough review of all formulas by 2021, to guarantee more naturalness and remove all controversial ingredients. In addition, by 2025, 100% of the packaging will be recyclable and reusable. “Our mission consists in being the pioneer of more sustainable, ecoresponsible cosmetics accessible to all. We aim to offer better products for the same price,” says Charlotte Le Buhan, Marketing Director of Henkel Beauty Care. In parallel, Henkel has been developing partnerships with associations, including Force Femmes, and enhancing products’ global life cycle, in particular by pooling transport with some competitors to reduce the environmental impact, and by launching a new programme  dubbed La beauté du geste to inform and educate consumers so they adopt more virtuous behaviours. Henkel is positioned on the highly competitive hair care and toiletries market driven by the organic wave. To better reach Millennials, they are now launching Nature Box, a fun, environmentally friendly brand. For its French launch, the range features five liquid shampoos and their solid equivalents, plus a conditioner. The formulas are composed of 99% natural ingredients derived from fair sourcing and enriched with cold-pressed hemp, coconut, nut, argan or avocado oil. Each reference is available as a liquid or solid product and packed in eco-packaging. “We mean to democratize solid shampoos, which have been rising strongly (+422% in 2019) but still only represent 0.3% of the market,” explains Cyrielle Léonard, Director of Hair Care. The liquid line will be available in supermarkets as soon as January 2021 for EUR 4.50 (250 ml bottle), and solid sizes will be launched next March for the same price. A specific men’s range will also be released in April. With the new Natural & Easy range, Schwarzkopf achieves total and long-lasting white hair coverage with formulas composed of 91% to 93% ingredients of natural origin. The growth of the at-home hair colouring segment since lockdown – +1.2 million women recruited on this market, according to Kantar – gets mixed with the demand for more natural products. The Schwarzkopf offering already featured a range of non-permanent botanical dyes; it now counts an exclusive solution. The 10-shade Natural & Easy range will be available as soon as next January for the target price of EUR 9.90. Launched two years ago, the 100% organic cosmetics brand has found its own place in supermarkets. Ranked second in value on the organic hygiene/beauty segment, and third in the face cream category, NAE is now broadening its offering with an Ecocert-certified smoothing anti-ageing line composed of 99% ingredients of natural origin. The three products, a day cream, a night cream, and a serum, will be available next March. Present on the face care market for over 100 years, Diadermine is reinventing itself with a new skincare ritual based on natural retinol. The three new products of the Lift + Algo Retinol range, a day cream, a night cream, and an eye contour, are based on botanical actives harvested in Brittany, France: sea fennel and algae extracts. These products will be available next January."
"“2021 will be better than anticipated”, says Sérgio Sampaio, Grupo Boticário","In a previous interview last August, André Farber, vice president of sales at Boticário Group told Premium Beauty News the Covid-19 pandemic and the temporary closure of all chain stores forced the company to reassess all its expectations for 2020. A month later, in September, Grupo Boticário’s factories in Bahia and Paraná announced they had broken their quarterly production records. The company had never produced that much since the O Boticário brand was founded, more than 40 years ago. “Indeed, the year was very unusual. What we predicted for 2020 has changed a lot over the past few months, and it shows that our dedication and the path traced by the teams worked out,” commented Sérgio Sampaio, the group’s Director of Operations. “We knew how to act since the beginning of the pandemic to steer our business and reduce the impacts caused by the crisis and not letting it dominate us. This allowed us to reach this record, which we are very proud of”. Compared to January, February and March 2020 (before the lockdown), the production of July, August and September rose by 8.98%, representing the highest volume recorded in a quarter. Sales of O Boticário, the group’s historic brand, were driven by the rising demand for hygiene and personal care products. Sales of skin care creams, in particular, increased by 14.5% over the period. Sales of liquid soaps and shampoos also contributed to this record. “At the beginning of the pandemic, consumers were looking for essential hygiene items, such as hand sanitizers and antibacterial soaps. Then, we saw some other categories gain strength, such as hair care and skin care,” said Sampaio. “With no or little access to professional services, the ‘do it yourself’ trend has gained a lot of momentum. It is a matter of indulgence, of taking care oneself. People had to stay at home, but they wanted to feel good about themselves.” In order to meet this high demand amid the peak of the Covid-19 crisis in Brazil, Grupo Boticário needed to readjust. “From the very beginning, we dedicated much efforts to provide ideal working conditions, by allowing all of our staff to work from home and by reorganizing the company’s areas of densification, so that those who had to be at their posts could do it safely,” said Sampaio. “As far as the factories are concerned, we drastically reduced production, maintaining only some lines for items such as hand sanitizers and soaps. When stores reopened, our plants gradually resumed their activity and, to protect everyone’s health, we extended the shift of employees from three to four, thus reducing the number of people being inside the factory at the same time,” he added. The group also deemed necessary to open yet another distribution centre to be able to absorb the increase in volume and dispatch production. ""Located in the city of Campina Grande do Sul, Paraná, the new distribution centre will help us a lot,"" said the director of operations. It will ensure the logistics of e-commerce sales for the brands O Boticário, Eudora and Quem Disse, Berenice? for delivery to different regions of the country. Despite the immense challenges imposed by Covid-19, Sérgio Sampaio said to be proud of what has been achieved this year and optimistic about 2021. “The work we have done had allowed us to close 2020 in a very positive way and to believe that 2021 will be better than what we anticipated at the start of this crisis,” he concluded."
"With Beautylitic, ANJAC steers the clean transformation of cosmetic formulations","At a time when consumers are stating their preference for simpler, healthier and more natural beauty solutions free of controversial ingredients, the ANJAC Health & Beauty group is joining forces with Beautylitic, a SaaS BtoB platform for the scientific analysis and evaluation of the composition of beauty and personal care products. After having first appealed to distributors and pure players in e-commerce, eager to better meet the expectations of their customers in terms of clean beauty, Beautylitic is taking its first steps alongside a leading manufacturer. ""A healthier and more transparent beauty concerns all brand profiles and the entire industry, each with its specificities. Brands need benchmarks and therefore data,"" explains Anne Rutigliano, Marketing and Communication Director at ANJAC Health & Beauty. However, with no regulated standards, clean beauty is poorly-defined and relies heavily on the experience of laboratories. ""It was becoming necessary for us to find a tool to characterise and position the clean solutions offered by the ANJAC group’s R&D laboratories and thus display the possible solutions transparently,"" continues Anne Rutigliano. Designed to dynamically analyse thousands of references and more efficiently control referencing or development choices, the Beautylitic platform draws on algorithms that take into account a large number of constantly updated data, including ingredient regulations and scientific studies that potentially characterise a robust controversy. Beautylitic thus allows calculating an ""Exposcore"", a score of exposure to controversial ingredients, or to anticipate the ratings that will be attributed by the leading cosmetic evaluation applications (such as Yuka in France, EWG in the United States, or Beauty Evolution in China). An assessment of the formula’s impact on natural resources and the environment is also available in a beta version. ""It is first a scientific tool,"" underlines Candice Colin, founder of the platform. ""Today, ingredients have become a key element in deciding whether to buy a product or not. It is therefore important for manufacturers to have tools that allow them to position themselves against the market. Beautylitic provides a concrete answer to the management of the transformation process."" By integrating Beautylic to its innovation approach, the ANJAC group can thus offer its customers an objective and scientific positioning regarding the various formulas proposed by a brand, or of formulas in the process of being created and in relation to the clean beauty universe. ""It is an unbiased tool that brings transparency to discussions. But we approach clean beauty with a lot of flexibility, respecting the DNA of each brand. Of course, this approach is optional,"" explains Anne Rutigliano. ""All our R&D, marketing and sales teams have been trained on the tool with the Beautylitic team. Thus upstream of our internal innovations and customer projects, we can assess the Clean performance of our formulas and challenge them to the maximum, highlighting the strengths but also the levers to go further in the Clean approach,"" adds Pierre Planes, Innovation and R&D Director at Sicaf Cosmétiques, and Chairman of the R&D committee of the ANJAC group. The platform complements the various tools already implemented by the ANJAC Health & Beauty group to provide its customers with personalised and qualified services in the development of formulas meeting consumer expectations, ""without compromising on sensoriality or efficiency, and while respecting the identity of brands."" The industrial partner is thus betting on a streamlined approach to the concept of clean beauty."
Teaology Skincare continues growth trajectory despite tough context,"Premium Beauty News - What is Teaology Skincare about? Paolo and Cecilia Bevegni - At the core of Teology there is a patented technology that enable us to use tea infusions instead of water in the product formulations. We source the most precious teas from all over the world. As a consequence, products offer an extraordinary high concentration of natural active ingredients. Indeed, the tea plant is the most powerful natural source of antioxidant polyphenols. This means our formulas contain 100% active ingredients. We are currently distributed in about 30 countries around the world and our best results are coming today from Europe and Canada. Premium Beauty News - What were the consequences of the pandemic for the brand? Paolo and Cecilia Bevegni - As far as Europe is concerned, the pandemic hit a market that was already growing slowly. Lockdowns had a very strong impact and the increase of online sales did not compensate the drop of the brick-and-mortar business. Recent developments do not allow much optimism till the end of the year. Nevertheless, Teaology will register a significant double-digit growth in 2020, due in particular to the positive development in North America and the launch of new products. Premium Beauty News - What did the COVID-19 crisis change?  Paolo and Cecilia Bevegni - Beside the switch to online sales, it seems that the crisis has accelerated awareness of consumers toward sustainability and fuelled the demand for more responsible cosmetic products. As a of clean beauty and sustainable brand, this helped us to consolidate our position in many markets. Premium Beauty News - What are your plans for the next years? Paolo and Cecilia Bevegni - International growth is our priority. We believe that our message is truly international. Tea is the most popular drink on the world after water, so our concept is positively perceived everywhere. Despite a tough context this year, we did not stop any development projects and we launched very successful new lines, such as our Yoga Care line that turned out to be our best seller this year. Also for 2021 we have different new launches in the pipeline. We think that even in the current situation the market needs and deserves novelties and new concepts. Premium Beauty News - And regarding sustainability? Paolo and Cecilia Bevegni - Sustainability is one of our first priorities, we are convinced that today we simply cannot avoid to study carefully how our decisions are impacting our environment and our world. From the beginning we have been choosing only sustainable formulas and packaging and we been doing our best to help our customers to minimize the impact of our products. In addition, we are support some tea farmers communities in Sri Lanka that give us extraordinary teas."
Weckerle responds to crisis with safe & sustainable lipstick sample,"If the global makeup market was shaken by the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, nothing better describes the German group’s reactivity and flexibility than their impressive capacity to adjust during this period. When consumers turned their backs on lipsticks, the group started to produce their very first protective masks. “The R&D Division of Weckerle Machines quickly developed fully automated processes to produce masks,” explains Franz Gilg, COO of Weckerle Holding. First implemented in China, the concept is now operational in Germany. Today, Weckerle Machines provides machines, while Weckerle Cosmetics produces masks for their customers. The whole group very quickly got familiar with a field which does not have much to do with their historic business. Reactivity is probably the group’s key strength: they managed to build up a unique network based on local presence, with plants on four continents (Europe, Asia, North America, and South America) and a 360-degree expertise: machine manufacturing, full-service offering, packaging design and manufacturing, but also product formulation and filling. “One of our customers’ main expectations is a fast time-to-market. And to reduce delivery lead times, one needs short supply chains. If it all comes from China, it’s unmanageable.” This is what Thomas Weckerle, CEO of Weckerle Companies, told Premium Beauty News last year. And his words were visionary: neo-localism is getting increasingly popular. In 2018, the group inaugurated a site in Torrace, California, and in 2019, two new production sites were opened in Ranipur, India, and in Huamantla, Mexico. At the peak of the crisis, the group was able to rely on this “global local production” strategy. “Today, the situation varies a lot from one region to another. In China, demand is growing again. In South America, after a sudden slowdown, direct-selling local players reacted very quickly and the market soon recovered. To better meet each market’s specific needs, we decided to give our subsidiaries even more autonomy,” explains Franz Gilg. With a production capacity of 25 million units per year, the new French plant, which was completely rebuilt after a fire destroyed the previous site in 2018, was designed to meet all brands’ needs. The group’s reactivity is also based on their capacity to innovate. In this field, vertical integration is a significant strength. Over the past two years, the Californian, Mexican, and German sites were equipped with Multi Stick 3 (MS3), the latest generation of casting, moulding, and filling machines, which are more efficient, faster, and more resource-efficient. As for products, after unveiling Myconic, a 100% single-material lipstick tube entirely made of recycled plastic, at the beginning of the year, Weckerle is now launching Click’N Break, a mini single-use lipstick tube (0.04 ml) designed for consumers to test products in optimum hygiene and sensorial conditions. The single-material pack can be made of recycled PET or biosourced PP, and a biodegradable solution is also under study. The tube is fitted with a both easy and safe cap for perfect hygiene. These launches are in line with the group’s strategy to adopt circular economy principles: they aim to offer 100% recyclable or reusable packaging by 2025."
Matière Première enters booming Chinese perfume market,"Present in China for 16 years, Grégoire Grandchamp created Next Beauty with wife Lulu Yu, former Vice-President of L’Oréal China. They aim to invest and help “gem” brands make their own place in the local beauty industry. They look for brands with a unique, authentic history and a strategy focused on a positive impact on both the environment and society. But above all, they emphasize the crucial significance of the leading teams. Already an exclusive partner of several beautiful brands, Next Beauty is now helping Matière Première enter the Chinese market with a high-end fragrance range designed by Aurélien Guichard, Creative Director of Takasago. “We must remain cautious, but if we look at the facts, in China, there are a few major perfume leaders, like Dior and Chanel, who represent about 50% of the market, and then a few other brands are overrepresented, like Atelier Cologne, Byredo, Dyptique, Jo Malone, and more recently, Francis Kurkdjian, Frédéric Malle, and Maison Martin Margiela. There is definitely something about niche perfumes. Chinese customers are genuinely interested,” explains Grégoire Grandchamp. This group of customers mainly gathers Millennials and the Generation Z, who seek distinction and differentiation. “They have no complex and are really partial to emerging brands. 20-year-old consumers are much more sophisticated than their elders on all beauty categories – and not just beauty – so it is only natural for them to take interest in perfumes. The market is taking off, in particular niche brands,” adds Grégoire Grandchamp. Perfumes and the relationship with perfumes are actually changing on this market, one of the biggest in the world, which is still fond of light, mainly floral and fruity trails. “Rose is the most popular ingredient, but I am sure there is something to be done to understand and identify smells evocative of the Chinese culture. Something more in line with their memories and history,” explains the expert. The development of Matière Première is structured around the scheduled opening in 2021 of a flagship store in Shanghai and pop-up stores in other cities, but it is also based on a strategy resolutely oriented towards digitalism, e-, and social-commerce. “It is all based on a broad collaboration with KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders) and on product offerings adapted to e-commerce as soon as the next quarter, including very smart discovery sets featuring mini products for testing fragrances. We are also our brands’ unique Tmall [1] partner,” says Grégoire Grandchamp. Last but not least, to speed up their global development, Matière Première recently raised 1.3 million euros – here is a brand to keep an eye on."
Geka invests and banks on market recovery,"Integrated to Swiss group Sulzer in 2016, German company Geka developed know-how in beauty packaging solutions as soon as 1925. Driven by make-up market dynamics, they achieved a EUR 150 million turnover in 2019 and count 1,000 employees around the world, four production sites based in Bechhofen, Germany (headquarters), São Paulo, Brazil, Elgin, near Chicago, Illinois, and Shanghai, China, and two sales offices in France and Poland. “We are present on four continents, because it is crucial to be in line with our customers’ needs,” explains Geka CEO Florent Lafont, who considers developing an additional solution for the African continent in the long run. In light of the growing demand of the American market, in particular of indie brands, the company completed its full-service offering, already operational in Germany, in the Elgin plant. Since 2019, the site has provided production, decoration, and filling services thanks to a new automated filling and capping machine with a capacity of 15 million units per year. The Shanghai plant, shared with Sulzer, was also enhanced by integrating Geka’s unique expertise in injection moulding, decoration by printing, manufacturing, and product development in colour cosmetics. This way, the company got closer to their ever-increasing client base in Asia and to the Chinese market, which is booming again in the post-COVID era. Lastly, major investments were made to extend the main site in Bechhofen: 10,000 m2 will be added to the current 12,000 m2 to concentrate all activities and divisions, which used to be spread across several sites in Germany, including the former Oeka site in Bamberg, purchased in 2015. “We aim to create stronger synergies, gain flexibility, and reduce delivery lead times,” says Florent Lafont. The production tool will be operational as soon as January 2021: it is being enhanced with new technologies, decoration capacities, and improved automation. In addition, Geka endeavours to focus their strategy on all areas of improvement as regards carbon footprint and sustainability, both in terms of production processes and products. “We are more than ever focused on digitalization, innovation, development, and environmental issues,” highlights the CEO. Last September, the company won the Platinium prize awarded by Ecovadis, which certifies companies’ sustainability, so they are now ranked among the 1% best companies assessed around the world. As for alternative packaging solutions, the Reborn collection unveiled last June offers eye and lip makeup products with sustainable packaging containing 93% recycled materials or biosourced alternatives. An expert in mascara brushes, and even a pioneer in moulded brushes, with 122 million units produced in 2019, Geka also boasts know-how in the development of applicators, containers, and finished products for all beauty segments. “From nail varnish to hair accessories and lipsticks, we are definitely equipped to offer our added value to a large number of categories. It is our strategy for the future,” concludes Florent Lafont."
"“Demand for transparency is huge in the cosmetics industry”, Ana Ledesma, NATRUE","Premium Beauty News - Demand for naturalness has been a basic trend for several years in the cosmetics industry. And it seems it has further strengthened with the Covid-19 pandemic. Ana Ledesma - Absolutely. There is a huge need for transparency in our industry, a demand for information about ingredients, their origins, manufacturing processes… Consumers want safe, environmentally friendly and fair products. The need for safety that emerged during the pandemic and the growing concern about our planet’s condition have just strengthened expectations. No one can say sustainability is a trend now. It has become a real lifestyle, a particular way to shop - and it is booming. Consumers want multipurpose, sustainable products in line with their beliefs. Premium Beauty News - Labels are also used to inform consumers. But NATRUE remains little known in France and the UK, whereas it is widely recognized in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Ana Ledesma - Today, over 7,000 products are NATRUE-certified, mainly in Europe, which is the area that is most aware of labels, but also in North and South America, and in the Asia-Pacific area. We aim to further develop our label on the global level. More than 300 natural and organic cosmetics brands in the world already trust the NATRUE label as a product certification. The Cosmebio and COSMOS labels have been present in Western and Southern Europe for a long time. NATRUE is more widely known in Austria, Switzerland, and Germany, which is the country of origin of several founding members of the association. To develop the label’s presence on the French market, we have attended the Natexpo show in France for several years. This year, we shared our stand with French organic cosmetics brand Beauty Garden. A label like NATRUE guarantees the same requirements and transparency for consumers all over the world. Premium Beauty News - NATRUE has announced the label has been simplified: there will now be two levels instead of three. Ana Ledesma - We tried to make our label easier to understand for consumers. Starting from January 1st, 2021, the standard will no longer include three, but two product levels: natural cosmetics and organic cosmetics. The products labelled as “natural cosmetics with an organic portion” will keep this designation on the market until their two-year certificate expires. But we paid attention not to reduce our level of requirements: on the contrary, we have introduced new criteria, in particular as regards environmental protection and raw material sourcing. Premium Beauty News - As a label, what do you think about the naturalness claims related to standard ISO 16128 or to the notion of clean beauty? Ana Ledesma - We had great hopes when we heard about an ISO standard on cosmetics naturalness. But clearly, the guarantees and assurances are quite low compared to what a label like NATRUE can offer. As regards clean beauty, our stance is most probably the same as other labels’. It cannot be denied that this notion involves positive changes and compels brands to give up on certain ingredients. It is a broad concept that is beyond the organic and natural notions. But, for us, it is a claim which lacks clarity and can be misleading. Today, brands can have much different interpretations of the notion of clean beauty. Without common criteria and independent certification, there is definitely a risk of greenwashing and of certain criteria not being more demanding than what basic compliance with current regulations demand. Labels’ specifications are made public and involve known criteria which can be verified and - as for NATRUE - are controlled by independent bodies. In addition, natural and organic cosmetic labels are not just formulations that avoid certain substances undesired by consumers: they include many environmental criteria. Premium Beauty News - Do applications which mark products not contribute to offering more transparency? Ana Ledesma - Applications may be an interesting reference for consumers if the information provided is objective and comprehensive. But some of them are actually incomplete and their assessments lack objectivity and scientific rigour. Not all applications use the same criteria, so not all of them offer reliable information! Overall, most tend to play on the fear of certain ingredients. NATRUE’s mission is to offer consumers as many guarantees as possible regarding natural and organic cosmetics. It is a way to increase trust in products, and we keep working on increasing the level of information and transparency for the mutual benefit of manufacturers and consumers, in particular through our public database of NATRUE-certified products and raw materials."
How Nippon Shikizai France adjusts its offer to the pandemic,"For manufacturers specializing in make-up products, the current situation is particularly challenging. Lockdowns, remote working and masks have transformed beauty routines! Broadly speaking, the no-make-up trend is rising with women giving-up on color cosmetics, a shift that has a strong impact on sales. In France, according to an Ifop study, 44% of women consumers never wear makeup when they are working from home. However, while skin tone products and lipsticks are suffering, eye makeup and skincare are doing better. “This coronavirus crisis has raised new expectations among consumers. For us, it was therefore essential to adapt to the market and to think about products adapted to the current health situation,” says Tsuyoshi Hasuo, President of Nippon Shikizai France and Thépenier Pharma & Cosmetics. Nippon Shikizai France therefore focused on the consequences of wearing a protective mask. “The constant humidity under the mask causes the skin to dry out and cause irritation. As for the breathing that rises to the top of the face, it has the effect of removing what is called the ‘curling’ effect of a mascara and the eyeliners lose their ‘long-lasting’ properties. As for the lipstick, of course, it leaves marks on the inside of the mask,” adds Tsuyoshi Hasuo. The company therefore worked on several products. In particular on a new liquid foundation (Skin Veil Foundation) which creates a sort of second veil on the face during its application and allows to maintain a healthy complexion despite wearing the mask all day. It is a very comfortable texture that does not give that sticky or sticky feeling. “We recommend to use it with a loose powder from our collection which allows a good fixation of this foundation,” details the manager. As far as the lips are concerned, it is now important to meet new needs linked to facial covering, without forgetting underlying trends such as the need for more natural and more comfortable products. Nippon Shikizai thus created a new paraben-free, silicon-free, preservative-free, surfactant-free and nanomaterial-free lip balm, with a creamy moisturizing texture that glides on the lips without generating a sticky feeling. As for the lip cream (Cream to Matte Lipstick), it was designed to avoid transferring the red colour to the mask. Its texture may be creamy, but it offers a matte finish on the lips without colour transfer to the mask. And the colour stays on all day. It fixes well on the lips. This product is still free of parabens, mineral oils, nanomaterials and petroleum-derived raw materials. For the eyes, Nippon Shikizai has developed a Curling Waterproof mascara that keeps lashes curled all day, despite the moisture escaping from the mask towards the top of the face. “It lengthens lashes separately without lumps or smudging.” The approach is the same for the new Waterproof Eyeliner, which is both extremely resistant and very easy to remove, thanks to its combination of polymers. “This pandemic places enormous strain on our daily lives, that of our customers and consumers. It generates both gloom and stress. In the midst of all this, we must not forget that our sector is also an opportunity. We manufacture optimism and pleasure. It is therefore very important that we fulfill this mission as well as possible, especially during this period, by developing new formulas that meet the needs of our customers,” concludes Tsuyoshi Hasuo."
"""We are continually lightening our impact on the planet"", Kate Forbes, Aesop","Premium Beauty News - Aesop has received carbon neutral certification under Climate Active for their Australian operations. How does this materialize exactly? Kate Forbes - As a company founded on steadfast ethics, our intention has always been to tread as lightly as we can, with an unwavering commitment to quality, excellence and sustainability across ideas and formulations. Climate Active is an independent carbon neutral certification administered by the Australian government to certify businesses and organisations that are measuring, reducing and offsetting their emissions, with a net result of zero emissions. The certification covers Aesop operations in Australia from January 2018 to June 2020 and includes, stores, office, digital dispatch and freight to and from our third-party global distribution centre located in Melbourne. We continue our efforts to a sustainable future and are working actively towards all Aesop spaces operating on renewable energy by 2023. As part of the Natura &Co group we are developing our climate action plan to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2030 and establish a science-based emission reduction target by June 2021. This is well underway with ongoing reduction initiatives in our largest sources of emissions: freight, corporate travel and energy. These initiatives include a continued transition to renewable energy, an improved inventory planning tool to optimize freight and reduction in corporate travel through virtual tools. In 2019, we reduced our emissions from flight activity by 7%. Premium Beauty News - What are Aesop’s other initiatives to reduce your environmental footprint? Kate Forbes - Several initiatives have been established that focus on packaging, raw material procurement, waste and e-commerce. We are committed to establishing practices that design out waste and support the continued use of our packaging. This topic of conversation allowed Aesop to share our current circularity journey, including the introduction of our packaging re-use trial which has just launched in Adelaide late last month. Moreover, we have increased the amount of recycled content used in our packing with over 70% of Aesop PET plastic bottles made from a minimum of 97% recycled PET sourced from post-consumer recycled content. While our current recycled content in packaging performance surpasses trends and targets being set by the industry, we acknowledge that considerable work remains necessary to improve the circularity of our packaging range and we strive towards our goal for all packaging to be reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. Premium Beauty News - How does the brand combine luxury and sustainability? Kate Forbes - We do not consider there to be a disconnect between luxury and sustainability; each one of us should be of the mindset that it is our responsibility to care for the environment in which we live, making a conscious effort to influence positive social and environmental change. Throughout Aesop’s thirty-three years, we have adhered to a fiercely independent approach to skin care; always aiming to deliver products of premium efficacy and sensory pleasure through solid science, uncomplicated packaging and an unwavering sense of humour. We have also maintained a commitment to service of the highest calibre for our customers. We are meticulous in selecting and sourcing ingredients, ensuring each is chosen with the health and safety of our customers and the natural environment foremost in mind. We are on a journey of ever lightening our tread on the planet that generously sustains us while formulating products of the highest quality and efficacy. Beyond the environment, our strategy includes initiatives that will help nurture an inclusive, engaged culture, where all employees are empowered to contribute to strategy, develop and thrive. Premium Beauty News - Concerning the Covid-19 crisis, did you notice any change in consumer habits? Kate Forbes - It is perhaps no surprise that while we have all been enjoying the comfort of our homes a lot more than usual, we have seen rises in our home and body care category. Quite specifically, in the UK, we have seen sales of the Brass Oil Burner experience a quintupled uplift on aesop.com, while the accompanying oil burner blends have soared with more than a 200% rise. On a global level, our home category is experiencing more than a two-fold YOY growth, which ties nicely with the expansion of this offering as we have just this month launched our first trio of Aromatique Candles, formulated in collaboration with French perfumer, Barnabé Fillion. We have already seen a positive response from our customers and anticipate as the current restrictions continue, in one form or another, this type of product will continue to be appealing to those looking to heighten their sensory surroundings at home. Beyond this category, and in line with the current climate, we have also seen a rise in our body care category, with sales almost tripling. While the everyday act of cleansing may once have furnished a relatively routine beginning or end to the day, our perspective on this has changed and we look to find joy and pleasure in the smallest of rituals. There seems to be an emphasis on the mood-enhancing benefits that a favourite aromatic blend can bring to the act of cleansing bringing a sense of luxury to our new normal."
"Perfect Diary, the Chinese unicorn with global ambitions","Few Chinese cosmetics brands can boast catching the Western press’s attention as much as Perfect Diary (完美日记). The young brand actually achieved an outstanding performance in China: on November 11, 2018 Singles’ Day, a little over a year after it was launched, Perfect Diary got ranked first among Chinese makeup brands. In 2019, the sales on that special day dedicated to singles reached RMB100 million in 13 minutes on Tmall, overtaking global brands like L’Oréal and Maybelline. Perfect Diary mainly targets Generation Z young women aged 18-28, who are more interested in national brands than previous generations. The brand quickly managed to stand out with an innovative online marketing strategy. According to China-based consulting agency Daxue Consulting, beyond promoting the brand on general social platforms Weibo and WeChat, Perfect Diary also takes advantage of the Xiaohongshu community, where 50% of users are less than 30, and of Bilibili: 80% of its users were born in the 1990s. In addition, they partnered with celebs and KOLs in line with the brand, as could be seen with Li Jiaqi, the “Chinese king of lipstick”. In parallel, Perfect Diary created a KOC virtual character, Xiaowanzi (小完子), who shares characteristics with the brand’s target consumers and plays different roles: beauty advisor, friend, promotional information supplier, and customer service in real time. This virtual KOC helps the brand build closer relationships with customers and convert public traffic into private, less expensive traffic. “The Perfect Diary strategy is a textbook case to learn how to get rid of marketplaces,” says Daxue Consulting. “They take advantage of the KOL strategy and create brand recognition on social media platforms to boost the purchase desire. Then, they integrate these external resources to their private traffic pool on WeChat, which encourages customers to re-purchase their products and become loyal.” And yet, in an interview in the Forbes magazine, Vincent Chen, co-founder of Yatsen Global, Perfect Diary’s parent company based in Guangzhou, insists upon defining the brand’s basics: “You don’t build up a reputation thanks to marketing, but by maintaining consistency between word-of-mouth and product quality. The ‘product power’ drives the development and growth of Perfect Diary.” The brand’s manufacturing partners are mentioned on the website: Italian company Intercos and Korean company Cosmax. According to Reuters, Perfect Diary will open their own manufacturing site in Guangdong by late 2021. Available for affordable prices, Perfect Diary makeup products are well-adapted to social media sharing. Riding the wave of young Chinese people’s taste for cultural consumer goods, Perfect Diary signed collaborations with the London British Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC. These agreements led in particular to a limited edition of eight lipsticks showcased in packaging which evoked playing cards depicting royal portraits belonging to museum collections, including Louis XIV, Queen Victoria, and Napoleon. In the same playful, photogenic spirit, Perfect Diary contacted the Discovery and National Geographic China channels to create eyeshadow palettes inspired from the savannah fauna and Chinese landscapes. According to co-founder Vincent Chen, Perfect Diary’s online/offline model was one of its main advantages when dealing with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. When physical stores had to close, shop assistants turned into live streaming hosts. “Last February, the number of Perfect Diary live streaming sessions hosted on Alibaba’s Taobao platform rose by 28% compared to January, and sales increased by about 170%,” he explains in his interview to Forbes. Currently present in the largest Chinese cities, Perfect Diary aims to open 600 stores across China over the next three years to cover all city categories. “This year, our programme to launch 200 stores will be focused on mid-sized cities,” Vincent Chen announces. Yet, he acknowledges that “e-commerce still accounts for most of our sales”. However, he believes that “physical stores will become a key segment for Yatsen Global and will experience the fastest growth in the years to come.” In June 2020, the group announced they were about to launch a new, skincare-oriented brand called Abby’s Choice. They also confirmed their global ambitions. According to the Chinese press, the new USD140-million fundraising is a prerequisite to soon become listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Will Perfect Diary make up for the lack of Chinese beauty, fashion, and lifestyle brands on the international level, when this is so beneficial to soft power and to seducing a country? This lack is all the more significant given the success of Japanese and Korean brands."
Lancôme acquires a rose-farm in Grasse to strengthen their DNA,"Lancôme has acquired an estate in Grasse, the historical cradle of contemporary French perfumery. Dubbed Domaine de la Rose by Lancôme, the estate is comprised of 9.9 acres organically farmed fields, centuries-old terraces as well as a distillery. “This estate has been cultivated for around five centuries and the family, who previously owned the estate, is one of the pioneers of organic cultivation of perfume plants in Grasse. Thanks to this exceptional estate, Lancôme becomes an owner and producer of organic roses that will be used in our fragrances,” said Françoise Lehmann, Lancôme Global Brand President. Lancôme is already well established in the region through the exploitation of a 12-acre field in Valensole, where are grown the proprietary and exclusive to Lancôme roses as well as the Centifolia rose that are used in its skin care products. The brand has also been exploiting a field in Grasse where the Centifolia rose, jasmine and lavender are cultivated for its fragrances. These three domains represent a total of 24.7 acres, and all benefit from the unique geographical location and climatic influences of the Grass area. Lancôme’s ultimate ambition is to use all parts of the rose bush - from the flower, to the petal, up to the stem and even the root - to develop new active ingredients with a “zero waste” approach in all production processes. While the rose is Lancôme’s emblem, other flowers are used in brand’s signature products. Beyond the existing crops that Lancôme will continue to develop - including roses, olive trees, plum trees, fig trees - the brand will grow emblematic plants of the Grasse region such as iris, jasmine, lavender, bitter orange, tuberose, and osmanthus, ancient aromatic plants including immortelle, verbena and Madonna lily, as well as beehives, in a spirit of biodiversity preservation and development. The L’Oréal-owned brand also said this new acquisition would be an opportunity to contribute to the international promotion of the unique treasures of the Grasse region, which have been classified as an intangible cultural heritage by the UNESCO. “Lancôme is also keen on sharing know-how around the Rose to internal and external audiences in a spirit of learning and transmission,” added Françoise Lehmann. In recent years, the Grasse area has seen renewed investment from the various players of perfumery and cosmetics industry, including leading perfume houses like Firmenich and Givaudan, and luxury brands like Dior, or its parent company LVMH. These initiatives respond to consumers’ expectations for authenticity, natural ingredients and shorter, more local and more traceable supply chains."
“Blissim aims to seize beauty growth opportunities online”,"Premium Beauty News - You separated from the Birchbox group a few months ago. What does this name change hide? Quentin Reygrobellet - We have had a rather unique business model for ten years, and it changed consumption in France as regards the digital and beauty worlds. With this name, it was important for us to step up and show the market and our consumers we were not just a box, but much more: a real ecosystem which helps all women find their own corresponding beauty in a very simple way. We want to show we are a leader in digital cosmetics. The idea was to choose a name with an international, easily understandable connotation, as “Bliss” is English and “issime” marks an absolute superlative in French. The letter B is a nod to Birchbox, it evokes femininity, and the double “i” in “Blissim” makes us smile when pronouncing it, just like women when they receive their products. Premium Beauty News - What are Blissim’s objectives? Quentin Reygrobellet - The online beauty market grows at an annual rate of 15% to 20%, and the crisis has made it boom even more. Offline sales are increasingly being transferred online. Since the beginning, in 2011, we have endeavoured to build a bridge between the physical and digital networks. Thanks to our box, we recreate the discovery experience with products available in stores, but which women receive directly at home along with customization and advice. This initial strategy is even more meaningful now, and that is also why we are one of the players that have grown the most on the digital segment. We aim to go even farther. We achieve almost a 50-million-euro turnover with an annual growth rate of 25% compared to the previous year. In three to four years, the digital beauty market will weigh three or four billion euros, so there are many growth opportunities to seize. We believe there is still a lot to do. We aim to keep growing fast, while maintaining a two-digit profitability. It is crucial to show our model is really virtuous, whether it be for brands and subscribers, or for us. Premium Beauty News - Is it also an opportunity for brands? Quentin Reygrobellet - We are the only ones to offer such a broad range including 300 brands and selective, niche, parapharmacy products, and of course, natural products, which account for 40% of our turnover. There is no such complete offering in offline channels. We are trying to cover all women’s needs with an affordable, but also premium offering. As a matter of fact, the Splendist box is really doing well: we will soon launch the fourth edition – the winter one. All these innovations have made us a beauty reflex for women. Brands have understood that, so we are getting increasingly popular. Today, the selection of products to be featured in the box is made 10 months ahead: we have countless requests. It used to be one of many channels for brands to grow, and it has become fundamental. Premium Beauty News - Are you considering a global expansion? Quentin Reygrobellet - Definitely. We aim to seize these growth opportunities in France, but also in Europe. Next January, we will launch Blissim in Germany, then in Italy and other European countries, with websites adapted to each country, in their own language, and with the possibility to live the same experiences. Premium Beauty News - How will you promote this new identity? Quentin Reygrobellet - We are lucky enough to be in direct contact with our consumers: through the box, the website, and our CRM. It will be gradual, over the next ten months, but next box in October will obviously bear the name Blissim. We have planned a social media campaign and we have been investing in traditional media with a TV campaign from mid-October to mid-November, as well as in advertizing displays."
"Kenzo Takada, first Japanese designer to conquer Paris fashion, dies aged 81","His death comes 50 years after he launched his first collection in the French capital which he adopted as his home. ""Every wall, every sky and every passer-by helps me build my collections,"" he once said of the city. He retired from fashion in 1999, six years after selling his eponymous fashion brand to luxury conglomerate LVMH, and dedicated his time to one-off projects, including a design collection at the start of this year. Born in 1939 into a family of hoteliers, he chose to study art not catering, becoming a star pupil at Toyko’s Bunka Gakuen Fashion College, where he carried off the top prize. He went on to work for Sanai, a major chain of fashion shops, but dreamed of Paris. The 1964 Olympic Games finally gave him his opportunity to come to Europe. The block of flats in which he was renting an apartment was to be demolished to make way for a stadium. Like all the tenants, he was paid compensation and decided to blow the money on a one-way ticket on a cargo boat to Marseille. Arriving in Paris in the winter of 1965, hardly speaking any French, the only job he could get was in a poodle parlour. In 1970, however, he took the lease of premises in the Galerie Vivienne, then a rather down-at-heel shopping arcade. ""With a few friends for three months we painted the walls with jungle scenes like Le Douanier Rousseau’s Snake Charmer and baptised it Jungle Jap,"" he recalled later. His first show using amateur models to save money was held there. One of the only 20 people invited included the editor-in-chief of Elle magazine who liked the collection so much she ran it on the front cover. He became a name almost overnight. For financial reasons his first collection was made in cotton, often quilted, a look which young fashion leaders took to instantly. But his real impact was with his revolutionary and totally contemporary knitwear, which revitalised the industry. In 1976 he established his studio and boutique in the Place des Victoires. By the time the likes of Rei Kawakuba of Commes des Garcons and Yohji Yamamoto arrived from Japan in the early 1980s, Takada was already well-established on the French fashion scene. His first men’s collection was presented in 1983 and his first perfume, Kenzo Kenzo, in 1988. From the early 1980s boutiques opened all over the world in New York, London, Milan, Toyko and Rome, followed later by Hong Kong, Munich, Venice, Bangkok and Singapore. Kenzo’s romantic style, with its eclectic mix of colour, touches of exoticism, ethnic prints and folksy embroidery, suited the mood of the 1970s but adapted well to the sharper-looking 1980s and 1990s. At the end of the 1980s, Kenzo launched several lines of perfumes, including Kenzo Kenzo in 1988, followed Parfum d’été, Jungle and Flower, the latter of which became a classic and remains a best-seller accross the world.. For inspiration, he drew on his travels as well as Japanese work clothes, such as his favourite military tunics and coats. Peruvian striped blanket throws, colourful shawls, oriental blouses, peasant smocks, printed velvet, were all part of his signature. It was a measure of his success that he was notoriously prey to copyists. British designer Jasper Conran, interviewed on the problem, said he knew of a company in South Africa specialising in ripping off Kenzo, seam for seam. ""They make a fortune - more than Kenzo I reckon - but there’s nothing he can do about it."" He was made chevalier de l’ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 1986 by France in recognition of his career. He tried his hand at film-making with Rêve après Rêve in 1980 and designed costumes for a Stockhausen opera. Apart from travel, his other obsession was gambling. He guarded his privacy by building himself a house in the very heart of Paris, only a few yards from the Bastille opera house, complete with authentic tea pavilion and a pool of carp."
Swedish naturalness in the spotlight with L:A Bruket,"Founded by Monica Kylen and Mats Johansson in Varberg, a spa resort on the West coast of Sweden, near Göteborg, L:A Bruket was born from a Swedish spa heritage perfectly in line with wild nature and its ingredients. Over a hundred face, body, hair, and home references have already made the brand successful in Sweden and beyond, in Scandinavia, a market keen on innovative and clean concepts. “Our philosophy is based on nature-inspired innovation, featuring ingredients mainly derived from Sweden, and a 100% Swedish production,” explains Stanislas Le Bert. To highlight the stability of this ten-year-old approach, the brand’s products are about to get a Cosmos certificate. “It is not a direction we are taking out of the blue. We had the basics, and as a matter of fact, most of our formulas created more than ten years ago do not need to be reviewed. The idea is rather to keep up with a market practice with an interesting tool that guides and informs consumers,” adds the Director. Already distributed in over 500 points of sale across the world, including Liberty in London, Takashimaya and Isetan in Japan, Galleria in Seoul, The Conran Shop, Galeries Lafayette, Champs-Elysées, BHV Marais in France, and Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow’s platform in the US, L:A Bruket aims to develop their partner network, in particular in Europe and Asia. “We are selecting rather than prospecting, just to make sure our brand is where it should be, with the service quality, support, and feedback matching our concept,” explains Stanislas Le Bert. In parallel, the brand is developing its network of wholly-owned stores with two recent openings in Paris, Rue Vielle du Temple and Rue Saint Sulpice, as well as in Berlin. “Now, we have two stores in Sweden, two in Paris, one in Berlin, and one in Tokyo. For us, it is an opportunity to meet customers and understand the brand’s current situation. With these stores, we are going to create positive emotions and make the ephemeral long-lasting in order to, we hope, make these shopping moments stand out. It is the orientation we gave our retail assets and the architectural concept we developed,” adds the Director, who is also reviewing opportunities in London and Korea. It is also an opportunity for the brand to test a new strategy aimed to put forward authentic naturalness before exporting it to Asia and the US. “Our ten years of existence provide us with a heritage with multiple possibilities and many angles from which to work. Today, we would like to further highlight our brand’s clean facet, and the Cosmos certification is part of this strategy. Other innovations in the same vein will follow. In our catalogue, we already have ‘refill’ references, like candles, body and face care products, and we will keep developing this ecoresponsible approach. These are excellent opportunities to innovate and make Mats and Monica’s ten-year philosophy clearer.” The other development areas of this strategy are focused on innovation and e-commerce. “Meaningful product consumption will keep developing. That is the way we see what is next, and we are confident consumer behaviour will gradually change in this direction,” concludes the General Manager."
Le Rouge Français launches new lipsticks with refillable bio-based cases,"Born from the will to preserve the sensorial properties of conventional lipsticks without giving up on the naturalness consumers want, Le Rouge Français was first known for their vegan formulas, made from 100% natural ingredients, including 95% certified organic ingredients, botanical pigments, and using rice wax rather than beeswax to fix pigments. Today a collection of 15 lipstick shades, entirely made from botanical pigments, is available. “We strive to use local raw materials and suppliers. But in some cases we have to source exotic dye plants, so we take care to choose sustainable and labelled crops,” Élodie Carpentier tells Premium Beauty News. The brand is now taking a new step forward by offering a luxurious transparent and refillable case for its lipsticks. Entirely made in an exclusive design from bio-sourced castor oil, the case is fully recyclable. However, it is nevertheless intended for a series multiple reuses, thanks to the brand’s 15 botanical shades available in aluminium eco-refills that are easy to install and replace. ""A very simple mechanism makes it possible to remove the refill from the case and to insert another one with the desired colour before applying it. A single case can therefore be used to accommodate all Le Rouge Français lipstick shades,” explains the brand. The refillable tube will retail for EUR 45 and the refill alone for EUR 26. The primary pack (the case, the refill and the lipstick mechanism) was made by PVL Beauté and the secondary pack (printed folded paperboard) was made by MR Cartonnage Numérique. With the objective of becoming ""the leader in botanical pigment in makeup"", Le Rouge Français is already preparing several new launches (lip care balm, blush, mascara, eyeliner) and wants to accelerate its international development. For this purpose, the company has just raised one million euros, in addition to the take-over of a minority stake by the L’Occitane Group last year, and now has a dedicated sales area at 5 rue Rouget de Lille, in Paris."
Capsum confirms growth ambitions with new Texas plant,"Interrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, the production line assembly in Capsum’s new North-American plant in Austin, Texas, was partly done remotely! “Our technicians and experts were locked down in France, and the machines were already on-site,” explains Sébastien Bardon, CEO of the company specialized in the design and production of innovative skincare and makeup formulas. But virtual reality tools helped deal with hitches and launch the site’s production in early September. Founded in 2008, the company has since earned a reputation as a technological gem in the French cosmetics industry, thanks to the microfluidic technology which revolutionized skincare and, more recently, makeup formulation. “Our technology makes it possible to create very aesthetic, but also exceptionally sensorial products for our customers,” emphasizes Sébastien Bardon. In short, microfluidics helps create a new type of emulsions based on droplets formed one by one, by monitoring their sizes and handling fluids to get the structure desired. Since it was created, Capsum has claimed an average annual growth rate over 50%. “Usually, such growth rates are achieved by high-tech companies, not cosmetics.” Today, the company’s turnover exceeds 50 million euros and is mainly achieved in Europe – a quarter is made in the US. This pace has even hardly been disrupted by the pandemic crisis: Sébastien Bardon foresees a 30% to 40% turnover increase for 2020. The opening of the first North-American production site should help keep up with this pace. The 11,000 m2 site counts 40 employees right now, but it should welcome almost 250 when it is all operational, for an estimated annual production capacity of 250 million units (compared to about 50 million units per year for the French site of Château-Gombert, near Marseille). Starting from scratch, with all the space needed, Capsum was able to create their dream plant in Austin, Texas. “Right from the beginning, we aimed to minimize our environmental footprint by balancing the site’s energy consumption with solar-generated electricity,” explains Sébastien Bardon. Fitted with one of the largest surfaces of solar panels on an industrial site in Texas, the building got a LEED Silver certificate and claims a neutral carbon balance. To limit its water consumption impact, the plant does not use water from drinking or farming water networks: they draw it from salted groundwater (10 g/L, i.e. 1/3 less than sea water) located in-depth under the site. A small desalination installation powered by solar energy makes the water suitable for cosmetics. “American brands already account for a quarter of our business, thanks to our sales offices in NYC and Los Angeles. Time-to-market is a crucial criterion for these customers, so it is a real advantage to have a local production site,” adds the CEO. While the French site is operating at full capacity, the US opening will help Capsum get some leeway in terms of industrial capacities, before opening “a plant just as ambitious as Austin” near Marseille. This seems very likely, given the current growth rate achieved, and it will further optimize production processes and naturalize microfluidic technologies to best keep up with market trends."
Melvita targets “green moms” to strengthen growth,"Created 35 years ago by Bernard Chevilliat to make cosmetic products based on honey from the French Ardèche region, the brand, now part of the L’Occitane group, is the most well-known on the organic cosmetics segment in France and around the world. Its growth reached 21% in 2019. As the organic and natural market is booming, driven by the post-Covid context and consumers’ demand for clean, transparent products, Melvita aims to convert a larger part of increasingly watchful consumers to organic cosmetics. “We aim to make organic products accessible to all and support consumers who buy natural products in choosing organic ones, especially young mothers. The first child often encourages people to turn to organic cosmetics,” says Claire Viano, Melvita’s CEO France and Benelux. 92% of Melvita’s consumers are over 30 and 57% have children. To this aim, Melvita relies on their own basics – Made in France products, expertise in organic formulation, high quality and sensoriality – and strengthens their commitments. Indeed, the brand intends to soon reach excellence in terms of “clean beauty” with irreproachable formulas as regards the skin and the environment. Plus, they have defined different objectives for 2025: 100% excellent notes on Yuka, deciphered INCI lists, and 100% biodegradable rinse-off products. As regards biodiversity, Melvita is speeding up the development of projects focused on biodiversity and bee protection: they have already set up 1,150 hives in France – the objective is to reach 2,000 over the next five years. Lastly, as far as packaging ecodesign is concerned, the brand aims to increase the part of recycled plastic in bottles to reach 100% in 2025, while studying refillable solutions for some of their products. The brand chose to address their main target, “green and committed” moms, through a TV campaign broadcast last June in France, which targeted women aged 35 and over belonging to better-off families. “This campaign made our brand’s fame increase by 7 points,” claims Claire Viano. Another communication wave, this time on the web, will be launched in September and October on social media: YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. To this aim, Melvita has launched a major partnership with two star influencers who are both young mothers: @poi.family and @babychoufamily. This action will be combined with a communication plan in points of sale: the training dimension will also be strengthened by the “organic academy”, a dedicated 12-person team in France. “We want to create the Melvita reflex”, explains International Training Manager Didier Thevenin. Ultimately, a new version of the online store better adapted to mobile phones will be launched. As a reminder, Melvita is present in 15 countries and very well-established in Asia, in particular in Japan, which counts 32 out of the 82 wholly-owned stores around the world. Apart from this store network, Melvita is available through organic distribution channels, pharmacies and parapharmacies, the selective network (Marionnaud…), and others, which makes 3,700 points of sale in France. With already 180 organic-certified product references covering all cosmetics needs, Melvita proves dynamic and innovative. And they will launch new products and ranges over the next six months. The brand is relaunching the line of four toothpaste references with new ecodesigned tubes made of recyclable plastic and has removed the cardboard case to save 3.8 tonnes of cardboard per year. The relaxing Roll-On with lavender essential oil will broaden the Relaxessence range. In November, three new Lip Oils with RedLove apple oil will be launched. Next March, it will be the turn of the firming body balm-oil in the L’Or Rose range. And in April, the new Argan Bio Active face range designed for a real organic lifting effect will be released with two lifting creams, Crème en Huile and Fluide, and two targeted skincare products: a Serum and an Eye Contour."
"“The niche segment message is confused now,” Luc Gabriel, TDC","Premium Beauty News - The Different Company was born with the concept of niche perfumery. What was it meant for back then? Luc Gabriel - When the brand was created, there was no “niche” market, so to speak. There were only perfumer-composer-creators, designers, and a desire to go back to a genuine form of olfactory luxury, since this dimension had almost disappeared the previous decade. In the 2000s, perfumery as a whole had become very popular, and the luxury category was mostly supposed to help make a lot of money on booming markets. Everyone was happy from an economic standpoint, but as regards the olfactory dimension, since the 1970s/80s, things had been more complicated. As our name suggests, The Different Company emerged with the idea of launching an alternative perfumery with a return to basics. First, it was about rediscovering truly exceptional materials worked very differently, or introducing hardly known olfactory elements. Also, it was aimed to offer the possibility to create a perfume without any constraints related to a type of customers or to what was thought to be a market demand. And all this should be showcased in beautiful, specially designed bottles which were already refillable, much before it became a trend. That was the starting point for the brand, and all this remains true now. Premium Beauty News - Back to basics. Does this still characterize niche perfumery? Luc Gabriel - The message has become very confused. Many players associate their own image to niche values, but they do not respect them. To me, the offering changed after the 2008 crisis. New brands emerged, some of which had creative ambitions, while others were more marketing-oriented. The market had grown big enough for brands to position themselves on a given segment. For example, By Kilian was definitely a luxury brand with very high prices. As for L’Atelier Cologne, they entered a category that had clearly been abandoned, and they managed to develop and add value to it. These are two completely different positionings, but both brands were purchased by major groups. As a matter of fact, with the help of very strong investments, they are now available all around the world, in Asia, in Duty Free stores. In both cases, the model defined at the beginning has changed, and it is no longer the same trade, but the terms used do remain the same: “niche perfume” describes completely different products now. It is a message that is difficult to understand for consumers. Premium Beauty News - So, is a niche emerging in the niche segment? Luc Gabriel - There will most probably be a segmentation in the offering of perfume brands, together with a segmentation in the distribution offering. Some niche points of sale offer up to 60 brands, sometimes more. To me, it is antinomical with the very notion of niche. It is just not possible to appropriately advise customers with so much choice. So, the upstream selection done by points of sale will strongly develop. And so will the number of points of sale, with marked specificities meeting the demand of consumers in search for more sophisticated creations. Things will just go back to what niche perfumes were when they emerged in the early 2000s. Premium Beauty News - How has The Different Company evolved over the past 20 years? Luc Gabriel - We have known different phases. A growth phase until 2008, and then there was the crisis: everyone got their fingers burnt. Then, there was a slowdown during which customers were keener on new launches. But, since 2016, we have noticed renewed interest in our fragrances. The market is getting saturated, but our strategy remains coherent. Our bottles have always been refillable, and it is now a strong trend. Everything can be recycled, except for the pump. Customers like that, although we never really communicated about it. We are perceived as an authentic niche brand strongly developing in the whole Asia-Middle East region. Premium Beauty News - What are your projects? Luc Gabriel - We have projects focusing on olfactory products which go beyond the mere bottle and spray combination. We are also working on bases other than alcoholic ones. I am considering all forms possible to use a perfume differently. Premium Beauty News - How do you think the market will evolve? Luc Gabriel - The post-COVID era will make things complicated for many players. This situation will most probably drain the market in terms of purchases, distribution, and brands. It is not necessarily a bad thing."
"With Bath Blend, The Body Shop is banking on the success of upcycling","In a global context of overexploitation of natural resources and while, according to the FAO [1], more than 800 million people suffer from hunger in the world, a third of the food produced globally is wasted. Some of the food is thrown away by consumers themselves [2], but the food industry also discards a significant part of its production, considered as non-compliant with marketing standards. These ""second choice"" fruits and vegetables are the ones that The Body Shop reuses for the formulation of its new range of foaming products for the bath: Bath Blend. ""We have long used ’second choice’ fruits in some of our products,"" explains Débora Gentil, Brand Communications and Training Manager of The Body Shop in Brazil [3], where the new line was launched in July. ""Organic, fair trade banana mash that we have been using for years in our banana shampoo and, now in the form of a bath foam, is made from ’second choice’ bananas or bananas produced by small Ecuadorian farmers, which would not normally be sold for export,"" she adds. The same goes for other damaged fruits and vegetables. ""We are constantly looking to build on this brand legacy, in line with our clients’ growing interest in corporate social responsibility."" With combinations of ingredients like banana and avocado oil or coconut and passion fruit, carrots and mango seed oil, these new bath foams are inspired by smoothies, beverages made with mixed fresh fruits and vegetables. ""We wanted something that went beyond a normal bath foam, that would hydrate and nourish dry skins with natural antioxidants, vitamins and nutrients. At The Body Shop, we are always guided by the benefits provided by natural ingredients, so, for us, a mixture of fruits and vegetables for the bath makes sense,"" emphasizes Débora Gentil. The ingredients are delivered to our labs in the form of oils and extracts, ready to be used safely. Some of them are by-products of the food industry, which have therefore been upcycled. ""The strawberry seed oil used in our bath foam, Berry Bath Blend, is made from the leftover of jellies,"" she explains. ""Cosmetic ingredients of this type help to diversify the outlets of fruit and vegetable suppliers, while ensuring good economic use of the different parts of the food."" According to Débora Gentil, cosmetics based on upcycled food are appreciated by consumers because they are made with ingredients considered noble. ""Since the creation of the brand in 1976, we have been searching the world for the best ethical ingredients, to create beauty products inspired by nature. We hope to continue to find increasingly creative ways to reduce food waste."" Bath foams are packaged in recyclable plastic packaging made from 50% post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic. ""Sustainability is in the DNA of The Body Shop and we hope that with every launch, we can commit ourselves to make the world a better place,"" she concludes."
"“Clean Beauty has revived nail varnish”, Alexandre Miasnik, Fiabila","Premium Beauty News - How did the lockdown period go for Fiabila? Were you able to keep serving your customers around the world? Alexandre Miasnik - The pandemic spread progressively, so all our sites managed to adapt quickly, both internally, to preserve our teams, and from an industrial standpoint, since we aimed to keep producing. Eventually, we were almost able to keep our normal level of activity on all sites, except in India, where all non-essential industries were closed by the government. Premium Beauty News - How are all your different sites doing now? Alexandre Miasnik - Except in India, all sites are working normally. In France, our packaging sites will be very busy over the next few months, as they have been since May. Overall, the other markets are in a much satisfactory situation. Premium Beauty News - How do you think the global nail polish demand will evolve? Alexandre Miasnik - Of course, the Covid-19 pandemic made the global market slow down, since economic activities were partially suspended. But it did not last long. In many countries, beauty salons were closed at least for a short while, but women still took care of themselves at home, so the market remains extremely dynamic. There are adjustments being made in a few regions, but they are mainly related to distribution channels and use habits (salons, mass distribution, selective network, etc.). On many markets, women have also grown aware of the hazards of gel and semi-permanent nail polish, so they are turning their backs on them to buy conventional products which can be very easily applied and removed at home. We believe this positive situation will last, and that safe, compliant formulas will be developed on all markets. Premium Beauty News - In the long term, do you think the nail polish market will enter a significant growth cycle again? Alexandre Miasnik - Definitely. Besides, Euromonitor confirms this, as they forecast a 16% growth in value by 2024. The nail polish market is historically cyclical, and it had picked up again at the beginning of the year. It is a cyclical product, because it competes with other makeup categories and, at least on some markets, it depends on passing fads. But, for a while now, some women have moved away from nail polish, because they have grown wary of it – the chemical industry is viewed negatively. Clean and green beauty, which Fiabila has always promoted, helped reconcile these very demanding consumers with this product. Meanwhile, R&D has been making progress, as products are ever-more efficient, while being perfectly clean and, if needed, featuring ingredients of natural origin. Nail care products are also changing: they are getting more playful and efficient. They have a very high growth potential here. Premium Beauty News - It seems the crisis has also made consumer expectations shift, or strengthened already strong trends, in particular as regards naturalness and CSR. Do you agree? Alexandre Miasnik - Absolutely. Today, nail polish should reach extremely high purity levels, and consumers increasingly expect it to be of natural origin. Also, shoppers pay attention to how nail polish is produced. Over the past few years, Fiabila has invested more than 70 million euros to modernize infrastructures. We are now the only nail polish manufacturer on the main global markets with cutting-edge production sites. Our French plant has even just been rewarded with the Ecovadis Platinum status, which makes us one of the top 1% best-performing sites in terms of environmental protection, out of all the sites audited by this reference body! For example, our plant in Maintenon has acquired a VOC burner to further reduce our carbon footprint, and we have almost finished significant works to automate our colouring solution production lines, as we have already done with bases. In addition, different, shorter channels are getting more popular. The Made in China era, with products containing low-quality or hazardous raw materials shipped all around the world, is no longer a valid model for cosmetics, especially since the cost structure is no longer advantageous. Premium Beauty News - The crisis is likely to have repercussions on the different market players, i.e. both brands and suppliers. Alexandre Miasnik - As far as brands are concerned, the market distribution will undergo many changes – actually, it already did before the crisis. The evolution of consumption patterns is a challenge for all major players facing the competition of very dynamic independent brands. As for nail polish manufacturers, more than ever, Fiabila confirms its leadership on the global and local levels. This is due to our strong investment and innovation policy, but also to our unique philosophy. And we will keep things this way despite the sanitary crisis. On the contrary, other players did not follow the same path, and obviously, a number of them who seemed pretty solid are now in tricky situations and might disappear in the short or medium term."
Is the cosmetics industry sexist?,"Just like in the fashion world, the beauty sector is embodied by women’s faces [1]. Estée Lauder, Helena Rubinstein, Aliza Jabbès, Anick Goutal, Bobbi Brown, Huda Kattann, Rihanna, and many others... Women make decisions and drive trends for many brands. And yet, just like in the fashion world, the industrial part of the chain does not offer this equality. “The beauty world is singular. There are many women, but when you have a look at the top of the pyramid, things are definitely not the same. Women are the bees,” explains Aïmara Coupet, Expert Marketing and Product Development Consultant and founder of the Be+Radiance brand. “At my level, I do not feel it is a handicap. But when I put forward my male shareholders, I do feel it has a reassuring impact. When it comes to managing, a woman does not reassure as much as a man,” she says. Other leaders qualify these observations. “There is actually no equality. In terms of number of Directors, wage gap, mental load... we are not equal,” observes Cosmogen CEO Priscille Caucé. “However, it is an extremely open world, even in industrial companies. It is true that Directors are mostly men, but women and diversity are promoted. It is not a narrow-minded or misogynous world, it is just still very masculine,” she explains. Co-President of Livcer Aude de Livonnière shares the same opinion: “I do not feel I had more difficulties than a man during my career. I am not sure there is a glass ceiling.” The same goes for Isabelle Guyomarch, company Director, President of the CCI Productions Group, and founder of the Ozalys/Cancer Survivor laboratory: “I do not think we can say it is more difficult for a woman. I mean, if you can do what they do, you can do it,” she says, broadening the issue to the position of Director. “Being a company Director usually means working twelve hours a day, plus weekends, sacrificing your private and family life, being able to get away, etc. That is how you build up your career. And what is difficult for a woman is to make all these sacrifices: it is both unnatural and tricky from a societal standpoint, and it is not true for men. Careers and responsibilities are demanding, in terms of time, abnegation, and concerns. You need to be able to handle it all,” adds Isabelle Guyomarch. In an industrial system historically created and directed by men, women still have to make sacrifices they are not necessarily ready to make. And yet, as generations get more flexible with equity, the entrepreneurial model is gradually changing. Still, there is this notion of genre preferences. “I think the industrial world is not appealing at once for women. They tend to prefer creative trades.  Things do change, but the pool of women is much less significant than that of men, because women do not go there because they like it,” believes Aude de Livonnière. “What women want to head an industrial company? That is an interesting question,” confirms Priscille Caucé. In addition, here, like anywhere else, women are allegedly the first victims of their own lack of self-confidence. “To advance the cause, generally speaking, there is action to take on both sides. Men should promote change, and women should dare,” says Priscille Caucé. “Usually, men sell themselves better than women. They dare, they think they are legitimate right from the beginning. On the contrary, women tend to have doubts, to feel they need to prove themselves before they can dare ask for something. It can be a real brake on a career,” says the Director of Livcer. In unison, they confirm that to evolve, the cosmetics industry has everything to gain from a more feminine managerial environment. “Women have this ability to deal with their femininity and maternity, which makes them adopt a different managerial method as a leader – they are often more caring. Barack Obama said that if every State were managed for ten years by a woman, societies would truly change,” says Isabelle Guyomarch, founder – among others – of Ozalys, a dermocosmetics brand dedicated to women with breast cancer. And yet, imposed quotas should not prevail over skill recognition. “It is a risk when it comes to equity. Things can be turned the other way around: sometimes we do not pay enough attention to merit. For example, when Sue Y. Nabi was appointed as the Head of Coty, it was not to make a buzz, as was often said, but because her great skills were acknowledged,” claims Aïmara Coupet. “Parity in board of directors triggered a wave in major companies. It is necessary to have constraints, because things change very slowly. But I do not want a woman’s professional success to be related to an enacted law, it should be due to her abilities and skills,” explains Priscille Caucé. Obviously, the French beauty industry has not really reached diversity yet. “Some people want to, but it is not done yet,” according to Aïmara Coupet. “People wish progress was made, but we are not there yet,” observes Isabelle Guyomarch. “There are reasons to be optimistic, but there is still a long way to go,” says Priscille Caucé. “It is all pretty stereotyped, still,” according to Aude de Livonnière. Without pointing at other responsible factors than the industry’s codes and anchored mentalities on both sides, the leaders we interviewed do wish the situation would change more quickly. But what do men think?"
"“I want to build up the Netflix of Beauty”, Jean-Michel Karam, IEVA","Premium Beauty News - The IEVA group you created has just purchased the L’Atelier du Sourcil network. What are your ambitions? Jean Michel Karam - I am an entrepreneur. After MEMSCAP, which I listed on the Stock Exchange in 2001, I founded IOMA, and then sold it to Unilever in 2012, though I still headed the brand. In 2016, I created the beauty-oriented IEVA startup. To me, there were quite a lot of interesting things to observe. First, the growth of e-commerce raises a lot of questions about the future of offline selling. In fact, I think these two distribution modes will last, but offline distribution will undergo transformations that will depend on the progress of online selling. Secondly, consumers are now quite knowledgeable. They understand that if you do not have real wellness features, beauty features will not be real either. The beauty and wellness transformation has actually taken place. Lastly, the impact of environmental stress on the ageing of physiological parameters, both skin and hair, is far more significant than that of our genetic capital. The creation of IEVA in 2016 was based on all these observations, and we are now working on the comprehensive solution. Premium Beauty News - What are the main steps to build up the IEVA solution? Jean Michel Karam - In 2016, I raised about 3 million euros as part of a first pool to launch the development of part of the solution. It consisted of an application related to a connected jewel which measured the user’s environmental stress to make adapted beauty and nutrition recommendations. This first step took place in June 2019, with a massive deployment in the Marionnaud, Beauty Success, Fnac, Darty networks, and others. Meanwhile, we launched the Elenature hair care range – the first both natural/organic and technical range. It was a powerful launch, so we are now getting new developments ready for this range in 2021. It means that, over six months, we got spectacular results with these launches. Also, I got closer to the IEVA solution as I pictured it in the first place. And here we are, in September 2020: the complete solution is being marketed. Premium Beauty News - What does this new 2020 step consist in? Jean Michel Karam - We took three actions at the same time: a second pool which raised a capital of 17 million euros, we purchased L’Atelier du Sourcil, and we launched the new IEVA application featuring a subscription offering, Mon Moi Beauté. It is free and it works on its own or with the connected jewel to provide a highly accurate skin diagnosis using AI and proprietary dermatological patches. Based on the results, a hair and skincare ritual is suggested in the form of subscriptions and the user gets estimates and advice. They can choose between three subscription formulas, and three days later, they receive two skincare products and one hair care product by one of our brands. We are starting with brands in our ecosystem, IOMA and its sister range M/C for skincare, Elenature for hair care, and L’Atelier du Sourcil for makeup, but we aim to collaborate with other brands. The three subscriptions, L’Expert, L’Essentiel, and L’Unique, are available for €37.90 to €89.90 per month: every month, you receive three products, plus the connected jewel, and personalized skin or hair care products with the most expensive subscription. All subscriptions are non-binding offers, so you can stop any time. You can save up to 70%, it is non-binding, and you get a personalized solution taking into account your physiological characteristics and way of life. The application regularly sends recommendations, in particular top chef recipes with ingredients adapted to your lifestyle, push articles, etc. Premium Beauty News - As part of this strategy, what will be the role of L’Atelier du Sourcil, which is a physical network? Jean Michel Karam - I am mainly focused on a Netflix of Beauty, so choosing offline selling can be surprising, but it should be known that L’Atelier is the leader of eye makeup in France. The 109 stores are not points of sale, but points of experiences. To me, although online selling can cannibalize a big part of offline selling, it will not be able to change experiences and services to the same extent. So, I purchased the undisputed leader of eye makeup, with their very loyal customer base, and in these points of sale I will be able to create points of experiences for IEVA solutions. I do not mean to transform the network into IEVA stores, I just aim to have a point of experience in which the vital community can find a physical post. As soon as early September, the L’Atelier stores will offer the subscription,  which will feature surprises, including makeup products or invitations to Atelier sessions. The L’Atelier range counts 40 references, and the development plan is quite ambitious for next year. We will develop synergies between the two subsidiaries, and the technology provided for L’Atelier will also be massive. There are many innovative solutions to enhance services and solutions as regards personalization according to the face’s morphology. Premium Beauty News - What are your development projects? Jean Michel Karam - Our action will consist in making L’Atelier strongly develop. Today, it represents 109 stores, including 49 wholly-owned stores and 64 franchises, and there are countless requests. In France, we will follow a pace of about ten openings a year, half being franchises. But we will focus even more on developing L’Atelier abroad, so the brand is present globally, in Europe and the US. It is also what I aim to do with the IEVA solution: next step will be the US and China."
"""Any expectations we had for 2020 had to be reassessed,"" says Boticário’s VP","Premium Beauty News - Many of Grupo Boticário’s stores have reopened. What was it like going through months of stores being closed? André Farber - It is still a challenge. In the last few months, we became closer with our partners to help them ease the impact of this crisis. We made our relationship with sales representatives more flexible, eliminated the percentage they paid for marketing contribution and suspended fees. It did not take long until we found new possibilities for catering to our customers, such as with omnichat. The WhatsApp customer service system combines the practicality of a digital platform with a home delivery service, with deliveries made by the store nearest to where the order was placed. Premium Beauty News - The group already has a well-established e-commerce platform [1]. Was the online service important during the pandemic? André Farber - The e-commerce platform is increasingly more relevant for business, but during a time in which shopping was done almost exclusively online, we had to increase our presence on digital channels. We registered an increase in online sales, and 34% of purchases were made by new users. Our app was also used more frequently and 25% of online sales are now done through the app. Premium Beauty News - Unlike during other crises, in this one we did not see the ""lipstick effect"". Is that due to social distancing? André Farber - The radical decrease in socialization was the main reason why we did not see the ""lipstick effect"" in this crisis. At the beginning of the pandemic, people focused on essential items. However, this has begun to change. With beauty salons closed, people began to ""do it themselves"" - buying products to use at home. People began to look for cosmetics and perfumery products which are not too expensive but are valuable in terms of promoting well-being. With all of our efforts, we are already back to the level of demand we had before the crisis. Premium Beauty News - How has the reopening period been, especially while the epidemic in Brazil is still growing? André Farber - From the beginning, we established safety measures across the entire chain and followed the recommendations of local governments in places where we have stores. It was like this when we closed and it is like this while we are reopening. Considering the size of the country, it is only natural that there are a range of different situations. The number of people infected, adherence to social isolation and customer demand are some of the things we are considering in our decision of when to reopen. Even if governments have authorized it, if we don’t feel safe, we will not reopen. Consumer behavior will be different and it is very important that they feel comfortable. Premium Beauty News - Among some of the safety measures you have adopted, one is the virtual makeup test. What other solutions have been planned? André Farber - Suspending in-store tests forced us to look for safe alternatives. For makeup, the recommendation is the virtual mirror. In a simple, fun and accurate way, consumers can try many different lipsticks, with no need to put them on. We continue to think of other technological solutions to transform the shopping experience into something special, even if there is less human contact. Premium Beauty News - O Boticário grew 9% in 2019. With COVID-19, what are the expectations for 2020? André Farber - This unprecedented crisis completely changed the way we think about our business. Any expectations we had for 2020 had to be reassessed. We are working hard on safety and increasing consumer options in order to maintain a level of growth this year. It is hard, but we will do whatever it takes to make it happen."
Maison Sybarite is riding the green trend with water-based fragrances,"By launching a new generation of water-based perfumes, the two founders of Maison Sybarite wanted to propose innovative fragrances that respected nature. A whole new philosophy involving like-minded partners. The name Sybarite was inspired by the Greek colony which settled in Calabria, in the 8th century BC. In line with the measured pursuit of pleasures associated with self-indulgence, Maison Sybarite claims to be a community of knowledgeable enthusiasts in the field of olfactory sensoriality. To create these ethanol-free fragrances, Maison Sybarite opted for the microemulsion technology (oil-in-water) developed by the Laboratoire AR2i. ""We wanted to go further, and thus propose perfumes with exceptional longevity,"" explained the founders of the brand. This is why formulas have a high concentration of aromatic compounds, which provide its intensity to the fragrance on the skin. Hence the ultradrops® - 160nm micro-drops - in the emulsion allow increasing the perfume’s persistence. The micro-emulsion induces a real ""symbiosis"" between the perfume and the skin. A process which, according to the brand, guarantees a unique sensory experience. To achieve this, Maison Sybarite used a specific pump with wide diffusion. What’s more, the texture is non-oily, non-sticky and contains no chemical solvents. A solution that recalls the soft liquid perfumes of Sabé Masson or the molecular perfumes of Hermetica. For the perfumer, this technology represents a new challenge in the development of the formula. ""It’s a real exercise because the stability is not the same. I learn as I go! In the end, I formulate with higher concentrations for an impacting and lasting result,"" explained the independent perfumer Antoine Lie, who created three of the four fragrances in the Collection (Bed of roses, 720 and Opulent Wood), while Spicy Calabria was devised by Laure Santantoni, a perfumer at Argeville. At a time when the craze for natural cosmetics has now also set foot in the perfume category, choosing an alternative to alcohol could not stand as the only response to new consumer expectations. The two founders sought inspiration from the balanced lifestyle of Sybarites, combining a moderate search for sensory pleasures and productivity, with a concern for harmony with nature. The glass bottle produced by Steklarna Hrastnik and the secondary packaging (BES in Grignan) are made from materials and processes, selected to underpin the brand’s ecological commitment. The secondary packaging is olive green, a nod to nature and the Mediterranean world, with hot stamping and a gold logo. ""To deliver on our ecological commitment, we opted for an ecologically produced cardboard, which preserves forest resources,"" stipulated the creators. As for the bottle, its shape is reminiscent of Ancient Greece, and its purple colour recalls the colour that the Sybarites wore until they reached adulthood."
Henkel expands in digital D2C with Invincible Brands Holding acquisition,"The transaction comprises three direct-to-consumer brands: HelloBody, Banana Beauty and Mermaid+Me, which are mostly sold in Europe. The three brands offer premium beauty care products and they also address the growing trend of sustainable and clean beauty. HelloBody is active in the skin, body and hair care categories, Mermaid+Me focuses on hair care products. Banana Beauty offers decorative cosmetics such as lipsticks and eyeliners. In the last twelve months as of June 2020, the businesses generated total sales of around 100 million euros and employed around 180 people, including an experienced incubator team with a strong track record of launching new D2C brands. The three D2C brands capture more than 1.5 million active consumers and should significantly strengthen Henkel Beauty Care’s digital footprint. “With this acquisition we will strengthen our portfolio with fast-growing premium brands in attractive categories. Through 1:1 interactions with consumers we will gain valuable insights that will help us to create meaningful innovations for the entire retail business,” said Jens-Martin Schwärzler, Executive Vice President and responsible for Henkel’s Beauty Care business. The remaining 25 percent stake in the business will stay with the founders of Invincible Brands Holding - Bjoern Keune and Gennadi Tschernow - and private equity fund manager capital D. The founders and existing management team will remain onboard to further expand the existing as well as establishing new businesses. The agreement, the financial terms of which were not disclosed, is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals."
Symrise inaugurates a fragrance oasis in the heart of Paris,"Located at 12 rue de Presbourg, in Paris, L’Appartement Étoile offers an intimate and inviting ambiance as well as a breathtaking view of the Arc de Triomphe. Upon entering, the visitor is transported in the very specific mood of the venue, which mixes business and art. The entrance hall is decorated with an old alembic transformed into a contemporary work of art by French urban artist Skio. Franco-Israeli interior designer Deborah Prasquier created the new space taking inspiration from the traditional Haussmannian style and Parisian chic while offering perfectly functional spaces, integrating not only meeting areas but also a true and fully operational fragrance creation laboratory. ""L’Appartment Étoile, through its conception, design and overall ethos, embodies the Symrise values of excellence, creativity and added value,” said Heinz-Jürgen Bertram, CEO Symrise AG. “Symrise Fine Fragrance consistently challenges existing ways of thinking and I am confident that this new hub will continue the Symrise expansion and reinvention of the fine fragrance category.” Beyond fragrance creation, the new hub will also be used to support creative arts and olfactory culture, thus creating a bridge between various areas thanks to a series of exclusive cultural events, including thematic exhibitions, master classes, conversations with iconic speakers and artists to learn, connect and cross-pollinate knowledge. The opening ceremony of L’Appartement Étoile took place on July 22, 2020. The event featured a classical music concert and the creation of an exclusive fragrance by Symrise’s team of perfumers in Paris: Maurice Roucel, Annick Ménardo, Émilie Coppermann, Alienor Massenet, Pierre-Constantin Guéros, Alexandra Carlin, Marine Ipert and Suzy Le Helley. “It is in the Symrise DNA to challenge boundaries - we constantly push ourselves to create differently, with more agility and ingenuity,” said Ricardo Omori, senior vice president global fine fragrance, Symrise AG. “We also believe fragrance inspiration is cultivated through collaboration with other artistic disciplines. L’Appartement Étoile Symrise brings together these ideals of imagination and collaboration in an avant-garde space to spark ideas, create opportunities and bring thoroughly modern fragrance solutions for our clients.” This new hub participates in Symrise’s strategy to strengthen its Fine Fragrance business. Recently, the group recruited three young perfumers, several confirmed evaluators, and reinforced its sales team with the appointment of Ivan Bagnis. Symrise also invested heavily in the sourcing of new raw materials and the development of new extraction technologies."
Cosmo Fragrances unveils creation flat in Paris,"Premium Beauty News - Can you tell us more about this “flat”? Alexandrine Demachy - We set up a small team to provide our commercial branch with a creative centre. The high point was the recruitment of our own perfumer, Céline Perdriel, during lockdown. This project results from our will to offer our customers a breath of fresh air: a place to meet people, exchange, and cross-fertilize right in the heart of Paris. It is a beautiful, calm flat located Place Victor Hugo, within walking distance from the mythical avenue of the Champs- Élysées, so dear to our foreign customers. This way, we will be able to sound the city out and enhance our creativity. As a matter of fact, to create beautiful things, you need to be in a beautiful place – hence the choice of this glamorous, smart address which will help develop privileged relationships with our customers. Premium Beauty News - Cosmo Fragrances is already in the United States and Spain. What are your business strategies in France? Alexandrine Demachy - Cosmo Fragrances is a family company whose headquarters are actually located in Florida and are completed with two commercial antennas in NYC and Los Angeles. We are also present in Barcelona. This global dimension is now broadened with a creative centre in Paris, the perfume city par excellence. But perfume is also Grasse, in the south of France – our research centre is situated in this region, in Mougins. Vanessa Lecomte - Our approach is based on an intimate, trust relationship with our customers, in line with the family and independent soul of our company. Our President, Marc Blaison, is also a perfumer, which makes our approach more creative. We want to take our time to create using our complete expertise: perfumer, assessor, laboratory, the whole being served by the cutting-edge technologies of our centre in Mougins. Our strength lies in our ability to meet our local customers’ expectations, as they are abandoned by major groups who have absorbed smaller companies. We have a role to play: offering both giants’ expertise and the flexibility and warmth of a small team that can develop tailor-made perfumes. Having a creation centre in Paris is also a luxury, since medium-sized structures are now quite rare in the capital city. We want this know-how to be available to fine and high-end perfumes, but also home fragrances, which recently embraced the codes of luxury perfumery. Premium Beauty News - This year was marked by the arrival of a house perfumer. Céline Perdriel, could you tell us about your background? Céline Perdriel - I worked in various structures, so I have a broad vision of creation. First, I worked at Synarome, which offered me a beautiful experience of raw materials, chromatography and formulation. Then, I joined Givaudan, where my main customers were L’Oréal’s luxury brands. It was very formative and demanding: I improved my work’s creativity as part of a two-person team with 16 different perfumers – and as many methods. Lastly, in order to get closer to Grasse and natural materials, I worked at Azur Fragrances. It was an opportunity to add body care expertise to my “fine” experience. Thanks to this multifaceted background, I gradually got familiar with different markets (the US, Europe, Germany, South America). Alexandrine Demachy’s proposal was appealing due to the company’s human-sized potential in line with what I aspired to. I like the vision of this group, because it is supported by meaningful organization and investments. It is a vision of beautiful perfumery in a very human environment, with a stimulating potential of varied markets and projects. Alexandrine Demachy - Céline’s broad expertise, cross-disciplinary approach and propensity to be into everything are much precious to our strategy, which consists in creating diverse products with the same glamour and quality criteria. It guarantees a signature recognizable in all our creations. Contrary to a big company structured with divisions, we favour a customized approach that can fit all projects. Céline’s dynamic personality is also valuable for all the challenges we take up, and it is in line with the energy of the women’s trio we form with Vanessa Lecomte. This synergy is crucial, because Cosmo Fragrances is a family company whose early employees are still there, but also because we need to establish long-term relationships with our customers. Premium Beauty News - Can you tell us more about the research centre in Mougins? Alexandrine Demachy - In 2012, we purchased a research centre near Grasse for extraction and distillation purposes. Our cutting-edge equipment offers beautiful, qualitative natural materials, like our Timur Pepper or Maté, thanks to green processes like “craftivity” or molecular distillation, in order to be as respectful of plants as possible. Cosmo selects green technologies that do not require petrochemical solvents. Everything is devised as part of an ecoresponsible approach - a real philosophy in our company. Premium Beauty News - What are your projects? Alexandrine Demachy - We have been working on trends and collections based on themes like Pantone 2020 Classic Blue or Rebirth, in relation to post-lockdown. And from a more general standpoint, as part of our commercial strategy, we will bring our development centre in Spain back to the heart of Barcelona: the inauguration will take place in September. It will be an opportunity to unveil our new communication strategy and logo. Premium Beauty News - What is your vision of the market? Alexandrine Demachy - Lockdown reinforced the public’s expectations in terms of reasonable and responsible consumption. Brands will have to adapt to this new situation by reinventing the pleasure of buying with meaningful products that can seduce consumers in every possible way. We will need to reconcile the notions of dream, glamour and ecology with beautiful refillable bottles, for example. But perfume exhales a part of magic which will always be fascinating, because, as could be seen during lockdown, there is still a way to do yourself good and escape. It is a reassuring, caring value that is precious in these uncertain times."
Arcancil recruits new suppliers for the post-Covid-19 era,"Taking advantage of the reflection period due to the slowdown related to the COVID crisis, CEO Anne Delleur Cabarrus launched a brand performance analysis covering the last months of 2019 and early 2020. “The analysis highlighted a considerable loss of turnover due to our operations despite the investments made since 2016 as part of a high-performing SAP Business One system of information. We found that we could not handle a number of firm orders because some of our suppliers did not deliver on time or did not have reliable stocks, or there was progress to be made in terms of communication. It was the right moment to re-examine it all, so we could count on safe operations in the future,” she explains. As an ‘Excellence’ BPI France member, the company was granted the support of two consultants appointed by the French organization, Lysiane Bessonnet and Christine Le Guennec. The mission consisted in listing all the suppliers that were not part of the brand’s active partners and who satisfied determined criteria. “Our selection criteria are very precise. The companies need to be able to get organic, Cosmos certifications to develop clean, organic makeup and skincare products as soon as 2021, whether their size is adapted to ours or not, and whether they have a family profile or are directly related to the shareholder. We also ask for information about the production chains and technologies, and require that the whole production be managed internally. Lastly, it is important for us that their structures be digitalized and that they have efficient information systems to communicate quickly,” adds Anne Delleur Cabarrus. About a hundred 90% French companies were selected as part of this first screening; they are answering the RFI (Request for Information) questionnaire set up according to the criteria. “Based on this selection and on videoconferences with these companies’ General Managers, we will make a choice in late July to find our three to five partners for the next five years. Any entity that thinks they correspond to the profile and has not been contacted can still fill in the questionnaire by writing to Lucile Froment, who is in charge of the sourcing [1]” adds the President. The market situation as a transformation driver “The current situation shows we need to make transformations even more quickly,” she continues. “Today, we require much flexibility, agility, and fast development for smaller quantities and with much transparency and sincerity in our exchanges. We need to quickly adapt to the market and optimize our own internal resources. It is essential in the current context, so we need to change our processes, and other people should be able to question themselves and change too.” Launched as part of an exclusive partnership with Monoprix a year ago, the clean, vegan range Le Lab Végétal by Arcancil Paris became available in 60 additional stores last June, which makes 108 stores, all in all. This acceleration illustrates the brand’s commitment to systematically making “green” products for the past two years. “It is also in this context of accelerated deployment with Monoprix, Arcancil Paris’s historic partner, that we needed to find partners perfectly familiar with this field. We want to focus makeup innovation on this, so we need to select partners that are better informed as regards the clean and vegan criterion, and more precisely formula/packaging,” concludes Anne Delleur Cabarrus."
"Beauty salons finally re-open in the UK, with restrictions","Managing the re-opening of the British economy meant phasing out the ease of the lockdown into three steps. The first phase has seen non-essential workers going back to work (construction industry for instance). In the second phase primary schools re-opened and non-essential retailers were allowed to trade from the 15th of June. And in the third phase, starting Saturday 4th July, the Prime Minister announced that pubs, restaurants and hairdressers were be able to reopen. However, beauty salons were still prohibited to welcome back customers. After an agonising wait for salon owners, the British government eventually allowed nail bars, spas and beauticians to go back into business as of July 13th, but some treatments will NOT be permitted such as: – Face waxing, sugaring or threading services;
– Facial treatments;
– Advanced facial technical (electrical or mechanical);
– Eyelash treatments;
– Make-up application;
– Dermarolling;
– Dermaplaning;
– Microblading;
– Electrolysis on the face;
– Eyebrow treatments. [1] The UK government emphasises that treatments or services provided in the ‘high risk zone’ directly in front of the client’s face are the most risky in terms of catching or spreading the virus. The British Beauty Council has been campaigning for the re-opening and has released a series of content to help the beauty industry during the lockdown, including the CTPA guidance’s for in-store testers and cosmetic counters, a webinar explaining the latest guidelines for salon owners, but also a Template letter to send to local MP for the Reopening of the Beauty, Spa and Wellness Industry. “The decision to broaden the scope of available hair and beauty services will allow many more beauty professionals to get back to work and will also allow customers to benefit from a range of beauty treatments which can be carried out safely for both client and practitioner. It’s a positive step, but we are still only part of the way there. We will keep working closely with governing bodies and supporting everyone in beauty until we are able to achieve the fully-reinvigorated beauty industry we all want,” says, Millie Kendall MBE, CEO of the British Beauty Council. The beauty industry brings a £28.4 to the British GDP, and 590 500 jobs which equates to ONE in every 60 jobs in the UK economy [2] and the British Beauty Council hope that the contribution of beauty to the overall re-dynamisation of the economy will be very positive."
"Floratropia, the startup revolutionizing the perfume world","Launched in January 2020 after two years of development and a crowdfunding campaign started in October 2019, the young brand surprised everyone with radical choices marking a complete break from the perfume world’s customs. After exactly six months of existence and an exclusive online presence, Floratropia will make their debut at the Paris BHV Marais department store next July. And yet, its creator, Karine Torrent, is from a perfume background. “Perfume became a passion very early on. I occupied marketing and development positions with people who loved raw materials, and professionally, I evolved with the idea that what actually makes a beautiful perfume is beautiful raw materials,” she explains. After training at Guerlain and Yves Rocher, she joined the Puig group before turning to niche perfumery. “All this made me wonder about the model of modern perfumery and think about how to integrate it to a model with a positive impact on the planet, the biodiversity of perfume plants, and the communities that cultivate them,” she recalls. Floratropia has the ambition to question established truths in the world of perfume. “The project consisted in methodically deconstructing and questioning every product development phase, from raw material sourcing to packaging design,” continues Karine Torrent. The objective was to relate the perfumer’s know-how to sustainable development objectives. The idea of a 100% natural and vegan perfume is nothing new – it is even a major trend in the current perfume landscape. And the industry’s giants have understood that perfectly well: they are all trying to enhance their portfolio of natural ingredients through multiple acquisitions. And yet, people were extremely cautious with the idea of a completely plant-derived creation based on responsible networks. “We even had a lot of very negative feedback,” emphasizes the creator. “There is this firmly anchored conviction that a beautiful perfume cannot be completely natural. Fortunately, lines are shifting thanks to new brands’ obstinacy, as can be seen with 100Bon, who have been working very hard on this issue.” The encounter with perfumer Delphine Thierry was eventually a triggering factor. “She showed me it was possible to make both 100% natural and exceptional perfumes.” The four Floratropia perfumes are based on Robertet’s portfolio of natural raw materials, with a few beautiful innovations, like the use of Hedychium, whose culture in Madagascar offers farmers complementary revenue. “The choice of raw materials is both artistic and ethical,” highlights Karine Torrent. “We wanted perfumes that grow in the earth to provide perfume plants and growers with a prospect.” Floratropia also asserts their identity with a packaging choice which breaks with the current perfume codes. Perfumes are no longer sold in luxurious bottles to be thrown away when the product is empty, but in flexible refills which feed a travel size spray decorated with a vegan leather imitation sold separately. Plus, nothing prevents the consumer from using their own spray if they already have one! “It is the best solution as regards the carbon footprint throughout the value chain. Our aluminium, PET, and PE ‘Resources’ consume very few materials and are very energy-efficient; they are light and do not require any overpackaging. Of course, they are not perfect, in particular because they are not recyclable. That is why we invite our customers to send them back to us for free, so that we can manage their end-of-lives as part of a partnership with a German recycling player,” explains the creator. Not only this solution helps reduce the impact of packaging, but it also makes the product more affordable. “When you buy a perfume, you also buy a lot of packaging. By changing things in terms of packs, we also change the environmental and the economic equations. Natural perfumes are costly, but our packaging solution helps focus the product’s value on perfume, by reducing waste and carbon emissions. In short, we offer more perfume for less packaging.” As Floratropia is about to enter the physical distribution channel, the brand is also considering the possibility of providing refills in stores. Launched just before the Covid-19 pandemic, Floratropia aims to provide an answer to several questions regarding contemporary consumption patterns. “Fast fashion is much criticized, but the current model of fast perfumes is not neutral either, with its furious launch pace combined with a standardization of the offering, even though the overall impacts cannot be compared,” concludes Karine Torrent. Well, welcome to the world of slow perfumery!"
"900.care, a new concept of refillable products for the bathroom","900 corresponds to the average number of seconds spent in the bathroom, i.e. 15 mn, and Care refers to the will to do oneself good without causing harm to the environment. Aymeric and Thomas, the two young co-founders of 900.care, started working in the bathroom, as they noticed the circle of consumption was far from virtuous. “We throw away our empty bottles to purchase exactly the same ones, only full. It is an absurd system, so we wanted to find a solution with containers to be kept for a long time, and which could be refilled with a formula without any compromise on the comfort and sensoriality of a standard product,” explains Aymeric Grange. Both uncluttered and neutral, these containers do not sport any brand sign. “The logo is concealed and the product information is available on the cardboard packaging of the refill. When you buy a lamp, you don’t want it to display the logo. Same principle here,” adds the creator. The choice of partly recycled plastic for these packs is in line with the brand’s commitment. “We made this choice of material for three reasons. For an object you will keep for a long time, plastic is a good solution, provided you do not create new packs too regularly. Thanks to recycling, you give the existing plastic a second life. It is also pretty energy-efficient as regards manufacturing, and it is lighter to transport than glass or aluminium. The CO2 impact is weaker.” The containers are designed by Romain Lemahieu and manufactured by VPI and Qualiform, two French recycled plastic specialists. They can be washed between two refills, and if they get damaged, the packaging is replaced by the brand: they have it recycled. The 900.care concept is intended for consumers – and there are more and more of them – who prefer clean solutions, but do not want to change their expectations as regards product comfort. It is supposed to be both easy and convenient. “We do not mean to make people feel guilty; we prefer to encourage them. We aim to make zero waste accessible, i.e. to offer a beautiful customer experience and make it all easy. Our concept is intended for those we call ‘imperfect eco-warriors’”, explains Aymeric Grange. The formulas developed and manufactured in France are based on 95% natural ingredients and the specifications are focused on sensoriality and efficacy. The startup launched a 30-day fundraising campaign on Ulule to finance the first production. Contributors will receive their products in November, when the e-shop is launched. Shoppers will be able to purchase single products (€7.5 for a container, €5.5 for a refill) or take out a subscription. By 2021, they aim to join a retail network and gradually broaden their range to all bathroom essentials."
KDC/One to refocus their industrial operations in Europe,"Following a review of the company’s operational, project management and commercial teams across Europe, Canada-based cosmetics supplier KDC/One has announced its intention to relocate some of its operations, potentially leading to the closure of the several sites in France and the UK. Indeed, KDC/One plans to consolidate some of its production lines in its most competitive facilities in order to create centres of excellence that “will provide a strong platform for sustainable growth in the future.” With the acquisition of the Alkos Group and Swallowfiled last year, KDC/One took control of three production sites in France (Inter Cosmétiques, Sagal Cosmétiques and Alkos Cosmétiques) and two sites in the United Kingdom (in Wellington, Somerset, and Bideford, North Devon), plus another industrial facility in Tabor, Czech Republic. The restructuring plan will result in the pencil and soap manufacturing being transferred from the existing Swallowfield Bideford and Sagal Cosmétiques sites to the state-of-the-art Alkos Cosmétiques facility in Hesdin-l’Abbé, in Northern France, closed to Boulogne-sur-Mer. The transfer would involve investing in a new cutting-edge production line for soaps at the site. In addition, deo sticks manufactured by Sagal Cosmétiques in Gallardon and the skin care and lip care products made by Swallowfield in Bideford will go across to Inter Cosmétiques KDC/One’s plant in Angers in Western France, which was inaugurated in June 2018. The changes are likely to lead to the closure of the Sagal Cosmétique and Bideford facilities. In addition, some employees are at risk of redundancy at the company’s sites in Wellington, Somerset, and Paris, due to the reorganization in sales operations. “This strategic review of our European businesses has been underway since last November. While these decisions have not been easy ones, they are necessary to move the businesses forward, allowing us to maximise production capabilities, continuously innovate and meet customer expectations in a highly demanding and competitive marketplace,” said KDC/One Europe President Matthew Gazzard.  “We will be working closely with work representatives to ensure all our employees have access to the support they need during this time,” he added. Eventually, KDC/One stressed that this refocussing of the company’s operations is in no way a response to the COVID-19 pandemic or to Brexit. “We had been strategically reviewing the business structure for many months following our acquisitions in Europe last year before the pandemic arose, albeit the events of recent months requires the company, as with all businesses, to build additional resilience into its operational model,” highlights Matthew Gazzard. Consultations will soon commence with employees at risk of redundancy in France and in the UK."
Cosmetics Europe explores the importance of cosmetics in daily life,"With an emphasis on sustainability, product safety and wellbeing, the ‘Essentials for Daily Life’ series brings into focus the sometimes overlooked ways in which the cosmetics sector enhances the lives of consumers on a daily basis. It offers a behind- the-scenes look at the cosmetics and personal care sector, exploring what it is doing to enhance people’s lives, support the planet and improve products. “It is a unique opportunity to showcase aspects of our industry which are not widely known or understood. The stories in the series give a real insight into our innovative and forward-looking industry. I would like to thank the partner companies and associations who have made this amazing journey possible,” said John Chave, Director General of Cosmetics Europe. The video series is intended to inform audiences of the key trends and developments in the highly complex and continually evolving cosmetics sector, challenging misconceptions, and developing a better understanding of the scale and economic impact that cosmetics have across the continent. Developed in partnership with Apivita, Beauté Pacifique, Henkel, IKW, Ilcsi, Inuacare, Ivatherm, Kao, Kemon, L’Occitane, L’Oréal, Laponie, NAOS, Orkla, Pierre Fabre, Procter and Gamble, Symrise, Unilever and Weleda, the series can be seen on the ‘Essentials for Daily Life’ website since the 11th of June and will be promoted on social networks. Among the various videos presented, the documentary ""The Refill Revolution"" shows how Kao has revolutionized the Japanese household and personal care market with its refill packs that have reduced the amount of plastic used in these categories by more than 70% versus a do-nothing scenario. In 1991, the company introduced a refill packaging system that serves both the environment as well as the consumer. The refill pouches are produced with a thin plastic film that significantly reduces the amount of plastic needed and enables consumers to use up even the last drop of product. ""We have been able to convert 80% of all packages purchased in the household and personal care categories here in Japan to these thin film refillable packages,"" points out Dave Muenz, Senior Vice President ESG (Environnement, Social, Gouvernance) at Kao. ""That has resulted in a 74% reduction in the sheer amount of plastic that is used in those categories."" The Kao film, along with the other videos in ""Essentials For Daily Life"" series, might contribute to offer an alternative vision on the cosmetics industry."
"“Our industry is based on contact,” Laurent Mercier, Eurofragance","Premium Beauty News - How has the crisis impacted your business? Laurent Mercier - In 2018, the whole industry had to deal with an unprecedented raw material crisis. It was a tough economic year, but it all got better in 2019 and we kept growing, geographically speaking. The year 2020 had started very well: the first quarter was the best we had had since the company was founded. And then the pandemic created the biggest problem for any company: mobility. Whether in B2B or B2C, our whole industry is based on us offering an experience. With our customers, we need to reinvent contact with a new parameter then: that of reduced mobility. It is an emotion transfer chain we must pass from one person to another, and now this bond is all gone. Perfume sales are struggling, and the duty free market is seriously impacted. It is going to take several months until everyone flies again. Things will not come back to normal before two years. And yet, do we feel like travelling like we did before? We are only getting out of the health crisis and entering an economic crisis with an underlying societal crisis. People will question things. Premium Beauty News - What are the most affected sectors? Laurent Mercier - Our activity is mainly related to Fine Fragrance, and then Body and Home Care. As regards perfumes, I think there will always be a place for beautiful and expensive things. Anything that is somewhat exclusive and related to a niche has a chance to be more visible. Well-established brands can now seduce consumers who used to buy products that were a little less expensive, but are now more available or just feel like spending money for pleasure. But price is quite significant for everything that does not really stand out. Niche winners will also be those that invest in private networks, like Puig, with Penhaligon’s, or L’Artisan Parfumeur. The category that will undergo more changes should be Body Care, because solid cosmetics are making a comeback. Plus, we bank on Home Fragrance: people have rediscovered their homes, so they will feel like enhancing them with beautiful perfuming products. Premium Beauty News - What about the natural perfume trend? Laurent Mercier - Last year, with Marketing and Communication Director Stéphanie Marze, we organized the #GreenIsEasy event to help our customers find their way in this field. About sixty manufacturers took part in it and they had many questions to ask. The idea was also to explain that nature for the sake of Nature can be more of a curse than a blessing. Many conventional fragrances are much more valuable than natural fragrances in terms of carbon footprint, if you make a comparison throughout the value chain. For now it is difficult for the industry to make all-natural products that are actually environmentally friendly. It takes time to achieve a transition. We provided explanations about the situations on the market and the packaging segment, but the main issue was regulations and certification. We need to support customers appropriately, because they are really eager to learn about naturalness, especially after the pandemic. Eurofragance keeps working on this with a palette of perfumers which is evolving and needs to be further enhanced. Our industry has understood that we need to explain what “real” naturalness is, because this word conceals a lot of issues and imperfections. Plus, unfortunately, it is often used to the detriment of “synthetic”, whereas biodiversity-wise, these concepts are complementary. This duty of transparency is dear to us, both for our customers and consumers. It is one of our main missions for the years to come."
"A new website, a new design, new features…","This new version of the Premium Beauty News site is the third major update since its launch in 2008. The challenge was to incorporate a host of new features while maintaining the news readability and an utmost browsing and reading comfort, while offering readers easier access to the huge amount of information available today on the site (nearly 17,000 articles in free access). General navigation has evolved to offer a dual entry menu: the thematic navigation (markets, trends, R&D, packaging, ingredients, regulations, innovations, etc.) is maintained and is now coupled with the possibility to select the geographic area (Europe, Middle East, North America, Asia...), thus offering a unique 360° picture of the global beauty industry. We are multilingual by nature, with a version in English and another in French from the start, and since 2014 a Brazilian edition in Portuguese (the transition of Brazil Beauty News to the new version is underway). The English version is now visited by more than 60% of our reader base, thus offering our advertisers worldwide reach (North America, United Kingdom, Asia and the Middle East representing the main groups of English readers). As for the French version, it guarantees first-hand information on French brands and suppliers, whose weight in the global cosmetics industry cannot be denied. We want to continue our global expansion with a dedicated content by market and continent. And soon, with a new edition, which will further enhance the visibility of our partners and the quality of the information brought to our readers. Navigation on the new site has been further improved and made even more easier, with an augmented visual path, suited to a higher graphic resolution. This enhanced presentation now allows us to offer our advertisers, more space and visibility on banners but also on new formats, while preserving the ease of browsing and readability for visitors. The site now features a section dedicated to multimedia content (video, podcast), which is easier to access and more visible, but also a section dedicated to the innovations of our suppliers for highlighted editorial contents. This model allows companies in the industry to consolidate their notoriety and to actively communicate on their novelties. It also allows us to offer our readers a 100% free quality content. We would like to thank these advertisers for their unwavering support from the start. The website’s search engine has been improved to allow you to narrow down your selection criteria. Search results for archived articles always appear according to relevance criteria (according to the rank of the word(s) searched for in the article). The query can now be filtered by language or sorted chronologically. One of the main assets of Premium Beauty News lies in its freely available archives. With nearly 12 years of presence and a considerable amount of news material indexed by the main search engines, Premium Beauty News is today one of the main multi language reference in the industry. This change in design is a first step in the stepping up of our services, new features will be introduced in the course of 2020 and beyond. We wish to also take this opportunity to thank our readers and our advertisers for their loyalty and unwavering support since the very start; our sole commitment is to continue supporting them by staying by their side, especially with the complex times looming ahead! We are here to help with: – Promoting and/or hosting your webinar to educate or introduce your innovations;
– Publishing your news and announcements;
– Increasing your notoriety in the beauty industry. So please do not hesitate to contact us!"
"“IL Cosmetics aims to keep diversifying activities,” Jean-François Harpès","Premium Beauty News - The Covid-19 pandemic is an unprecedented crisis. How did IL Cosmetics react? Jean-François Harpès - I am surprised at our countries’ absence of preparation for a crisis that started in December in China. Our governments did not take advantage of the two or three months before the epidemic spread outside Asia to take the best-adapted preventive measures. As a matter of fact, Taiwan’s example shows the efficacy of an early, adequate reaction. As far as IL Cosmetics is concerned, our contacts with our Asian customers and suppliers helped us anticipate the risk earlier and get ready. Our priority was to protect our employees. Starting from mid-March, we implemented a whole series of preventive measures: quarantine, working from home everywhere possible, temperature checking, importation of masks directly from China, spacings and protective separations between the different workstations, reinforced disinfection and hygiene procedures, detection of Covid traces… Thanks to our teams’ motivation and dedication, all these measures were implemented in record time in our bulk and packaging plants, laboratories and offices. It helped us prevent people from being contaminated on our premises and keep working without any interruption. Premium Beauty News - IL Cosmetics also contributed to fighting against the epidemic. Jean-François Harpès - We made hand sanitizers for hospitals in Luxembourg. We had alcohol stocks available, which was an advantage. And like other companies in our sector, we adapted our chains to respond to the emergency situation. Premium Beauty News - What is the current situation at the different IL Cosmetics sites? Jean-François Harpès - We remained operational throughout the lockdown period in our three plants, in Luxembourg, Poland, and Bulgaria. Only our R&D division was impacted, in particular because we had to reorganize the tests with our consumer panels, so they could be carried out at people’s homes. Premium Beauty News - What do you think the economic situation will be like in the short term? Jean-François Harpès - If our production capacities were not impacted, obviously demand was, due to many points of sale closing. The orders delivered were stored by brands, so now the products need to be sold. But the missed consumption opportunities will not be made up for and we will not get the consumption months lost back. As a result, we are anticipating a business slowdown. Based on our exchanges with our customers, we can expect a market downturn of -10% to -20% in 2020. But I think we will get back to the same consumption level as before the crisis as soon as 2021. We are lucky because we are very strong in relatively less impacted areas. In Germany, the Netherlands, and in several countries in the North of Europe, distribution was not completely interrupted. Likewise, Asia represents a significant part of our sales, and the crisis was less violent in China, Japan, and South Korea. IL Cosmetics is doing very well. We had implemented significant streamlining measures which have already brought positive results, and we had foreseen a very high growth rate for 2020. In the end, we will probably achieve a stable turnover: given the circumstances, it will be a great result and a real advantage. Premium Beauty News - How will the pandemic impact the different makeup categories? Jean-François Harpès - The first statistics we got from the distributors that remained open during the crisis confirm the fact that the nail and eye categories are on the rise, while lip and face products have declined. This trend should keep developing, since the latter are less adapted to mask wearing. A crisis is also a powerful innovation driver! To meet new needs, we developed disinfectant products in record time with our makeup lines. Our creation process, which places consumer feedback at the core of formula validation, is also an asset. We very quickly implemented a home testing system to preserve our research and development dynamics and keep offering our customers innovations. Premium Beauty News - What will be the impact on cosmetics subcontractors? Jean-François Harpès - The decline of consumption – over one or even several years – will obviously have an impact. The companies which were struggling before the crisis will also struggle to survive, and the concentration movement of subcontractors will intensify. It probably means we will have new external growth opportunities which will help us keep diversifying our activities – we started a few years ago. We come from nail varnish, we benefit from a solid growth in the eye and lip categories, and we are interested in complementary categories or markets we are not serving yet. Premium Beauty News - Consumers seem to have strong expectations for the future as regards sustainability, ethics, and production relocation. How do you think the crisis will end? Jean-François Harpès - What is for sure is that the past two months have changed consumption habits. But it would be presumptuous to pretend to know so soon what dimensions consumption will have after the crisis. Generally speaking, product safety will remain a key concern. This trend applies to formulation, production processes, and applicators: all manufacturers are aware that this cannot be negotiated and that expectations get stronger and stronger. Ethics and environmental protection are and will remain key issues. The crisis revealed the weaknesses of very complex global supply chains. From this standpoint, the relocation movement will keep developing: it had already emerged before the pandemic, in particular to meet reactivity and agility needs. The system had shown its limits. And yet, it would be naïve to think there will be a complete return to the past situation. Quality, efficacy, and production costs remain essential issues. So, I do not believe in production fragmentation into a very high number of small plants. The concentration trend will keep spreading. Premium Beauty News - In conclusion, what would you like to tell your customers? Jean-François Harpès - See you tomorrow! We are 100% operational and cannot wait to introduce our latest innovations during one of our webinars!"
Retail: Pure player Birchbox France unaffected by crisis,"Now that they are independent from the American parent company, Birchbox France, headed by Quentin Reygrobellet, co-founder of the initial concept, keeps developing, with a 10% growth rate since the beginning of the year and a two-digit cost-efficiency. And this progress was unexpectedly amplified by the lockdown. “Our traffic has more than doubled, and so has the conversion rate. Our average basket has increased by 40%”, says Quentin Reygrobellet. These dynamics were driven by the arrival of 40% new digital consumers who used to shop offline. Meanwhile, the retailer benefits from the additional interest of new brands previously not referenced on the box and the online store. “They are mainly selective or professional brands sold in places that have had to close their doors. It shows there will a before and after Covid-19. In the digital sector, cosmetics were growing, but they still represented quite a small share, between 10% and 15% of the global market in France. Today, it shows those who were reluctant to use it that the digital solution is actually interesting,” explains the Director. The fun, accessible way consumers discover new products with the box convinced the most receptive who longed to go shopping. Birchbox France saw their box sales double compared to April 2019, which directly impacted the conversion into purchases online. The winning categories include cocooning care, masks, scrubs, hair dyes, hair care… at the expense of makeup and perfume. The sales of the corner green, which already represented 40% of the distributor’s turnover, also boomed. In addition, March marked the launching of a new premium concept, the Splendist box, which guaranteed customers the equivalent of 200 euros of full size products for 49 euros. “We aimed to meet the demand of consumers with different profiles, in particular those more interested in luxury offerings,” explains Quentin Reygrobellet. It seems the objective was fulfilled as soon as the first spring edition: the three-month stock was sold out within 22 days. Every season has its own version. Next one is scheduled in June, and 100,000 pre-orders have already been made. No surprise here: 10 products selected by Birchbox and their partner brands are revealed before the box is purchased. For example, the March box included Garancia, Nuxe, Cacharel, and Tony Molly products. “Contrary to the standard Birchbox, Splendist can be ordered, but we are considering making it available as part of a subscription in the months to come,” adds Quentin Reygrobellet. With 1.2 million subscribers, Birchbox now provides their partner brands with an access to an exclusive offering: Birchbox Analytics, a platform which analyses in real time data on product performances, consumer trends, and customer insights via their shopping experiences online. “Also, we have always wanted to change people’s minds as regards our retailer relationship with brands. Analytics is a completely transparent strategic tool, and we are the only ones to offer it,” the Director says. With five entries available, two for quantitative analyses, and three for qualitative analyses, Birchbox by Analytics makes it possible for brands to follow up in real time both sell-in & sell-out information (global ranking, turnover, market shares) and purchase behaviours (number of products ordered, recurrence, basket amount). The quali data provide information about the brand’s beauty profile (preferences and physical characteristics), the box campaign (buyers’ feedback), and the Birchbox beauty profile. “The objective is to realign our respective interests. If brands understand their customers better, our subscribers will eventually be more satisfied,” adds Quentin Reygrobellet. Now that they are operational in Germany and Switzerland, Birchbox aims to keep growing in France, of course, with new offerings and new brands, but also gradually in other European countries, like Italy and the Netherlands. “Our priority is to get off the beaten track to become the first digital beauty destination,” emphasizes Quentin Reygrobellet."
"KKR takes over Coty’s Professional Beauty, which becomes “Wella”","Coty has found a buyer for its professional beauty business, including hair care and hair dyeing brands Wella and Clairol, ghd hair styling tool and the nail polish brand OPI, which will be grouped together in a new standalone company named ""Wella"". Coty acquired the professional beauty and retail hair brands in 2016 from Procter & Gamble. With brands such as Wella Professionals, Nioxin, Professional Sebastian, Londa Professional, Sassoon Professional, Clairol Professional, Wella Color Charm, OPI and ghd, Coty’s Professional Beauty division is the #2 salon professional company globally, after L’Oréal. Under the terms of the agreement, KKR will acquire a 60 percent stake of the new company and Coty will retain the remaining 40 percent interest. Coty’s mass beauty business in Brazil will remain a fully owned business of Coty. This operation is part of a strategic partnership between Coty and KKR, by which the American investment fund will invest $750 million in Coty through convertible preferred shares, which will be followed by an additional $250 million dollars, also in convertible preferred shares, when the transaction will be completed. These transactions will result in significant deleveraging of Coty’s balance sheet. “We are thrilled with this announcement. KKR is one of the world’s preeminent investment firms with an exemplary track record of value creation. As a market leader with one of the strongest portfolios of brands in the professional beauty market, we believe this partnership opens up a new set of opportunities for ‘Wella,’ our people, and our brands,” commented Sylvie Moreau, President of Coty Professional Beauty. KKR has a long track record of investing in branded consumer businesses, including the beauty sector. Its portfolio includes 109 companies with over US$157 billion in annual revenues and employing more than 637,500 people. “We are excited to form this partnership to invest in Coty to support it through this period of unprecedented global uncertainty and allow it to emerge as a stronger, more agile business, and to acquire a majority stake in Wella, a market leader with a strong portfolio of brands in the attractive professional hair market where we see significant opportunities to accelerate growth in partnership with its experienced leadership team. We look forward to working towards the establishment of a lasting and value-creating strategic partnership,” said Johannes Huth, Partner and Head of KKR EMEA. The final deal is expected to be signed by the end of May."

Anjac H&B Group keeps growing with Roval Cosmétiques acquisition,"Specialized in cosmetics formulation, manufacturing and filling, food supplements, medical devices and drugs, the Anjac H&B Group keeps growing, as they have just purchased Normandy-based company Roval Cosmétiques, an expert in cosmetics and hygiene products. Founded in 1980 by Yannick Brunet, Roval Cosmétiques formulates, manufactures, and fills ranges of perfume, toiletries, and hygiene, hair care and skincare products. The company owns two cosmetics production sites in France, in Flers, Normandy, one in Spain (Roval Cosmética), in Alcover, South of Barcelona, and one site for plastic bottle injection, also in Normandy. Roval Cosmétiques is also Ecocert-certified for the manufacturing of organic-certified products. Thanks to this acquisition, Anjac H&B Group completes their portfolio of product expertise with categories they did not or almost did not yet cover (hygiene products, hair care, perfume). But above all, the group gains significant production capacity with “renowned industrial excellence” they aim to rely on for future prospects. “Every new purchase is an opportunity for us to expand our industrial expertise and exclusive innovative capability”, emphasizes Aurélien Chaufour, General Manager of Anjac Health & Beauty. “This operation represents a major step in our development. It is perfectly in line with our strategy in terms of industrial expectations and continuous investment: we endeavour to keep satisfying our customers and markets with a high added value”, he adds. “Within this Group, Roval will be able to complete and reinforce strengths, as well as share skills,” says Yannick Brunet, founder of Roval Cosmétiques. Thanks to this purchase, Anjac H&B achieves a turnover of more than 400 million euros. Today, the group counts over 2,000 employees in France, Spain, and the US. Multiplying purchases over the past few years, the French family group has gradually become a key beauty player in Europe. They have also recently settled in North America by purchasing Californian company Cosmetix West in September 2019. Today, the group covers the whole cosmetics value chain, from research to finished products, including raw materials, with companies like Laboratoire Shadeline, Euro Wipes, Sicaf, Laboratoires Chemineau, Innovi, Pascual Cosmétiques, or Aircos, in France, Laboratoires Feltor in Spain, and Cosmetix West in the US. “Every new operation provides the group with complementary expertise and new teams that help develop both the offering and technologies,” explains Anne Rutigliano, Marketing & Communications Director of Anjac H&B Group. “Thanks to its industrial strength, Roval Cosmétiques both completes Anjac H&B Group’s know-how and strong capacity and broadens our made in France offering,” she concludes."
"“We need to help our industry take off again soon”, Christophe Masson, Cosmetic Valley ","Premium Beauty News - What was the role of cosmetics industrial companies over the past few days of crisis? Christophe Masson - Starting from mid-March, our economy quickly slowed down as the pandemic arrived in Europe. That is when our industry started playing a role on hand sanitizer manufacturing. The greatest names in the cosmetics world took action to produce this gel, but not just them, and it is a key point to be noted: locally, many SMEs spontaneously supplied hospitals, nursing homes, and healthcare centres. Then, so that the collective effort could go even further, the Cosmetic Valley issued a call for production which was answered by several dozens of companies. We opened a hotline and put hospitals in contact with manufacturers. That was most important, because none of them really knew how to proceed. Premium Beauty News - Has it changed the relationships and cooperation among the different players? Christophe Masson - As far as hand sanitizers are concerned, manufacturers were soon faced with a lack of supplies, like raw materials and packaging items. So, new operating ways emerged. We observed new solidarity dynamics in our industry. The companies whose activities had been slowing down, but still had stock, sent it to those that could produce the gel. It created a sort of virtuous chain, and the Cosmetic Valley made this easier. A few years ago, we had launched a platform called Impact Plus to put plants with raw materials or pack items left in contact with potential users, like startups, who sometimes need small quantities. So, we gave all French cosmetics companies free access to the platform, and over 200 companies used the tool to register either as a manufacturer in need for supplies or as a stock supplier. A real collaborative system among all companies in the sector was created, and both our companies and their employees were willing to get involved. Premium Beauty News - Do you think things will be any different when it is all over? Christophe Masson - It is tricky to give figures now on companies’ economic situation, but the good news comes from Asia: things have taken off again there. It is definitely a sign which helps anticipate “the after Covid-19”. But we still worry about the West: the crisis has been deepening in the US, and everyone knows how vital this market is for our cosmetics industry. Premium Beauty News - Does that question the value chain and the dependence of our production on global markets? Christophe Masson - As regards dependence, we have to put things into perspective. We are not in the same situation as other sectors, like medicines, where dependence is a critical issue. However, this crisis shows we need to intensify our efforts with manufacturers by supporting SMEs, so that they gain skills and innovate: this way, made in France products will be even more qualitative, safe and innovative. This is vital for us to stand out and preserve our leadership. To boost our economy, we will also need to develop dynamics based on collaboration, solidarity, and responsibility, as can be seen with gel manufacturing. It also echoes the need for our industry to move towards even more CSR. On the global level, French companies are ahead in this field, and it will be a strong value and differentiation parameter for made in France products. Premium Beauty News - What are the financial issues and what will be the future like for the whole industry? Christophe Masson - We export all over the world, so if consumption slows down, our business just cannot do well, even if our companies are competitive on the global stage [note: the cosmetics industry is ranked second among net exporting sectors in the French economy – source: French customs, 2019]. We might also lose market shares if we boost our economy later and more slowly than our Asian friends. It is definitely a worrying issue. So, we need to start working ASAP on how we will proceed. The Cosmetic Valley puts companies in contact with public authorities and supports them with the extensions of due dates and credit carryovers guaranteed by the State. Our role consists in making it easier for company directors to get through this real obstacle course. But above all, we need to get ready for what comes next, i.e. convince the government and local authorities to consider French cosmetics as a strategic industry which needs help to quickly take off again. It is essential to implement boosting dynamics for this sector mainly composed of companies which are small, but export a lot."
Nail polish: Fiabila dispels some given ideas,"Premium Beauty News - At the time of apps helping buyers control the content of products, it seems that a lot of consumers are convinced that a traditional nail polish is composed of ""risky"" ingredients? Alexandre Miasnik - The European cosmetics regulation, the strictest in the world, protect consumers from all products incorporating harmful substances. This is particularly the case for formaldehyde and certain recently banned phthalates. As a consequence, Fiabila has been integrating this requirement, to the benefit of all its customers, for over 20 years, regardless of the country and therefore of regulations in force, and this, for all our production plants across the world. But to go even further in our development of a ""clean"" version, we also excluded from formulas all controversial ingredients, such as toluene or camphor, suspected of being allergens, even if they are authorized by regulations. On top of it, our laboratories are equipped with very efficient tools to control and ensure the purity of raw materials used and received, one batch after another. Premium Beauty News - A natural polish is clean by definition? Alexandre Miasnik - As with all segments in cosmetics, the analogy between natural and ""clean"" is often misleading. Natural raw materials can be produced in an unsustainable way or potentially cause allergies; this can be the case in particular, with some resins extracted from conifers or some essential oils. Conversely, a biochemistry-derived, synthetic product can be perfectly safe for use and sustainable. Fiabila was able to formulate a 97% natural polish. However, to propose a holding power and brightness rivalling that of ""traditional"" polishes, we offer green versions with up to 85% natural ingredients. These consumer products thus combine naturalness and perfect safety. Premium Beauty News - Can a nail polish be labelled organic or vegan? Alexandre Miasnik - There is no organic certification, to date, for nail polishes. However, Fiabila offers 100% vegan formulas containing no ingredients of animal origin, which is also the case with the pigments used. To comply with European regulations, none of our cosmetics are animal-tested. Premium Beauty News - The production of polish has a reputation for having a significant impact on the environment! Alexandre Miasnik - Each manufacturer follows its own commitments. The commitments of Fiabila focus on investing in a closed-circuit production tool, whether in France, the United States or Brazil, thus limiting solvent evaporation as much as possible. Waste has also been reduced by a third over the past 4 years. We are the only nail polish manufacturer in the world to offer such infrastructures. Premium Beauty News - The nail polish segment is not known for being very innovative Alexandre Miasnik - A large part of our investments are dedicated to innovation with a consequent R&D service of 40 people, and we also very recently doubled the surface area of our laboratories. Our formulations are constantly evolving, particularly with regard to the development of both, safe, particularly long-lasting formulas and natural pigments. For instance, our laboratory has recently developed a patented technology, based on an innovative oligomer, which polymerizes in daylight and thus offers a physical hardening and the flexibility of a traditional polish, but with a holding power and shine exceeding 7 days. We adapted this technology to LED lamps, to offer an alternative solution to semi-permanent polishes applied in institutes with up to two weeks’ hold. All this, with no use of monomers, and with a nail polish removal routine that can be done at home, with a traditional solvent. For more information, see: www.fiabila.com"
Coronavirus: beauty giant Unilever unveils huge ‘United for America’ initiative,"As part of a wider global effort by the company, #UnitedForAmerica will see Unilever United States partner with the non-profit organization Feeding America to donate food, soap, personal hygiene and home cleaning products worth more than USD 8 million to help those impacted by the pandemic. The products, which will be distributed via a national network of foodbanks, include items from the personal hygiene brands Dove, Suave, Degree, TRESemmé, Shea Moisture and Axe. The initiative will also include home cleaning and sanitization products from the brand Seventh Generation and food products from Knorr, Hellmann’s/Best Foods and Lipton. ""Unilever is ‘United for America’ because we are all in this together and only together will we defeat this virus,"" said Fabian Garcia, president of Unilever North America, via a statement. ""Our people are committed to supporting all Americans - especially those most in need - with the resources to act to protect the wellbeing of their families and their communities. We will do this by ensuring access to hygiene, nutrition and sanitation products, and by working through our brands to inform and educate people to help them in this difficult time."" The conglomerate is also donating more than 200,000 masks for healthcare workers in local hospitals in New Jersey, as well as working towards a national ‘Day of Service.’ Scheduled for May 21, the event will see Unilever United States donate every single essential item produced at its 14 US factories that day (or products of equal value) to community partners serving people in need. The company will also redirect its entire marketing and advertising spend for that day to promote non-profit partners, relief organizations and other community groups. United for America follows the news, announced earlier this week, that Unilever was implementing wide-ranging measures to help people all around the world suffering from the crisis. These include donating soaps and sanitizer worth at least EUR 50 million to the COVID Action Platform of the World Economic Forum, and offering EUR 500 million of cash flow relief to support livelihoods across its extended value chain. “Remarkably, until there is a vaccine for Covid-19, soap remains our best first line of defence. Medical authorities are clear: washing our hands thoroughly and frequently with soap, or using sanitiser where soap and water are not available, is one of the most effective ways to arrest the spread of infection. As the world’s biggest soap company, we have a responsibility to help. We have a social, medical and moral obligation to make soap more readily available worldwide. We have to deploy our expertise in how to teach people to handwash effectively, whichever brand they choose to use,” said Alan Jope, CEO of Unilever.  The conglomerate announced initiatives in the US, India, China, UK, Netherlands, Italy and many other countries."
"“There will be a before and after Covid-19,” Patrick O’Quin, FEBEA","Premium Beauty News - The beauty industry is joining forces to produce hygiene products in mass, in particular hand sanitizers. This ability to take action confirms the importance of this sector in France!  Patrick O’Quin - First, it confirms that cosmetic products are essential to our everyday lives. Contrary to preconceived ideas, they are not frivolous products. Hygiene products and toiletries (soap, shower and bath products, hair products, toothpaste…), which represent a significant part of what our industry produces, actually play a vital role in our daily lives. Beyond daily hygiene, skincare products help our skin better manage the increased frequency of hand washing. Plus, even if we are confined, we need to feel good about ourselves. All psychologists recommend we keep taking care of our appearance at home. Again, cosmetic products are a keystone in this search for wellness. Premium Beauty News - What is the outcome of this initiative so far? Patrick O’Quin - It is too early to say. But we do know that over 30 companies have converted their production lines to meet this new demand. And those that keep manufacturing the same hygiene products as usual should also be counted. Over 10% of our members took action from the very beginning, whether major groups or SMEs. However, it should be said that manufacturing antibacterial hand gel requires taking precautions and cannot be done on any industrial tool. The companies that handle alcohol as part of their usual processes have been the most reactive, but it is only natural. Premium Beauty News - How are products distributed? Patrick O’Quin - Distribution criteria are set up with public authorities, and we centralize part of the supply and demand in partnership with the Cosmetic Valley. Hospitals and health centres are the top priority… Premium Beauty News - The crisis related to the Covid-19 epidemic has been shaking the whole economy. Are you considering asking for specific measures for the cosmetics industry? Patrick O’Quin - Not yet. General measures applying to all sectors have been taken. Together with other industrial sectors, we have sent short-term requests, in particular to facilitate logistics in emergency situations. That is how movement restrictions were lifted in the weekend. Premium Beauty News - Some retailers have suspended their payments, so that brands, in particular small ones, are experiencing difficult times. Patrick O’Quin - Indeed, we have heard of that, but not from our members. The cosmetics industry is not the only one concerned, and MEDEF [largest employer federation in France] has sent all companies a letter to prevent these behaviours. Conviction measures are implemented first. To us, from a legal standpoint, the notion of “force majeure” is questionable in this case, so it is up to the accusing party to provide evidence that all conditions are met. Premium Beauty News - The epidemic highlights the structural weaknesses of supply chains. Patrick O’Quin - Obviously, there will be a before and after Covid-19, and supply chain fragmentation strategies will need to be reviewed. Many companies had already changed their practices. And as circular economy and sustainable development concepts are gaining importance, we can definitely expect a real transformation in both consumer expectations and company processes. This crisis might also help the European Commission give further thought to what circular economy actually is – a real green deal which better takes into account value chains, and not just plastic bashing. It is too easy and little relevant. Premium Beauty News - It also seems that the epidemic is marking a return to borders, in the world of course, but maybe also in Europe. Are you expecting a swing in economic and commercial policies? Patrick O’Quin - Obviously, renationalization and bilateralism have been making progress. American President Donald Trump’s politics are the best example. But, as we operate in a global market, we still believe in multilateralism. Cosmetics manufacturers endeavour to partner on the global level as regards issues of common interest: the end of animal testing and alternative methods – Europe is far ahead when it comes to these matters – the environment, sun filters, and consumer information. Dealing with issues of general interest in a joint effort offers huge collective advantages."
Kure Bazaar now offers coordinated lipsticks with its clean nail polishes,"Relying on a trendy positioning and a selective choice of its points of sale, the Kure Bazaar brand has quickly made a name for itself in the world, as the trend reference for clean make-up. ""Initially we wanted to propose one of the only colour cosmetic products, whose formula did not have a natural alternative: nail polish,"" explains Christian David, co-founder with Kartika Luyet of the brand. With this in mind and an unbridled and very trendy approach to colours, Kure Bazaar launched its first clean formulas, developed in collaboration with the manufacturer Fiabila. One season after another, these colours have added to one another, enriching a catalogue, which now consists of 80 references. Building on the ’lips and nails’ colour duo, which, in the 1990s, was a basics of women make-up, Kure Bazaar is now combining its best-selling nails polishes with 30 shades of coordinated lipsticks. ""For the past 4 years we have been focusing on this requirement often expressed by our customers. While changing nothing to our colour specifics, we applied to lipsticks, our vision of making as clean as possible formulas,"" specifies Christian David. With 32 references, 29 shades, 3 textures (matte, satin and coloured balm), this substantial launch in the category, is based on vegan formulas containing up to 100% natural ingredients, rich in vegetable butters (mango, pomegranate, organic cranberry…) and colour pigments derived from synthetic micro-powders. In line with a comprehensive clean approach, the recyclable aluminium packs are refillable. The base of the tube, which is home to the interchangeable grape clipping is made of recyclable PET. The cases can be covered with a recycled jean fabric hand-sewn in Italy. ""We wanted to demonstrate that it was a product worth keeping and that, as such, it deserved to be taken care of,"" notes the founder. An approach, which is in a way, an allusion to the brand’s proximity to the world of fashion. Launched exclusively in Paris, at Bon Marché Rive Gauche in 2012 and now distributed worldwide, in controlled and selective distribution channels (concept stores, department stores, luxury hotels, etc.), Kure Bazaar has managed to convince adepts of natural luxury. ""Formulating naturally, means engaging in a discourse, it is a particular twist that immediately strikes the customer’s sensitive cord,"" concludes Christian David."
Coronavirus: The cosmetics industry steps up to address the health emergency,"Earlier this week, the L’Oréal group unveiled a Europe-wide solidarity program aimed at supporting the medical, food distribution, beauty and non-profit industries. The French beauty giant is ramping up its production of hand sanitizer in order to bolster supplies for health authorities across France and Europe. In a bid to protect small and medium-sized beauty businesses such as salons and perfume shops from folding under the economic impact of the crisis, L’Oréal has said it will freeze payments due from its distribution networks until business picks up, and increase the frequency of payments to its suppliers where needed. Unfortunately, this exemplary decision from the cosmetics giant, is not imitated by all business players. Indeed, according to information received by Premium Beauty News, several key retailers - whose physical stores are currently closed in France - have chosen to suspend all payments to their suppliers, thus aiming to protect their cash position. In France, the Federation of beauty companies (FEBEA) has announced a strong mobilization of the cosmetics industry to guarantee the supply of basic hygiene products required for the implementation of barrier gestures, such as handwashing. According to the FEBEA and the French Cosmetic Valley, over 50 companies - from multinational firms to SMEs - in the cosmetics sector have volunteered to supply the products requested by health authorities. For instance, in addition to LVMH, Hermès, Coty and L’Oréal, the Grasse-headquartered Arthès group, will supply hand sanitizers to hospitals in the south-east of France, the Guinot-Mary Cohr group, has mobilized its factory in Dammarie-les-Lys (greater Paris area), and the Eugène Perma group put its Reims site (North-East of France) into a battle footing.  Upstream of the industry, Arkema, a manufacturer of specialty chemicals, has decided to repurpose a pilot line at their Rhône Alpes Research Center (CRRA), near Lyon, in order to manufacture 20 tons of alcohol-based solution per week to be distributed free of charge and as a matter of urgency to hospitals in France. ""Concretely, this means that many companies that usually manufacture perfumes or soaps have already launched or are about to launch a dedicated production line to manufacture hydroalcoholic gels complying with one of the governmentally approved formulas,"" explains Patrick O’Quin, the president of FEBEA. ""It is by being strong, organized and united that we will overcome this particularly troubled period,"" added Didier Martin, president of the Eugène Perma group. His company has already produced more than 100,000 units of 100ml hand sanitizers, which are offered to hospitals all over France, but also made available to the group’s employees in Reims and Paris headquarters. In Switzerland, fragrance maker Firmenich has adapted its production to donate 20 tons of disinfectant solution to the Geneva University Hospital (HUG), and medical and emergency services. In Spain, the National Perfumery and Cosmetics Association (Asociación Nacional de Perfumería y Cosmética - Stanpa) announced that it is working with companies in the sector to provide the nation and the health system with the much needed alcohol-based hand sanitizers. “It is important to highlight that, due to the low rate of use of this type of products under normal conditions, the production of sanitizing gels and solutions is usually quite specific and somewhat minor in the production of companies, mostly SMEs. In recent weeks, all of them had increased their capacity to supply the system almost to the limit, either through pharmacies, supermarkets or directly to hospitals,” explains Stanpa. In the UK, among other initiatives, British soap bar brand Nuddy is giving away free soap to customers, with the brand taking to Instagram to explain: ""We believe that EVERY BODY should have the means to wash their hands properly, keep bacteria at bay and try and prevent the spread of this horrible virus."" In the US, Hudson Valley Skincare has also suspended production in order to focus on making hand sanitizer for people in its local community."
"BWX, the “House of Natural Brands”, is experiencing a strong momentum","Premium Beauty News - Last month, BWX announced that Sukin’s skin and hair care lines just arrived at Target.com and were available over 800 brick and mortar Target stores across the U.S.A. early February. Dave Fenlon - As a pioneer in the clean skincare movement, we continue to champion the environment, giving consumers peace of mind that their Sukin products will not negatively impact our planet. In fact, our goal is to leave the Earth better than we found it. In Australia, Sukin is the number one natural skincare brand, and we’re excited to see our products in the hands of new customers on Target.com. We’re thrilled to be a part of the vast expansion of clean beauty that Target is leading in the U.S. Premium Beauty News - What is your international strategy?  Dave Fenlon - We have a distinct regional focus on Asia Pacific, North America, and select international markets like Germany and the UK. These are BWX’s engine markets where we are seeing the most sales and where there is strong consumer acceptance of our brands. BWX has headquarters in Melbourne, Australia, and California, USA to support this global focus. Premium Beauty News - Do you have any planned investment?  Dave Fenlon - At the moment the team is very focused on investing into brand marketing and our people. By marketing we mean investing in our core brands of Sukin, Andalou Naturals, Mineral Fusion and Nourished Life through more digital and social platforms to more effectively educate consumers on the benefits of natural skincare that is affordable, good for you and the environment too. We also listen to our consumers and pay attention to their personal care needs which inspires and innovates new product development.

The Group will continue its investment in brand building, capability and innovation to drive deeper connections with consumers globally while maintaining a sharp focus on controlling our cost. Premium Beauty News - Anything you would like to add? Dave Fenlon - The Group has delivered a strong financial performance in the first half, with net revenue growing 23% to $84.1m and underlying EBITDA increasing 63% to $11.6m. BWX is well-placed in the growing global beauty and personal care industry, which is expected to reach the value of US$616 billion by 2022, growing at 5.8% annually. We are investing in direct-to-consumer marketing to educate and grow our addressable market; and we are focused on consumer-led innovation in new product development, all underpinned by a multi-channel retail approach and user-friendly digital platforms that accelerate direct-to-consumer access. The positioning of each brand is important: Sukin: the #1 natural skincare brand in Australia Natural pharmacy, Andalou Naturals: the #1 natural skincare brand in North American Natural channel, Mineral Fusion: the #1 natural cosmetics brand in North American Natural channel and Nourished Life: one of Australia’s leading natural personal care and lifestyle B2C platforms."

Napoleon Perdis: The Aussie icon saved from the brink and ready more than ever for 2020,"When Napoleon Perdis appointed administrators, the brand owed more than $22 million to creditors including the ANZ bank, the Australian Taxation Office, Australian Pharmaceutical Industries and Myer - with $16 million in “accumulated losses” sitting in the US branch of the company. While Mr Lee wasn’t with the business at the time, he suspects the brand made a “typical mistake” common among retailers that enter the US market - over-investing in infrastructure such as warehouses and stores too quickly before sales actually start pouring in. Premium Beauty News had the chance to meet with Mr Lee. Premium Beauty News - When did you buy Napoleon Perdis and why? Henry Lee - We acquired the business in mid-April 2019 after conducting 6 months of due diligence. The irony is the top-line numbers were there and it was very well received but the numbers did not justify the infrastructure ahead of sales. It’s a typical mistake a lot of Australian retailers make, thinking they should go in big and build 10 stores because the US is such a big market, but it just doesn’t work like that. The losses were propped up by the Australian arm through a combination of debt and working capital which put enormous pressure on the business and resulted in poor decisions which coincided with Australia’s tough retail climate. The Australian business was still profitable but couldn’t sustain the levels of debt, a heavy corporate structure that included dual offices in Europe and Australia and wage and rent expenses for its 80 stores. This had a resulting impact on cashflow, which affected stock levels and ultimately led to a further decline in sales. This is a death spiral that has been played out by so many retail businesses of late. The founder and namesake was a pioneer, a leading authority in the beauty industry and his craft in makeup artistry meant that he was an insider for new trends and innovation. He invented new categories and released products before consumers even knew they needed them. Case in point, our best-selling product is our iconic primer, first introduced more than 15 years ago. To this day we continue to sell one primer every 90 seconds. He was still surprised by the “panic buying” that took place once news of the administration broke when the chain’s future was still unclear, with some customers snapping up enough primers and foundations to last “several years”. Napoleon Perdis is ranked the number one Australian brand in the Prestige Cosmetic segment. It’s also an iconic brand with a cult-like following from professional makeup artists and end-consumers, both in Australia and internationally. The opportunity to acquire such an established and well-loved brand does not come up often, nor does the opportunity to reset a business and re-build it on a solid foundation. This was a challenge we were excited to tackle. Premium Beauty News - As the forefront of runway trends and innovation, Napoleon Perdis Cosmetics will be the official makeup partner for MBFWA in 2020. Henry Lee - We are proud to announce our official makeup partnership with Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia 2020. As MBFWA celebrates its 25th anniversary, we are excited to bring the artistry that has defined Napoleon Perdis to the event. We look forward to sharing our creative expertise and continued passion for the fashion and beauty industry as Australia’s leading professional makeup brand. Premium Beauty News - What is your international strategy?  Henry Lee - The broader market beyond Australia is extremely important to us, and we expect that international sales will exceed domestic sales by the end of 2020. Clearly, we have our sights set on two of the largest consumers of cosmetics – the North American market and China. The brand has previously had good traction in the U.S. market, having been stocked in Bergdoff Goodman, Neiman Marcus and Ulta. To capitalise on this, we are currently in discussions with several U.S. based department stores and hope to re-enter the North American market in the next 12 to 18 months. In July 2019, we partnered with Access Corporate Group, and launched into the China market via a cross-border e-commerce platform. This has been a phenomenal success having generated $30m in retail sales in as little as 6 months, and this will grow exponentially in the coming year. And over the next three years, Kuba Investments has budgeted to invest more than $21 million in brand development and marketing alone to reconnect with “loyalists” and engage with new customers."
"“Sustainably addressing a broader variety of brands and consumer needs is one of our biggest challenges”, Thomas Espinosa, Schwan Cosmetics","Premium Beauty News - Schwan Cosmetics is a key player in the global make-up market. What is your analysis of current trends? Tomas Espinosa - The global beauty market is facing challenging changes and shows big contrasts depending on the region. While Asia is growing across all categories, we see mixed signals in Europe and the USA, partly struggling with a shift into skin care and closely related make-up categories. Eventually, despite a tense economic situation in many countries, big brands are still emerging in South America. Besides, manufacturers must adapt to the new rules of the market: Since significant changes to the barrier of entry occurred, new brands, with different business models, are able to gain a significant share of the market. Brands can now emerge from a strong Instagram presence, for instance. Some of them spike and disappear as fast as they appeared, whereas others have become key-players in the industry. Despite the challenges of this ever-changing market, there are still many new opportunities for growth and success. Consequently, we need to be more flexible and agile to meet consumer demands and customer needs. Premium Beauty News - Is your industrial tool able to address these new challenges? Tomas Espinosa – We are confident it is. Current market trends are more oriented towards regionalisation than globalisation. Our global footprint permits us to respond to the rising needs for short, local and flexible supply chains. Today, most of our technologies are expanded on a global scale. We are investing heavily in digital technology and process manufacturing in order to deliver the best performing formulas and product quality, regardless of the location. In addition, we are consistently expanding our machinery to offer a broad variety of packaging designs. Premium Beauty News - The other big trend is sustainability? Tomas Espinosa - Sustainability is the biggest challenge of our time, raising a lot of questions. One of the key questions is how to communicate on green features? How consumers can have a broad picture of the entire impact of a product, and how to measure it? How to provide accurate information? Transparency is therefore a key topic and a key request. Younger generations have become more concerned about environmental challenges and especially about the negative impact of plastic. From this point of view, our expertise in wood processing is a big asset. In 2018, for instance, we launched a wood technology that is able to compete with plastic pencils for long lasting formulas. As far as sustainability is concerned, we believe short supply chains and plastic reduction are key answers. But we are also working on cleaner formulations and the end life of the components, with biodegradability and recyclability being big challenges. For instance, we are developing single material designs as well as a refillable product range. At this year’s Cosmopack Bologna, we will be introducing new products and solutions focusing on the three pillars sustainability, transparency and well-being. Our objective is to provide brands with a comprehensive sustainable concept in order to discuss the best options for their needs together."
"Make-up: ""Deciphering and anticipating the expectations of generations Y and Z to create winning connections""","When it comes to make-up, the youngest generations are leading the way! Millennials (Generation Y or digital natives), born between 1981 and 1997, have transformed the world of make-up in North America and Europe, by endorsing brands who have understood how to reach them via social networks, and offer them breakthrough products: NYX, Anastasia Beverly Hills, Too Faced, Glossier. Born after 1997, in an already highly digitalized world, the gen Z is emerging as the new challenge for the cosmetics industry. Ultra-connected, expert in communication, ultra-creative and eager for collaboration and inclusiveness, while asserting its individuality, this generation is instrumental to changing radically the way of addressing one’s self-image. Attentive to global issues, the Gen Z does not hesitate to state its convictions during protests against climate change for example, but also through its purchases by favouring brands with a crystal-clear commitment, in line with their values. Selfies, snapchats, Instagram posts and stories, digital natives and the gen Z live in a world of assertiveness. Explorers of alternatives, addicted to the most diverse online content, they move from one platform to the other, follow influencers, improve their beauty culture thanks to the tutorials, comments and tips of their peers. Fashion and beauty brands are scrutinized and evaluated at high speed by generations who know they have gained a new influence. Always more demanding towards brands, they want products corresponding to their own definition of cosmetics and allowing to state one’s specific expression, but avoiding stereotypes and placing the emphasis on inclusiveness. ""When it comes to make-up, decoding the consumption habits of these generations is vital for brands. For IL Cosmetics, as an industrial partner, it is a key element of our expertise in the world of make-up. Our mission is to help our customers understand, and even anticipate the needs of their consumers. This is why we created IL VIEW’R, a strategic tool to foster innovation from a new consumer perspective"", underlines Aurélie Ignaccolo, Head of Marketing at IL Cosmetics, one of the European leaders in nail polish and make-up products based in Luxembourg. To enrich its draft project beyond consumer panels, IL Cosmetics thus collaborates with beauty consultants and make-up artists. ""It is both a question of complementing our expertise and of having a vision focused on consumer expectations,"" explains Aurélie Ignaccolo. As part of IL VIEW’R, the Luxembourg Company offers a detailed analysis of the habits and expectations of consumers who are increasingly versatile, always more connected, more and more attached and attentive to the values expressed by brands. These expectations are connected to the DNA and positioning of brands. A 360-degree approach that will very soon be enhanced by the exploitation of big data collected online, on social networks, in particular via Google Trends, thus offering an immediate knowledge of the evolution of consumer expectations. And to beef up this offer, new recruits will be joining the IL Cosmetics marketing team, with several profiles totally dedicated to the digital world. ""From these analyses we imagine and design technologies that boost the potential of products. What we offer is therefore much more than a technical expertise. In addition to this, our developments are based on our analysis and our vision of markets and supported by patented innovative technologies, by our knowledge of raw materials, formulation process and of our exclusive collaborations with experts. With IL VIEW’R we offer a real B2P (business to person) approach, which allows us to precisely define persona profiles, and thus better meet consumers’ expectations,"" stressed Aurélie Ignaccolo. The IL Cosmetics method goes well beyond product development. Once the product has been launched, IL offers to analyse its interaction with consumers. Depending of results, new developments may be put forward, new lines of communication may be recommended. The objective is both to maximize the consumer experience and to generate new opportunities for innovation. And the IL Cosmetics method is paying off! ""Among the millennials’ favourite brands, there are customers for whom we have developed products, which are now emblematic,"" underlines the Marketing Director. The Cosmetify platform ranks a number of key players that have best managed to meet the expectations of young generations. A number of brands for which consumers are showing strong interest (Google Trends data, mentions, commitments and followers on social networks), and ""some of which are IL Cosmetics customers."" For the Luxembourg Company, this success is no coincidence but relies largely on the analysis and innovation tools allowing IL Cosmetics to detect emerging trends and anticipate the expectations of younger generations. ""We can truly say that we are the ideal partner for the millennials’ favourite brands. Throughout 2020, the brands we work with will see an intensification of our efforts in understanding and getting a grasp of consumer expectations, particularly from the analysis of big data coming from social media. A service primarily focused on understanding the generations Y and Z,” concludes Aurélie Ignaccolo."
Meiyume: An immersive and creative path to enchant customer experience in beauty and luxury outlets,"The 2020 edition of the Paris Creative Days organized by Meiyume will be held on the company’s premises in Levallois Perret from 28 to 31 January 2020. During four days, the French subsidiary of the Hong Kong company will offer its customers an interactive and immersive path of approximately two hours to discover its latest innovations and those of its partners. ""The path was designed as an interactive experience, with our partners Opuscope, a start-up specializing in augmented reality with its Minsar platform, and Temera, an Italian company specialised in RFID and digital solutions, who created the application and digitized the path"", explains Magali Galea, Meiyume designer. ""Upon arrival, our customers will be given three QR codes enabling them to enhance their two-hour experience, access additional content and leave comments on products,"" she adds. Their journey will begin in a dark room with an introduction to the event and a digital access to a series of data on the men’s grooming market, as a preamble to the pop-up store experience dedicated to men’s skincare and make-up products, organized in the next room. ""The whole of it steeped in a musical atmosphere adapted to the customer’s experience."" On this occasion, Meiyume will also introduce the expertise of its Retail Solutions Division in collecting and aggregating the data of each customer path. ""Reflecting what we are able to set up in POS, we will analyse the journey of our visitors, the stands where they stopped and the products they handled,"" continues Magali Galea. The collected data will then be analysed by Meiyume and sent to customers to illustrate how this strategic data can be materialized and used for marketing purposes. The path also features three additional stages, each focused on three innovation themes: the sustainability of primary and secondary packagings, including POS; self-expression (packs and product personalization); and digital innovation, with a presentation of innovations proposed by partnering start-ups. Throughout the customer path, particular emphasis will be placed on Meiyume’s expertise in skincare and on the current key ingredient trends - sustainability and formulations with a high level of naturality according to ISO and COSMOS standards - as well as on the company’s growing capabilities in the make-up category, and more specifically, multi-moulding technologies for lipsticks and hybrid formulations. Finally, a connected bar will showcase RFID solutions proposed by Meiyume, and enabling to carry out real time inventories. A chatbot will also interact with visitors to further enrich their journey. With this new edition of its Creative Days in Paris, Meiyume intends to state its ability to aggregate technologies, to quickly propose prototyped innovations and to test them. With bases in Asia, Europe and North America, the company relies on five factories dedicated to the formulation and packaging of cosmetic products, but it also relie a broad network of factories to offer a very complete set of solutions.

The Aromaperfumery of Aimée de Mars combines olfaction and emotion,"But just because Valérie Demars had embarked on the Léa Nature adventure alongside Charles Kloboukoff, does not mean she had forgotten her childhood dream, to create perfumes. In June 2015, she launched the brand Aimée de Mars, named after her grandmother, her source of inspiration. ""It couldn’t be more obvious since I wanted to make love perfumes,"" she says. The range consists of ten fragrances formulated with 96 to 100% ingredients of natural origin. She combines the 21 essential oils used in the composition of each perfume with St Genou spring water, which is renowned for its therapeutic benefits. The production is vegan, and is also based on organic wheat alcohol. ""The idea is to reconnect people to their deepest being through the vibration of the plants and the essential oil, this is the registered concept of Aromaparfums®,"" explains Valérie Demars. Hence, to the olfactory value of the plant is added the emotional action emanating from the essential oil. ""Cheerful bergamot, puts a smile on the lips, immortal helps to overcome emotional blows, etc.,"" Illustrates the perfume creator. Valérie Demars works with a limited palette of 300 natural ingredients, yet the olfactory result is very real with sensual, woody, floral fragrances, with a lasting and assertive trail. “These Eaux de Parfums are a way of reconnecting with the perfumery of times gone by. Many of our customers who no longer wore perfume are now delighted to take a renewed interest in perfumes with these creations. Today, the majority of conventional perfumes are made with more than 80% of chemical ingredients, in which some consumers no longer find their marks,"" explains Valérie Demars. The range of Elixirs brings the combined olfactory and emotional experience to the next level, by including in each bottle a precious or semi-precious stone, carrying beneficial energies. Mystique Améthyste, Sensuel Rubis or Divine Émeraude, the three new compositions, 100% natural and Cosmos certified, like each Elixir de parfum, act on an emotion associated with the mineral. In the Christmas Collection, the precious stones in the bottle are cut and can be recovered from the bottle once empty. With the second brand Eau de Mars, the compositions, again based on AromaPerfumery, are more gourmand and target a young audience. Each perfume is linked to a personality illustrated by a divinity, and a skincare action. Using the Aromatest available on the site, the user can discover the fragrance matching her profile. Proposed at EUR 39 for the 30 ml bottle and EUR 76 for the 50 ml bottle, products from Maison de Mars are available in 400 points of sale in France, in pharmacies, organic stores, the Beauty Success institutes or networks as well as in Germany in the Muller retail network. The e-commerce site is based on the ""Happy or Refunded"" principle, offering for each order three samples, including a sample of the product ordered, with the possibility of returning the product and getting a refund after testing it."
Anjac Health & Beauty is boosting its innovation and leveraging on intrapreneuriality,"Created thanks to successive external growth operations and a dynamic business development, the family Group Anjac Health and Beauty posted sales of EUR 280 million in 2019 with a staff of 1,700 spread in France, Spain and the USA. In a fast-changing environment, where expectations from cosmetic brands vis-a-vis their suppliers are increasing, Anjac Health & Beauty has chosen a very original organizational model intended to consistently offer customers the production and R&D capacities of a large group while preserving the agility and reactive structure of the SMEs composing it. ""It is true that innovation is on the lips of every manufacturers and the term is quite overused. In fact, beauty suppliers and brand owners alike, have understood that, in a world that is constantly accelerating, innovating is the royal road to success, not to say a prerequisite for survival. As far as we are concerned, we are fortunate to be able to rely on a very original and agile organizational model. We advocate intrapreneuriality, the culture to undertake within the Group. And indeed the Group’s ten companies [1]]] benefit from this. In practical terms, the companies’ different general management remain very autonomous, the founder is often always at the head of his company, as is the case for Aircos, Cosmetix West, Feltor, Innovi…"", explains Anne Rutigliano, Head of Marketing and Communication at the Anjac Health & Beauty Group. Relying on small structures and cross-functional innovation in a project mode, accelerates decision-making, preserves the test and learn culture, which is also similar to the way certain brands, in particular indie brands, operate. However, to go one step further and offer more value to its customers, Anjac Health & Beauty also relies on the Group’s specific synergies. ""A Group R&D unit has been created and the teams meet regularly. We are deploying the same type of unit for Marketing teams and we are increasingly integrating consumer trends in our developments,"" explains Anne Rutigliano. Within the Group, expertise in Applied Research, in particular concerning ingredients and molecules, is shared. Abduction research methods, a method of reasoning based on the exploration of very large fields of research, benefit everyone. Innovation in the Anjac Health & Beauty Group is scientific and focused on proven efficiency. In 2019, to give even more value to the innovation dynamics emerging from its teams, and to thank them, Anjac Health & Beauty has launched Anjac’tive, an in-house innovation contest open to its 1,700 employees, and encompassing processes, services and products. The Group also leverages on multiple categorical skills ranging from health products to food supplements, including make-up, personal care and dermocosmetic care, while having a mastery of the entire product designing and manufacturing chain, from ingredients to formulation. ""Our added value stands in our ability to imagine and develop innovative, tailor-made solutions that will have a positive impact on our health and environment. With Innovi, for example, the Group can rely on an entity specializing in research and innovation, capable of developing exclusive ingredients for its customers, depending on the brand’s objectives and positioning,"" adds Anne Rutigliano. The Group proposes a natural ingredient SPF BOOST which allows reducing sunscreen levels while maintaining high SPF levels in formulas. Research teams are working on second-generation effective and sensory, solid cosmetics, biodegradable and compostable masks combined with dermocosmetic formulations for the elderly, diabetic populations, etc. This diversity in companies also makes it possible to deal with customers showing very different profiles, to smooth out capacity problems and to provide continuous business solutions. In terms of innovation, it also allows the Group’s customers to draw on the multiple skills and specialties developed by each company or at group level, with a particular focus on the key expectations of consumers: naturalness and efficiency. Historically, very much focused in the Made in France, the Group recently established itself in North America with the acquisition of Cosmetix West. The expertise and know-how of the Californian company in clean beauty will thus benefit the entire Group, which also plans to transpose its technologies to its new entity to bring more proximity and service to its local customers."
"“It is our responsibility to become a trusted resource within the industry,” Shelley Sullivan, ModelCo","Since the brand’s early beginning, self-tanning has been at the core of ModelCo’s business, closely followed by the premium range of colour cosmetics, both of which gained worldwide attention from collaborations with the likes of creative genius Karl Lagerfeld, high-profile model Hailey Bieber and former Victoria’s Secret Angel and founder of Rose Inc, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Since owning the category back in 2002 with Tan Airbrush In a Can, ModelCo has continued to remain a reputable trusted resource within an industry that has embraced self-tanning. Premium Beauty News - What do you think of today consumers?  Shelley Sullivan - Today’s consumers are demanding and conscious, they want to trust in brands before they make their next purchase and they want to ensure it signifies purpose. We already have a brand that is globally recognised for offering the best quality at an affordable price point, and now we are in a position to be socially responsible and truly relate to our everyday customer. Premium Beauty News - As the brand celebrates its 18th birthday, what was your most challenging experience?  Shelley Sullivan - In 2013 we released Super Tan, a product that created extensive buzz around before the official launch. We approved the formula internally, yet it was produced wrong with an over-developed green base and turned our customers green. It was a real turning point for the business and put us in a vulnerable position, and we had to rebuild customer loyalty through direct consumer communications. Shelley Sullivan A trailblazer of the Australian beauty industry, ModelCo’s CEO and founder Shelley Sullivan is undoubtfully one of most significant female entrepreneurs in the Australian Beauty industry today. Early in her career Sullivan started her successful model and talent agency before shifting her focus to beauty after identifying a new opportunity to create sophisticated, yet purposeful beauty products that delivered what they promised, proved performance and exuded a sense of luxury at an affordable price point. More than 18 years after the brand’s foundation, ModelCo has grown to peak success with globally-renowned collaborations and international stockists while constantly evolving to reflect what women seek in their beauty routines. Last year, Sullivan launched MCoBeauty, a luxe-for-less beauty range that caters to the mass market grocery space. Premium Beauty News - Where do you position the brand now?  Shelley Sullivan - We wanted to take a real-life approach to self-tanning and evolve how we speak to the everyday consumer, sparking conversations about beauty with meaning. As we continue to foster brand loyalty, it is our responsibility to become a trusted resource within the industry. ModelCo is a brand that allows people to become part of the conversation through relevance. Premium Beauty News - What is next for ModelCo?  Shelley Sullivan - Our global presence has always been at the forefront of ModelCo. It started with our world-first Tan Airbrush In a Can that gained worldwide attention, and went on to be sold in the likes of Colette in Paris, Sephora and New York’s Henri Bendel. We’ve always had a uniqueness to assemble our products with trending celebrities which is another success driver of expanding our global fan base. There has been a lot of interest around ModelCo tan and cosmetics in the US for 2020, and we’re looking to widen our distribution."
"""Our goal is to continue to build our unique ecosystem with a strategy that goes well beyond the box"", Quentin Reygrobellet, Birchbox France","Premium Beauty News - What motivated your decision to do without Birchbox to continue the adventure? Quentin Reygrobellet - It was a real desire on our part, we had reached a point where our life stages were different. It seemed logical for both parties to be able to move forward independently. For our part, the company was profitable and growing steadily with a virtuous and sustainable model. By regaining possession of our working tool, we are now opening a third chapter with just as much adrenaline and all the maturity acquired in past years. Our goal is to continue to build the unique ecosystem created over the past 7 years, with a strategy that goes well beyond the box. The box is a discovery experience, a way to consume better, but it is not an end in itself, we know this from the start. It accounts for 60% of our turnover thanks to 220,000 subscribers, the remaining 40% comes from the sale of large size products on the site with 1.2 million customers who subscribe and buy on the e-site and interact with us. We are going to speed up the pace in these two areas: sales through online retail and the increase in the number of subscribers. Premium Beauty News - Precisely what will happen in 2020 with this idea as a driver? Quentin Reygrobellet - We are focusing our development on three directions. The first concerns data - the core of our business from the start - namely the ability to send the right product, the right message to the right person. Today the challenge for brands is to establish a direct contact with consumers. We were one of the main players to pioneer this cross-talk between the brand and its subscribers. We have therefore chosen to make this data freely available to our partnering brands, in an open source mode. They will have access in real time via a platform, to the various data concerning our subscribers, to their sales performance on our site, to all the quantitative and qualitative elements regarding their customers and to a comparison with their competitors. It is a real innovation seen nowhere else. For example, a brand will be able to know which are the other brands in the basket of the customer and therefore which products suit her. It is an asset for the brand and ultimately for the consumer. Through the data provided, we participate in creating products much more in line with the customer’s expectations. It is hand in hand work. Premium Beauty News - You also bank on e-commerce? Quentin Reygrobellet - This is the second line of development through the rise in our number of subscribers. Today we are the leader in online sales of cosmetics. The overall beauty market in France represents around 14 billion, while the digital market only represents 1.4 billion but it is growing by 20% per year. There is therefore an clear interest in focusing on this market with a very high growth potential. From time to time, we do make some forays in the off-line market be we deeply remain pure digital players. The site is completely cross channel with more than 5000 references coming from 300 selective, pharmacy, niche or mass retail brands. It is open to everyone, even non-subscribers who account for more than 30% of sales. To go further, we will launch next March a discovery subscription offer for more premium products, a new service dedicated to some high-end brands. Premium Beauty News - The third axis concerns your expansion abroad? Quentin Reygrobellet - Indeed, we want to leverage on this absolutely unique beauty ecosystem built in recent years in France, and roll it out to the rest of Europe. In the coming weeks the brand will be launched in various European countries where Birchbox was not present, such as Germany, Italy, Scandinavia, Poland and the Netherlands. Premium Beauty News - Precisely, under which brand name will you operate? Quentin Reygrobellet - For now, under the Birchbox label but we are allowing ourselves 18 months to change the brand, its name. It is a real challenge because this name is known internationally, however we consider that it is also a great opportunity to show that we are going far beyond the box concept. Premium Beauty News - Why did you choose Otium Capital and the French entrepreneur Pierre-Édouard Stérin to support your growth? Quentin Reygrobellet - Things actually happened quite logically with Pierre-Édouard and his team. They have a thorough entrepreneurial vision, a deep knowledge of the beauty market while on the other hand, leaving us free rein and a total mastery of our project. It was a very important element for us."
Henkel continues its transition to more natural products,"“While concerns about the quality and composition of products remain the main reason behind the evolution of purchasing behaviors, environmental concerns are becoming a new lever for change. There is a real quest for meaning in consumption”, explains Charlotte Le Buhan, Marketing Manager France at Henkel Beauty Care. Thus, 69% of French people say they are ready to buy products from companies that demonstrate their transparency and integrity, and 71% say they are ready to buy products from companies that really respect the environment. In order to address the evolution of the European consumption model, the group has chosen to transition all of its brands [2] towards a greener positioning. ""Henkel wants to be a pioneer in offering more sustainable, and more responsible cosmetics that are accessible to everyone"", continues Charlotte Le Buhan. In 2020, all of Henkel Beauty Care’s innovations are therefore designed to incorporate more natural ingredients and be more responsible, including: botanical active ingredients for Diadermine Lift+, a shampoo bar for N.A.E., the organic brand launched by the group at the end of 2018, Schwarzkopf launches Nature Moments, an eco-labeled hair care brand with a minimum of 92% ingredients of natural origin, etc. As far as packaging is concerned, Henkel is generalizing the use FSC-certified cardboards (i.e. cardboards sourced from sustainably managed forests), reducing the volume of plastic of certain jars and is massively incorporating a part of recycled plastics in its packaging materials. For instance, the Fa Ocean Passion line features two shower gels in bottles made of 100% recycled plastic, including 50% of plastic collected on beaches. According to the same line, the various brands of the group are also committed alongside various associations dedicated to social or environmental causes."
The Italian “Cosmetic Valley” in rapid transformation,"The region included in a circle of a hundred kilometres in diameter, which centre would be Milan and including the cities of Monza, Bergamo and Crema, is the spearhead of the Italian cosmetics industry. Accordig to the Polo Tecnologico della Cosmesi, the area gathers over 590 businesses in the beauty sector, which in 2017 generated EUR 5.7 billion in sales and with a workforce of more than 25,000 employees. They mainly include manufacturers of machines dedicated to the beauty industry (achieving a turnover of more than EUR 365 million and employing more than 1,300 people), manufacturers of cosmetic formulations, (EUR 3 billion, with 14,000+ staffs) and packaging manufacturers, (EUR 2 billion in sales with 10,000 staffs). Also according to the Polo, 65% of the makeup products sold around the world are produced in the area. With a global demand that has constantly increased, both in volume and quality, over the past five years, the Italian beauty cluster really transformed itself, demonstrating once again its ability to a changing environment. Artcosmetics’ brand new 30,000 m2 factory, which also serves as their headquarters, is emblematic of the transformation of Italian makeup specialists. From EUR 33 million in 2010, the company’s net sales have jumped to EUR 108 million (forecasted) in 2019. Located in Fornovo San Giovanni, near Bergamo, the new facility houses an innovation centre and an R&D lab spanning over 1500 m2 and the bulk production capacity for emulsion and anhydrous has more than doubled. Gotha Cosmetics made a similar move one year ago. The company, which also specializes in the design and manufacture of makeup products, moved to a new administrative and industrial site, a few blocks away from its former location in the North of Milan. The new facility features 3,000 m2 of offices, a production area of 12,000 m2, i.e., twice the size of the previous factory, the whole of it representing an investment of more than EUR 10 million. And the packaging manufacturers did not stayed away from the general movement! Lumson, which has almost doubled in size in five years (the company’s turnover has increased from 49 million euros in 2013 to 96 million in 2018, an average growth of 15% per year), has invested heavily to increase and modernize its production capacities. The company now has brand-new headquarters in Capergnanica, in the suburbs of Crema, together with a state-of-the-art facility dedicated to the production of technical components (mainly airless and atmospheric pumps), and a fully automated warehouse. In June 2019, the production capacity has been increased to135 million pieces, compared to 90 million pieces previously. Two years after the acquisition of Lepolast, a producer of packaging for lipsticks and glosses, Lumson has recently strengthened its make-up business with the acquisition of Marino Belotti, a company specializing in the production of compact cases and other powder boxes. To achieve this transformation, the network of Italian suppliers also had to adapt its capital structure. Mainly family-owned, companies in the beauty industry have gradually opened their capital to investment funds, some of which have sometimes acquired a majority stake. In a context where the global make-up market seems to be slowing down, the Italian industrial fabric can still count on the flexibility of its network, also made up of a multitude of small companies, capable of manually processing small quantities or complex orders. An agile and flexible structure which, combined with a remarkable creativity and product knowledge, is one of the main assets of this cluster."

KDC/ONE and HCT Group merge their businesses to create a giant supplier of full-service make-up  and skincare solutions,"The combined business will provide full-service solutions to make-up and skincare brands through the combination of KDC’s formulation and filling capabilities with HCT’s packaging expertise. Founded in 1992, HCT has grown organically to become a global leader providing packaging and full-service solutions for the cosmetics industry, mainly for the make-up category. With headquarters in Santa Monica, California, and offices in New York, New Jersey, London, Paris, Milan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Shanghai. Following the close of the transaction, Nicholas Whitley, President and CEO of KDC/ONE, and Tim Thorpe, President and CEO of HCT, will continue as CEOs of each business. ""Our vertically integrated platform will offer the industry a true one-stop solution. HCT’s cutting-edge designs, engineering, manufacturing and global reach will enable us to further elevate our product and service offerings to better serve and anticipate the evolving needs of our valued customers,"" said Nicholas Whitley. This new transaction is part of a long series of external growth operations for KDC/ONE over the past four years. Most recently, the company acquired California’s Benchmark Cosmetics Laboratories, France’s ALKOS Group and the manufacturing operations of UK’s Swallowfield."
Le Rouge Français opens new era for natural lipsticks,"Le Rouge Français was born from the will to preserve the sensorial properties of conventional lipsticks without giving up on the naturalness consumers want and get from the organic makeup segment. “The problem was, according to our research, both offerings could be questioned. For example, although it is banned from food, titanium dioxide is accepted in conventional formulas, and mica is tolerated in organic products, although it is a mineral, i.e. a non-renewable resource whose extraction involves unethical practices. So, to us, it was obvious we had to go farther,” explains Salem Ghezaili, President and Co-founder of the company. The founders decided to work on a 100% renewable, 100% natural grape-based formula with natural colourants derived from tinctorial plants. “These plants have been used in textile dyeing for tens of thousands of years, and if Cleopatra used certain pigments like sorghum from the Nile valley for lips, it was never really exploited in makeup,” adds Salem Ghezaili. The products are composed of 95% organic ingredients and 100% natural ingredients, they are Cosmebio and vegan-certified and contain rice wax rather than beeswax to fix pigments. In line with their initial idea, the founders have added a high-end dimension to their offering. “We aimed at showing that we could reach the sensoriality of conventional lipsticks in terms of texture, long wear, and coverage, as well as a higher degree of naturalness than most organic-certified brands,” explains Salem Ghezaili. The unctuous formula rich in shea butter and vegetable oils and waxes is endowed with skincare virtues thanks to its moisturizing properties. Free from any tattooing effect, it lasts as long as a standard lipstick – about four hours. The shade created by the tinting power of plants gives the visual impression of a more natural product with a satin-like appearance. The packaging is also in line with the brand’s values, with its Ecocert-certified, 100% recyclable monomer-based transparent case. In addition, the brand makes it possible for customers to collect used packaging with a prepaid envelope and directly send them to recycling companies. For this end of year, Le Rouge Français launches a capsule collection adorned with leather-looking cases made of apple skin, an alternative to animal skin with the same finish and sensoriality. “Compared to other plant-based skins, apple skin offers a higher biosourced proportion and a better resistance over time,” explains Salem Ghezaili. Case cladding is handmade by a Patrimoine Vivant-certified craftsman. The collection will be released in December: it will be available for €45, compared to €35 for the standard version. About fifteen new colours will be added to the first three by the end of the first quarter 2020. “The colour range may seem too reduced, but we do defend this minimalism. Working with nature also means accepting to have less wide a shade offering,” concludes the Director."
Marvinpac merges its cosmetics business with Strand Cosmetics Europe to form a leading beauty supplier in Europe,"Already partners within the joint-venture MS Swiss Cosmetics, France’s Strand Cosmetics Europe and Switzerland’s Marvinpac are creating MS BEAUTiLAB, a new entity resulting from the merger of Strand Cosmetics Europe and the cosmetics business of Marvinpac. Their aim is to create “one of the European leaders in the beauty and well-being sector.” With three production and filling sites in the Czech Republic, in France and in Switzerland, the new entity also aims to provide more flexibility and agility to its customers.  The Chinese sourcing entity may also support primary and secondary packaging projects for Full Service offers. Effective as of 1st January 2020, the merger is targeting a consolidated turnover of EUR 100 million by 2024. The group employs more than 250 people in Europe (France, Switzerland, Czech Republic), the USA and China. “The only player to offer full-service made-in-France and made-in-Switzerland beauty solutions wants to conquer the hearts of French, Swiss and international brands with its innovative product, concept and technology strategy implemented within the framework of an eco-responsible approach,” explain the two companies in a joint statement. Under the joint management of Eric Bouvier, current CEO of Strand Cosmetics Europe, and Ludovic Hericher, CEO of Marvinpac, MS BEAUTiLAB will be structured into two specialised Business Units: MS Advanced Skincare Solutions, headed by Camille Schmit Deroin, for skincare, and Strand High Tech Color Cosmetics, headed by Denis Richard Orliange, for makeup. “Each Business Unit is structured around four departments - Project, Product Marketing, Sales, R&D - facilitating the detailed analysis of the target market and its trends, a collaborative internal and external agile work mode and relevant and personalised recommendations,” writes the release. The creation of two Business Units should help to increase the specialisation of the staff in order to deliver more expertise, creativity, innovation and reactivity with a view to addressing the time-to-market, robustness, and performance demands of the group’s clients. ""There is specialized make-up equipment, particularly in the French site, but all of the facilities are available to each of the Business Units and production operations will be organized according to customer priorities: schedule, volume, origin requirement (made in France, Swiss made, etc.),” Éric Bouvier and Ludovic Hericher told Premium Beauty News."
Cosmetics giant Shiseido gambles on ’Made in Japan’,"The Japanese cosmetics industry faces huge competition not only from global and established players such as L’Oréal and Estée Lauder but increasingly also from the ""K-beauty"" craze coming from South Korea. Nevertheless, Japan is more than holding its own, with exports nearly quadrupling since 2013 to 546 billion yen (US$5 billion) last year, according to finance ministry figures, nearly two-thirds of that going to China and Hong Kong. The so-called ""J-beauty"" is also benefitting from an explosion of inbound tourism in recent years ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics - in particular a relaxing of visa requirements for Chinese tourists who lap up the latest Japanese cosmetic fads. Shiseido chief executive Masahiko Uotani told AFP that a focus on the high end of the market and time-honoured attention to detail set them apart from the foreign brands seeking to dominate globally. ""We are focusing on prestige, premium brands. Consumers in those categories see the value of Japanese culture,"" said Uotani. ""So strategically, we are telling consumers: those brands are from Japan, it’s Japanese R&D. And that is becoming a very important competitive value."" In addition to the new plant in Otawara, Shiseido plans to open two more in Japan before 2022 - a total investment of 120 billion yen - the fastest pace of expansion in the firm’s 150-year history. Otawara’s mayor said the plot for the new factory had been barren since the 1990 tech bubble burst. ""We used to use it to hold exercises to prepare for natural disasters,"" Tomio Tsukui explained. The 1,000 jobs it creates will make Shiseido the biggest private employer in the town, Tsukui said, putting it down to a drop in value of the yen that has made relocalising production more profitable. Norio Tadakawa, Shiseido production manager, has a different explanation. ""There are six sake breweries"" around Otawara, he says. This is due to the high-quality water around the region - also a fundamental component in making cosmetics. The three new Shiseido factories in Japan will feature the latest in Japanese tech - from advanced robotics to artificial intelligence - but will also rely heavily on human intervention, especially for the highest-range products. ""Where it’s possible we are introducing robots, AI, and digital production capacities. But we still need people, employees that have high craftmanship and skills,"" said Uotani. In Otawara for example, while machines fill the bottles, lines of employees in white, blue or pink overalls fix the tops - there are too many different types of container to automate this process. Despite the highest labour costs, Shiseido is not the only company to bring back production to its home base. In 2017, Kose Corporation sold its factory in China to boost its presence in Japan. The gamble on high-cost, high-quality domestically produced goods appears to be working, said Mitsue Konishi, senior innovation analyst at GlobalData. ""With quality ingredients, luxurious formulations, elegant packaging, and craftsmanship, cosmetics with the ’Made in Japan’ tag are gaining appeal in Asian and Western markets,"" she told AFP. But the flip side of Japanese attention to detail means development times and quality checks take longer, pointed out Shima Yamanaka, analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities. “The product timeline of Japanese companies is very long. Safety and quality are high but the product checking takes a long time,"" she told AFP. For example, Japanese firm Kao on Wednesday unveiled a ""spray-on skin"" they claim is the world’s first but that took 10 years to bring to market. Even Shiseido’s Uotani admits that the nimble South Koreans have the advantage on this front. ""They are good competitors... They are quite efficient, their development time is quite short, which allows them to be very reactive to the market,"" he said."
"""The perfume offering for the general public needs to evolve in the years to come,"" Nathalie Cetto, perfumer, Givaudan","Premium Beauty News - The My Bloom project was born under the impetus of Arnaud Guggenbuhl, Givaudan’s Global Head of Marketing Fine Fragrances, who aimed to explore new creative and olfactory horizons. Nathalie Cetto - Exactly. It all started from a study which revealed that 44% of women in France, and 50% in the US did not identify with the seduction image conveyed by the perfumes currently positioned on this segment, nor did they - on the other side of the olfactory map - with fresh waters and other sanitized fragrances. The current offering is too dichotomous, whereas these women dream of a fragrance that would talk about them and highlight their personalities. Like an extension of their own selves. Opposite transforming trails, there are perfumes that reveal an intimate part of us. As a result, Arnaud Guggenbuhl, our Marketing Fine Fragrances Director, made the NYC and Paris teams work on the idea of a reassuring perfume that would unveil a bit of us. Premium Beauty News - What did the experience actually consist in? Did you have a brief or any specific constraints? Nathalie Cetto - Not at all, we were totally free! It was definitely a new experience for us: usually, we work in collaboration with an evaluator, a sales rep… It was a valuable exercise, because we were the only ones to formulate and decide when the product was ready. It was a “personal” approach, but we could also exchange and share with the different teams at the evaluation and presentation sessions… We were given carte blanche from an olfactory standpoint, but it does not mean there were no technical constraints. Arnaud Guggenbuhl put an emphasis on the idea of fluidity and atmospheric diffusion, so we focused on heart and base notes and selected floral, woody, and musky accords… Premium Beauty News - Why such a requirement? Nathalie Cetto - Well, our work consisted in creating the opposite of a “blitz” fragrance designed to seduce as soon as the top notes emerge. On the contrary, we were guided by the idea of a perfume slowly revealing itself to wrap its wearer for the whole day. A powerful presence expressed in full transparency. These conditions require adopting a different formulation method. For a bestseller, you mainly work on top notes; here, we paid more attention to the heart and base. In a way, this writing method reflects how society has evolved. The advent of self-service distribution channels, twenty years ago, had an impact on formulation, with perfumes that seduced with their top notes, especially within a context saturated with powerful smells. It is widely known that these selective channels are now losing ground. The public favours more intimate approaches through online discovery or testing in niche stores. The way in which the system is questioned requires inventing other ways to structure fragrances. Premium Beauty News - What did the perfumers’ work result in? Nathalie Cetto  - About thirty of us took part in the project – there were 80 proposals, all in all. At the evaluation session, five main themes naturally stood out: rebirth (or resilience), self-acceptance (“self-love”), light, the skin, and transcendence (or disembodiment, in a way). About fifteen creations were eventually selected and classified by theme. Premium Beauty News - Including Romy, one of yours. Nathalie Cetto - Of course, it is a reference to actress Romy Schneider, but it is also a way to talk about me, because I accept my taste for smoking. And I think certain perfumes are more compatible than others with the smell of cigarette on the skin, hair, and clothes, so I wanted to work on this idea. I had recently come across sublime pictures of Romy Schneider lasciviously smoking during the never-completed shooting of L’Enfer, by Clouzot. It gave me inspiration for a dark, chypre, spicy, smoky, musky perfume… a very Feminine perfume both inspired from an actress and revealing the smoker in me. This fragrance was presented in the theme “self-love”. Premium Beauty News - I also remember La Disparition, an intriguing perfume… Nathalie Cetto - Absolutely, this fragrance by Marion Costéro is inspired from the eponymous novel by George Pérec. She played with raw materials she was not familiar with and which, just like the book, did not have any “E” in them. Then, she uploaded the ingredients in Carto, our AI software. The result does exhale a very peculiar sensation of absence everyone noticed in the dark, woody, smoky notes perfectly conveying the idea of disembodiment, our fifth theme. Premium Beauty News - Does this experience open new doors for creators? Nathalie Cetto - It involves other ways to compose and structure a perfume, but on the other hand, it also marks the beginning of decline for the sweet trend, to the benefit of more subtle notes, like musks. The success of For Her Pure Musk by Narciso Rodriguez or Idôle by Lancôme perfectly illustrates this evolution. These perfumes more easily create loyalty, women come back to them more easily – they are less likely to favour “zapping”. Premium Beauty News - How did the experience end? Nathalie Cetto - It ended with an “olfactory Tinder”: a dating T-shirt. We opposed seven of our creations to two benchmarks on the women’s market by asking men for their opinion about a perfumed T-shirt worn by women. Four of them won against the two references, and three won against one, which is very encouraging. To these men, the My Bloom perfumes were more mysterious and revealed a more cheerful, authentic personality. This creative method is similar to what is done in niche perfumery. That is why, the offering intended for the general public needs to evolve in the years to come. As aromatherapy is seducing an increasing number of people and new gestures are emerging, My Bloom is perfectly in line with the perfume-skincare trend. This search for fluidity and intimacy should, at last, be attractive for the Asian market."
Skincare brand Bulldog will go on sale in mainland China while retaining cruelty-free status,"Mainland China requires beauty products to be tested on animals by law, making it impossible for brands to retail in the region and retain cruelty-free credentials. However, Bulldog - which boasts a Leaping Bunny status awarded by Cruelty Free International - is taking part in a special project launched by Cruelty Free International in cooperation with Knudsen & CRC, Shanghai Fengpu Industrial Park and Oriental Beauty Valley. The agreement means that Bulldog products will not face animal testing in China, but will instead have their formulas manufactured in the UK, before the product is filled in the the Fengxian manufacturing zone, south of Shanghai. ""We are delighted to see one of our Leaping Bunny-approved companies come through the pilot project to successfully enter the Chinese market,"" said Michelle Thew, CEO of Cruelty Free International, in a statement. ""Huge congratulations to Bulldog for showing commitment and leading the way. We know there is great demand from consumers in China for cruelty-free cosmetics. This is an amazing opportunity not only for Bulldog, but for consumers in China and for the future of the whole beauty industry."" ""Even with the temptation of the huge Chinese market, we decided that we would never compromise our stance on animal testing,"" added Bulldog Skincare founder Simon Duffy. ""It is fantastic that this scheme has allowed us to enter mainland China while maintaining our cruelty-free status. We hope the success of this scheme will pave the way for more international cruelty-free brands to sell there."" The cruelty-free movement has been gaining traction in the beauty industry in recent years, with several major beauty brands eliminating animal testing from their practices. These include the Unilever-owned skincare and haircare giant Dove, which was awarded cruelty-free status by PETA last year, and the Coty brand Covergirl, which received the same status from Cruelty Free International last November."
"""Brazil is a country that is extremely important for L’Oréal Group’s strategy,"" Patrick Sabatier from L’Oréal Brazil","Premium Beauty News - L’Oréal is celebrating its 60th year in Brazil. How important is the country for L’Oréal Group? Patrick Sabatier - Brazil is the fourth largest beauty market in the world, the second in fragrances and third in hair colouring and sun protection. We have been in Brazil for 60 years, sharing beauty with our consumers. When it comes to beauty, Brazilian women are the most demanding in the world. All of this makes Brazil a country that is extremely important for L’Oréal Group’s strategy. Premium Beauty News - Brazil is a very diverse country. There are different types of hair and an even larger variety of skin types. How is it to work in a market like this? Patrick Sabatier - It is a challenge and, at the same time, a big opportunity. Brazil is an open laboratory due to its diversity, and the country has a key role in the cosmetics market. In our country, we have eight types of hair that are listed by L’Oréal, from the straightest to the most curled. Brazilian women have the most complicated hair routine in the world: they use five different products every day, while French women use three on average. Out of the 66 skin tones registered by L’Oréal, 55 can be found in Brazil. This ethnic and cultural diversity has inspired L’Oréal for 60 years. That is why we have invested in research in the country for over 10 years and, two years ago, we opened a Research and Innovation Center in Rio de Janeiro - our only center in Latin America and one of the six L’Oréal research hubs in the world. It confirms our long-term commitment to Brazil and it allows us to quickly launch innovations that Brazilian consumers desire, potentially launching them globally. It also allows us to adapt global innovations to Brazilian consumers.
 
Premium Beauty News - Four business divisions of L’Oréal are in Brazil. Is there any that stand out with best-selling products? Patrick Sabatier - We have performances and innovations that stand out in every single one of the four business divisions in Brazil. There are 20 iconic multi-category brands, for every hair, skin and beauty type. The Active Cosmetics division leads the market of dermocosmetics with brands like La Roche-Posay, Vichy, Skinceuticals and Cerave. In the Consumer Products division, I highlight our iconic brand L’Oréal Paris. The brand kick-started our journey in Brazil in 1959 with Imédia Cream, a hair dye that is popular among women to this day. We also have Niely, a national brand with over 30 million consumers that aims to make beauty care more democratic. In our Luxe division we grew strongly - two digits - in a very competitive market thanks to brands such as Lancôme, Giorgio Armani, Ralph Lauren and Yves Saint Laurent. In this sector, we lead in female perfumery with Lancôme’s La Vie et Belle and we recently launched Idôle - from the same brand - that has been selling well. Finally, there is the Professional Products division, with L’Oréal Professional, Kérastase and Redken. Redken was a brand built through the relationship with beauty salons and it now has an omni-channel strategy - going from beauty salons, to e-commerce platforms and kiosks in shopping malls. Premium Beauty News - Among L’Oréal’s innovations in the country is the launch of Episkin. How will it work? Patrick Sabatier - Episkin is already fully operational in our Research and Innovation Center in Rio de Janeiro. In September, in order to contribute to making alternative methods a reality in Brazil, we opened the Brazilian subsidiary of Episkin. The brand is a world leader in reconstructed skin. We then made this innovation available to other companies in Brazil, so they can assess the safety and efficiency of new ingredients and products without testing on animals. Premium Beauty News - The company is also investing in a plant in São Paulo. What is the goal? Patrick Sabatier - L’Oréal Brazil is investing so it can have a 4.0 industry in São Paulo, with digitalizing, automation, augmented reality technology and artificial intelligence to optimize the production process. Together with our global program Sharing Beauty With All, we are also investing in our plant’s sustainability. We currently buy 100% of our electricity from renewable sources for all of our locations in Brazil. The next step is to install solar energy panels in our São Paulo plant, just like we did with our Research and Innovation Center in Rio de Janeiro."
Coty takes controlling stake in Kylie Cosmetics for USD 600 million,"The USD 600 million deal will give Coty ""overall responsibility for the portfolio’s development, leveraging its global knowledge and capabilities in R&D, manufacturing, distribution, commercial and go-to-market expertise, as well as its deep understanding of the fragrances, cosmetics and skincare categories,"" according to a press release. It is a major milestone for Jenner, who made her entry into the beauty arena back in 2015 with the launch of what was then ‘Lip Kits by Kylie’ and was renamed Kylie Cosmetics the following year. The brand has made an estimated USD 177 million in net revenues over the past 12 months. Named third most influential global beauty personality in a recent study from Cosmetify, Kylie Jenner counts 151 million followers on Instagram, making her one of the world’s 10 most followed personalities of the social network, together with soccer player Christiano Ronaldo, singer Ariana Grande or her older sister Kim Kardashian. Her strong presence on social networks has greatly contributed to the success of her brand. The move will see Jenner and Coty work to transform the business into a ""global powerhouse brand,"" with a focus on global expansion and entry into new beauty categories. According to Coty, Kylie and her team will continue to lead all creative efforts in terms of product and communications initiatives, building on her unrivalled global reach capabilities through social media. Coty will have overall responsibility for the brand’s category expansions, such as skin care, fragrance and nail products, leveraging its capabilities in R&D, manufacturing, distribution, commercial and go-to-market expertise. “This new partnership between Kylie and Coty is an exciting step in Coty’s renewed emphasis on its beauty business. Kylie is a modern-day icon, with an incredible sense of the beauty consumer, and we believe in the high potential of building a global beauty brand together,” said Peter Harf, Chairman of the Board, in a statement. The deal came at a time when Coty has met some difficulties in integrating the assets of its recent acquisitions, including those related to the take-over of Procter & Gamble’s beauty businesses in 2015 for USD 12.5 billion. Coty recently announced its intention to refocus on its fragrances, cosmetics and skin care through the divestment of its professional beauty business and its activities in Brazil."
Reload: The Brazilian brand that wants to change the game in beauty packaging,"“A plastic bottle takes 600 years to decompose at sea, but we use it for no longer than just 20 minutes,” says Teodoro Bava, Commercial Director at Reload Beleza Positiva. The Brazilian cosmetics company is the first in the world to reuse mineral water bottles to package its haircare products. “We came up with this idea while assessing how products are currently consumed and disposed of,” adds Bava. The company was first launched in 2013 but underwent a complete overhaul last year and now focuses heavily on sustainability. “We repositioned Reload to challenge old, unsustainable market models and provide a new option for consumers who are concerned about their health and the environment,” says Bava. Reload thus collaborated with mineral water company Água Mineral São Lourenço. They proceeded to map out the establishments where Água Mineral São Lourenço’s products are sold, such as bars, hotels and restaurants, and later started collecting disposed water bottles from them directly. The company then developed and patented a new sanitizing technique to clean all collected bottles, which are then reused to package Reload’s products. At the moment, only two products in the company’s portfolio are sold packaged in reused water bottles - a shampoo and a conditioner. Both of these products are all-natural and vegan, as well as sulphate- and parabens-free with an exclusive fragrance developed by Givaudan. Prices vary between R$ 60 to R$ 70 (about 14 and 17 US dollars) for 300ml bottles, putting them in the high-end category in Brazil. “With this launch, we were able to confirm Brazilian consumers’ willingness to pay more for a product that has high performance, but is environmentally friendly.” The shampoo and conditioner, as well as a kit containing both products, are available for purchase at Reload’s e-commerce website. Bava says that the company is currently in negotiations with gyms, natural product stores and beauty salons that share the company’s values, meaning its products. For instance, the company’s products were recently launched in some Mundo Verde stores in São Paulo. “We will also include a company display at each of these locations so that consumers can correctly dispose of Reload’s product packaging,” explains Bava. “The bottles will be put through the sanitization process again, being reused once more after the process is completed. Should the packaging be damaged in any way, it will be sent to a recycling facility.” Reload does not intend to limit this new offering to two products and is looking to scale up things. “We have exciting projects to launch new products and lines, all of which will be packaged in reused bottles,” explains Teodoro Bava. “This model is at the core of Reload and we refuse to change the way we are. We have entered this new market to show we must rethink production and consumerism.”"
Natura wants to grow globally while maintaining its sustainable ethos,"For João Paulo Ferreira, the group’s CEO, one of the main reasons for Natura’s success lies in Brazil’s huge biodiversity, particularly in the Amazon region, where the group has forged partnerships with local communities to extract natural essences.  ""The Amazon is a global heritage. We are lucky to benefit from it as a large part of the forest is in Brazil,"" said the leader, who received AFP at the group’s headquarters, near São Paulo, the economic capital of the country. Natura ""has shown that it is possible to combine economic progress with the protection of the environment,"" said Ferreira. Such remarks are far from being innocuous in a country widely divided by the environmental policy of President Jair Bolsonaro. This notorious climate sceptic has provoked much controversy because of its intention to promote the expansion of agribusiness and mining activities in the Amazon, where deforestation and fires have increased sharply in recent months. ""Let’s hope that when this moment of polarization is behind us, we will succeed in fostering dialogue"" between government, landowners, traditional communities and NGOs, Ferreira adds. Natura’s head considers the activities of the company have contributed to protect 1.8 million hectares in the Amazon region, ""almost half of the entire surface of the Netherlands."" As an example, Mr Ferreira points ucuuba, the fruit of an Amazonian tree also known as baboonwood or wild nutmeg (Virola surinamensis), which is part of many of the group’s products. According to the CEO, picking this fruit has tripled the income of local communities, without cutting any tree. ""It shows that it is possible to create wealth from the forest while leaving it standing,"" he insists. According Paulo Branco, a researcher at the Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV), ""Natura faces a constant dilemma: how to continue with a strategy of growth while respecting the ecosystems and local communities?” Mr Branco considers that Natura is ""a pioneering company"" in Brazil. Natura’s founder, Luis Seabra, opened his first store in 1969, and the group took off on a direct sales model. Today, the Natura&Co group is established in 73 countries, with 32,000 employees around the world, including 6,600 in Brazil. In 2018, the group achieved a turnover of 13.4 billion Brazilian réais (approximately USD 3.7 billion at the annual average conversion rate), an increase of 35% compared to the previous year. Net profit, however, fell by 18% to 584.4 million réais, mainly due to the absorption of the debt of UK’s The Body Shop, that Natura took over in 2017. In May, Natura acquired Avon, another iconic brand originating from the United States. Once this transaction is approved by the shareholders of both groups and by the anti-trust authorities, Natura&Co will become the world’s fourth largest seller of cosmetic products, lagging just behind France’s L’Oréal, US’s Procter & Gamble and the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate Unilever. This expansion was welcomed by investors at São Paulo’s Stock Exchange where the share price of the Brazilian group is currently twice as high as one year ago. ""Ten years ago, 95% of our business was in Brazil. But during this decade, we have experienced strong growth in Latin America and a third of our sales now take place outside Brazil,"" highlighted the CEO, who does not hide his ambition to transform its company into a leading global player."
Polo Tecnologico della Cosmesi: An Innovation Day dedicated to sustainability,"Premium Beauty News - Why do you think this new edition will stand as a real turning point for your association? Matteo Moretti - First of all, because of its growing success! Last year’s edition really exceeded our expectations and now we can feel it’s a real dynamic that is building up over the months. This also obviously explains the rising number of members to our association. And this year’s conferences programme, that we recently released, is already a huge success in the entire cosmetic sector both in Italy and abroad. Among the highlights, the presence of several high-profile personalities from major brands such as L’Oréal, Coty, Sephora. A day dedicated to the environment, where the emphasis will be placed on the major challenges that await the packaging and formulation industries. Premium Beauty News - Your Association has nothing to compare with in the world! Matteo Moretti - That’s true! To my knowledge, we are the only Association in the world that represents only the cosmetic industry, ""industrially speaking"", from the design stage to the manufacture of machines and of cosmetic formulas including packaging, accessories, etc. Most of the other organizations also integrate the downstream part of the sector, i.e. Brands and Distribution. However, I think it is important for this industrial sector that we represent, to retain its autonomy and independence, while collaborating, of course, very closely with all of its customers. Premium Beauty News - Will you take advantage of this 4th edition of the Innovation Day to present new projects? Matteo Moretti - What is important for an association like ours, aside from the truly significant relational benefit our members can draw from, are the other ""services"" that the Polo della Cosmesi must also propose. We are not a big association which implies, among other things, a number of budgetary constraints. We must find solutions which are consistent with the means at our disposal and, as much as possible, develop these means. And everyone knows that unity is strength. This is why we have, for example, entered into discussions to reach a cooperation agreement with another French association very similar to ours in its functioning and its economic approach: the Cosmed, and this, concerning several areas, particularly on the regulatory field. Our event of October 29 will be the opportunity to describe its key aspects. Premium Beauty News - Any other plans for 2020? Matteo Moretti - Yes, of course! It is most likely that our annual event will take place in another venue. Probably in Milan..., and this with other partners. We also intend to be much more present in terms communication with the creation of a new website supported by a series of regular newsletters. We also plan to organize more themed meetings and not just in Italy. Information and registration: www.poloinnovationday.com"
In memory of Hubert Varlet: “A Great Man!”," It is impossible to not remember Hubert Varlet! He was born on February 27, 1946 in Paris. After graduating from Sup de Co Paris and Insead, he met Michèle, whom he married in 1969 before leaving for the Ivory Coast the following year to do his military service. In 1971 he joined the export department of the BSN Group and later became Commercial Director of the Bottle Division. He stayed in office twenty years. 1971 is also the year when, the Pochet Group, under the impulse of the two sons of Charles Colonna de Giovellina, Henri and Jean, dared take the shift of modernity by deciding to build, in the French site of Guimerville, a fully automated line for the production of glass bottles. The investment represented at the time, one year of turnover.  The encounter between the Colonna family and Hubert Varlet eventually took place 14 years later. Hence in 1985, the Colonna family who had immediately recognized the exceptional commercial skills of this man with a strong personality all agreed on the fact they had to convince Hubert to join the Pochet team. This was done a few months later on October 1st, 1985! Thereafter, the story of the Pochet Group is the proof that they were right. From this complicity and complementarity emerged, exponentially, with the support of a team of motivated collaborators and technicians, what became the world reference for luxury bottles. Hubert Varlet stay in the Group for 27 years and ""Uncle Hubert"" will in no time become a member of the family. In 50 years, he will have worked for two companies only... ""It was certainly the finest example of sheer commercial talent one could dream of,"" explained Irène Gosset, now President of the Group and daughter of Henri Colonna de Giovellina. ""Relentlessly, Hubert travelled the world and build, as only he knew how, very close and personal relationships with customers. He and Gabriel Colonna, son of Henri, who joined the Group in 1983 will form a winning pair. Many customers who knew him well admitted that it was a real privilege to do business with him"". In a nutshell, ""he had the knack for relationships!"" ""What was fantastic about him, was his ability to not talk straightforwardly with a customer of the reason why he was actually visiting him, (i.e., to sell him bottles), but to focus more on the evolution of the global market and of the retail sector that he knew like the back of his hand. He spoke on an equal footing with the Presidents of the world’s leading beauty brands. But, in the end, he sold much more than just bottles. He was promoting the Pochet Group and its excellence. He knew the market better than anyone,"" was keen to point out Thierry de la Fléchère, former Sales Manager for France. During these 27 years of collaboration, the Pochet Group changed a lot. The strategy of internationalization, focused more particularly on the United States, Brazil and Asia, and which was initiated by the Colonna family as early as the 1970s, was quickly taken over and managed by Hubert Varlet. Hence the Group entered the very closed circle of world glassmakers capable of achieving the most astonishing prowess and of taking up the biggest technical challenges. Challenges that no one was afraid of in the Group, including of course Hubert. He was also instrumental in Pochet’s decision to diversify in 1991 in the plastic processing sector with the creation of Qualipac, and by reinforcing this business unit through additional acquisitions or creations, such as Priminter, Qualipac’s two Chinese sites, Qualiform, IPEL in Brazil, Lisi Cosmetics. ""But on the other hand, being late at a meeting was not an option and even less of having not worked sufficiently on the agenda of the meeting. No one was more punctual and demanding than Hubert!  He always wanted to get to the bottom of things and he had the knack for saying the right words at the right time,” clearly remembered Thierry de la Fléchère. ""In terms of interpersonal skills, Hubert was the king! He was flamboyant!  But he knew how to put himself in the position of his interlocutors,"" explained Isabelle Lallemant, Group Marketing and Innovation Director. ""I remember the day when we received an award at Luxe Pack Monaco for our CSR approach. He managed to convincingly talked Prince Albert of Monaco into visiting the stand of the Group he then immediately took him to."" ""Unquestionably, he impressed people with his charisma,"" highlighted Astrid Rutkowski Mauduit who spent some 17 years in the Pochet Group before creating her own cosmetic brand.  ""What was striking about him was that he could be both very demanding and benevolent with his colleagues. A commercial meeting with Hubert always took the form of a ritual gathering where personal failure was not an option. But his great strength was also his ability to listen to his colleagues and of course to customers.” ""Eventually ‘Hubert was very Pochet’ or it was ‘Pochet who was very Hubert’. As you know, Customer Commitment became one of the Group’s four cardinal virtues.  We have made it a strategic priority for our development,” said Irène Gosset, President of the Group. ""The history of Pochet is one of unwavering commitment for the success of our customers. It cannot be denied that it is under his impetus that we now have a customer-centric organization, with a dense network of contact points thanks to which we are able to meet very different requests by providing tailor-made answers."" Concerning the Pochet Group’s other cardinal virtues, which are described at length in its corporate charter, and can fully apply to Hubert Varlet... That of Excellence first, with a capital ""E"" where Hubert Varlet, like the Group, made a point of standing out through the absolute quality of its achievements and the uniqueness of its know-how, at the crossroads of art and industry. That of Customer Commitment, which we already talked about. That of Consideration, which is a strong term, it’s a mixture of respect, esteem and benevolence that reflects our vision of the Group and of the world. Aware that the Group owes its success to the involvement of everyone, Hubert Varlet, like the Group, wanted employees to feel listened to, and valued in their work. So he left us on a 1st of August. There were many people attending the Mass given in his memory, end of September in Paris, France."
Sand & Sky: The A-Beauty pioneer brand who is taking the world by storm,"Inspired from the Australian way of life, A-Beauty could be defined as “beauty made in nature, not the lab”. It is effortless beauty that starts with great skin with at its heart the natural ingredients that are unique to Australia: Pink Clay, Kakadu Plum, Finger Lime just to name a few. It echoes the “clean beauty” trend as formulas are usually free from “nasties” and natural where possible. A-beauty is about easy-to-use products and fuss-free routines that deliver visible results, fast. Witnessing a growing hunger for all things Australian, twin sisters Sarah and Emily Hamilton had a simple goal: to put A-Beauty on the map. They set about creating an Australian botanical skincare brand that worked, while embodying the legendary Aussie laidback lifestyle and fun-loving personality. The result is Sand & Sky, launched in April 2017 with a now-cult, even sold-out last year, Australian Pink Clay Porefining Face Mask. Sarah explains: ""The detoxifying powers of clay are well known, and we knew that we wanted to start with an Australian-made clay mask. Our Head of Product, Sam, went on a bush medicine course in Alice Springs and learned so much about native Australian ingredients and their benefits. She explained the power of Australian Pink Clay, alongside the purity of the Australian environment and these gorgeous ingredients - like Kakadu Plum and Old Man’s Weed, would push results beyond typical clay masks. And our testing process showed immediate results that backed this up"". Sand & Sky avoids crazy claims, indecipherable ingredients list, and 10-step regimes. The brand aims at keeping things as simple as possible with effective, clean and easy-and-lovely-to-use Australian botanical products that give a holiday skin. “Our collective experience in living in New York, London, Berlin and Basel told us that the international audience wanted natural products produced in pristine environments, most specifically, Australia,” says Sarah Hamilton. Claimed to be sourced from “the purest environment on earth”, and combined with a series of Australian botanical ingredients, Australian Pink Clay has been designed to “absorb dirt and impurities, drawing out toxins and combating pollution,” in order to “restore the skin’s natural defence shield and instantly shrink and refine pores” while being “gentle on sensitive skin” and “non-drying.” “We’ve seen first-hand how the Aussie accent immediately paints a picture of sandy hair, glowing skin and life by the beach... That all seems like a great way to live, and a perfect
cocktail when creating an effective and fun product,” states Emily Hamilton. The success of Sand & Sky contributed to accelerate the growth of A-Beauty in the global skincare market. Two years after its creation, the brand has become the leading direct-to-consumer A-beauty brand and has built an impressive and engaged community of 480,000 followers across social medias."
China: Pechoin or the resounding return of a sleeping beauty,"Pechoin has come a long way. The brand founded in 1931 in Shanghai, handicapped by a dated image, nearly disappeared from the market. Today, the Chinese business magazine Cyzone (创业 邦) ranks it first in the list of China’s heritage brands (across all categories) with annual sales estimated to 17.7 billion yuan (2.26 billion euros). Advertising has been a particularly effective lever for repositioning the brand. In 2017, Pechoin launched an animated digital series for people to follow on their phones, staging an elegant Shanghainese female spy on a secret mission in 1931. In the same spirit of empowerment, the commercial Four Angry Beauties recounted, in a humorous tone, the rebellion of women breaking the codes of imperial China. ""Pechoin’s campaigns are deeply rooted in Chinese history, triggering strong emotional resonance among consumers,"" analysed the Cyzone magazine. In early 2019, Pechoin launched a joint operation with Hey Tea, a young Chinese chain store specialized in tea (including cheese tea and fresh fruit tea), on the theme ""The Republic of China (1912-1946)"". The aesthetics and climate of the time inspired more particular the creation of Hey Tea x Pechoin gift sets, as well as special menus in Hey Tea boutiques. Decorated with phonographs and old trunks, a bus in the colours of the operation welcomed visitors in a setting recalling the nostalgic atmosphere of old Shanghai. Currently very common in China, this inter-sectoral collaboration, did not lead this time to the creation of a new product, as was the case with the Milk Candy Flavoured Lip Balm from the heritage brand White Rabbit, a result of its partnership with the Chinese skincare brand Maxam. Pechoin has also managed to take advantage of Chinese shopping festivals, among which, the Singles Day on November 11, launched by the Chinese Internet giant Alibaba, by leveraging on KOLs (Key Opinion Leader) specialized in beauty. ""These influencers were chosen for their ability to ’zhongcao’ (种草). This term, which means ’planting the seed of an idea in the mind of the consumer’ is currently very popular among Chinese marketers,"" explained the Chinese marketing agency ParkLu. These KOLs posted videos of them testing Pechoin products while sharing their first impressions. These actions enabled Pechoin to be the best-selling cosmetic brand at the Singles Days 2018. ""127 KOLs referred to Pechoin, reaching a spectre of 143 million followers, leading to more than 160,000 engagements on online platforms such as Weitao, Weibo, WeChat, Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book), and Douyin,"" ParkLu reported. According to the agency, by working with KOLs, Pechoin succeeded in transforming its image and win over young consumers, thus establishing a case study for other ageing brands seeking to reinvent themselves. On the lookout for trendy concepts, the brand launched new beauty masks ""’Little moments of joy"" (小 确 幸). In a context marked by strong growth in men’s products (+51% in 2018 on the Tmall platform, which coined the era ""Male Beauty Era""), the offer also included a Pechoin Men’s line. Pechoin also launched limited series of a box in the traditional Chinese style designed by Zhong Hua, Chief Designer at the Oriental Royal Jewellery located in the Forbidden City. ""The success of Pechoin shows the growing confidence of Chinese consumers in local brands,"" commented ParkLu. It also takes place in a context of declining attractiveness for Korean products, especially among younger generations. A trend that benefits Pechoin, known for its use of traditional Chinese plant-based ingredients. ""Beauty product addicts aged between 18 and 22 are particularly proud of buying Chinese brands,"" highlighted the South China Morning Post. The newspaper owned by the Alibaba Group refers to the study of the Business Intelligence Institute Gartner L2, according to which in December 2018, 72% of Chinese brands used the keyword Made in China in their list of products sold on the Tmall platform, against less than 50% the year before. Does Pechoin have projects outside China? Its recent membership to the International Federation of Societies of Cosmetic Chemists (IFSCC) could be an indication pointing in that direction. Moreover the IFSCC awarded the 2019 Maison G de Navarre Young Scientist Award to Yan Liu, chemist at Pechoin, for his work on the skin microbiome."
Roos & Roos keeps growing and unveils new fragrance,"Premium Beauty News - Why change the brand name? And why Roos & Roos? Chantal Roos - We had chosen the name of Dear Rose as a way to keep telling new stories, because to us, “Rose” both refers to a first name and a mythical flower. The problem was, customers thought all our fragrances were based on rose, when they were not. It could be confusing and disappointing, so we decided to review our story. And what regularly stood out from customer insights was that our brand was marked by femininity. Two women, mother and daughter, with both complicity and differences, a complementary vision with a contemporary touch – that is not so common on the market. And it is really our point of difference. So, the brand became Roos & Roos. Premium Beauty News - So, what is Roos & Roos today? Chantal Roos - Roos & Roos is composed of the original range of five 100 ml Eaux de parfum for which we have just launched the 50 ml size. There is also the Exclusifs range – still created with perfumer-creator Fabrice Pellegrin, of Firmenich –, a line of six fragrances which goes even farther in our search of raw materials and sophisticated packaging designed by artists. Also, we have just launched two new Oud-based perfumes to meet demand from the Middle East, a market on which the brand is already successful. Lastly, the new fragrance named Pale Blue Eyes, as a reference to the mythical hit by The Velvet Underground, was created by Dominique Ropion and will be launched in late September. It is both radiant and sensual. Premium Beauty News - What is the brand’s main strength? Chantal Roos - We have been working with a perfumer-creator as part of our constant search for new raw materials, which we systematically combine with others, and for new ideas. For example, we won a Fifi Award for the Mentha Religiosa fragrance, a most surprising, innovative association of peppermint and patchouli & incense as base notes. Our strength also lies in how we work, in what both of us bring to the other, depending on her experiences. Alexandra is very creative, she is an artist. For example, she is the one who found the names of our fragrances, often in relation to her musical world. She can move me out of my comfort zone, out of my story. It is a mother-daughter duo; it is not always that easy. She had to find her own place, and I had to learn to say “you’re right, I got it wrong”. Premium Beauty News - Beyond products, what are your next developments, export-wise? Chantal Roos - We launched a fundraising campaign a year ago, which helped us increase our workforce and recruit a sales manager to get global. So, we have just entered several markets in the Middle East, in Qatar, Kuwait, Lebanon, Dubai, and Saudi Arabia. We are also present in Europe through distributors in Italy, Switzerland, Germany, the UK…We have ongoing projects in the US and we are expanding in Russia, where we had already partly settled via the L’Etoile niche brand points of sale. And of course, our fragrances are available in France, at the Bon Marché department store, as well as in a beautiful selection of niche perfume stores. The other big investment is aimed to gain fame, which will depend on the work done by our people locally, in every country, with the press, in social media, etc. In some countries, our distributors have their own press attachés. In the others, we recruited them. The Web is also an issue on which we have been working – our website has already much evolved. Premium Beauty News - Given your experience, how do you view conventional perfumery compared to niche perfumery, which you chose with Roos & Roos? Chantal Roos - At the time of my first launches with Yves Saint Laurent, Opium or Paris, for example, there were only few launches and distribution only involved perfume retailers and a few department stores. Then, distribution changed a lot, as chains like Sephora and Marionnaud emerged, and brands created an increasing number of new fragrances. We can almost talk about overabundance, perfumes tended to smell like one another, and as soon as the 2000s, women turned to what was soon called niche perfumery. Now, the risk is that too many niche brands may emerge, but as usual, consumers are those who choose, especially given the growing influence of websites. Fragrance Innovation Summit Chantal Roos will share her expérience and vision of the fragrance market during the Fragrance Innovation Summit, on 7th November 2019 in Paris.

Anjac Health & Beauty sets up in North America with the acquisition of Cosmetix West,"Anjac Health & Beauty continues its offensive external growth strategy and consolidates its cosmetics offer. The Californian company could be a key asset for the French group to expand in several growth markets, including Clean Beauty. ""We are pleased to expand our know-how in such a dynamic and influential region for our key markets. Great opportunities and synergies are opening up to the Group,” said Aurélien Chaufour, General Manager of Anjac Health & Beauty. The business of Cosmetix West (about US$40 million in 2018), which develops skincare products for numerous indie and historic brands in North America, allows Anjac Health & Beauty to strengthen its position in the cosmetics and dermo-cosmetics sectors, in addition to the offer of the group’s other entities in this sector: Sicaf, Shadeline, Eurowipes and Feltor Laboratories. This acquisition also provides the group with new opportunities to expand its product offer to address new consumer expectations that have become essential for cosmetic brands, such as Clean Beauty - in other words, transparent, minimalist and efficient cosmetic solutions that emphasize naturalness - as well as men’s grooming, or Japanese-inspired cosmetics known as ""J-Beauty"". Located in the Los Angeles area, Cosmetix West has acquired an extensive know-how in the formulation, development, manufacture and filling of skin, hair care and hygiene products and fragrances, developed in various galenics. Thanks to its capacity to innovate and adapt, the company has been able to attract many major indie brands to its customers line up. This is the fifth acquisition in less than two years for Anjac Health & Beauty. This external development strategy allowed the group to double its turnover between 2016 and 2019. Anjac Health & Beauty now includes ten companies and 14 R&D and production sites in the fields of health, hygiene, beauty and nutritional supplements: Innovi, Chemineau, Feltor Laboratories, Shadeline, SICAF, LPEV, Euro Wipes, Aircos, Pascual Cosmetics, and Cosmetix West, for a turnover of 280 million euros expected in 2019."
Aircos is structuring itself and sets course for North America,"Recognized above all for its expertise in the manufacture and packaging of make-up powders (free, compacted or multi-compacted powders, or back-injected powders), Aircos has seen its sales jump from 13.5 million euros in 2015 to 25 million (forecast) in 2019. A performance linked, according to Thomas Sirot, Commercial Director, to ""the success met by the formulas designed in-house, in particular powders developed thanks to our IPM [1] back-injection technology, which allows obtaining a new generation of formulas, which are a lot more creamier and with a high content of nacres, but also to the concomitant opening of new export markets"". Today, exports account for 47% of the company’s sales (mainly to the United States and the Middle East). The company offers its customers operating mainly in premium and luxury segments, eye and complexion products, blushes, bronzers and also body powders, but Aircos also knows how to hot-fill lipsticks, glosses and concealers, using formulas made by partners. To meet a challenging growth, Aircos integrated, at the end of 2017, the Anjac Health & Beauty Group and invested both heavily in its production tool with, in 2018, a 50% increase in the size of its make-up site in Romorantin, dedicated to the manufacture of powders, and in the construction of controlled atmosphere rooms, not to mention the acquisition of new equipment for the Ardon site, near Orléans, more specifically dedicated to packaging production. ""Today we have a fleet of 35 injection machines. We mostly manufacture custom products, but due to high demand, we are starting to offer standard products in ready-to go mini formats. We are actually going to expand our standard offer to better meet the expectations of brands,"" specified Thomas Sirot. In total, more than 6.5 million euros have been invested over the last three years (2017, 2018, 2019) mainly in new equipment and for the plant expansion, with the aim of obtaining the ISO 22716 certification (Good Manufacturing Practices in Cosmetics) in the first quarter of 2020. To note that the company currently has two R&D laboratories, one in Paris, focused on innovation, and the other in Romorantin, which specializes in the industrialization of new formulas. ""We are investing heavily in formulas. At the level of Aircos and of the Anjac Health & Beauty Group, where Innovation Committees meet suppliers, share their information on raw materials, on processes,"" emphasised Thomas Sirot. ""We recently launched, under the name Crystal Fusion, formulas mixing creamy and matte textures, as well as matte powder bases with a very strong metallic pay-off"". The teams were also beefed up with the arrival of Philippe Proust, (formerly Sanofi), who took over the management of the Romorantin plant in November 2018, of Nathalie Soulard, who was appointed Supply Chain Manager in February 2019, and of Éric Hoisnard, former Nuxe Packaging Development Director and who was appointed Project Development Manager in January. Finally, to meet the expectations of the marketplace, Aircos has engaged since mid-2018 in a CSR approach led by Frédéric Lancesseur, CEO of the company. A strategy structured around three pillars : More sustainable products, a positive contribution to the territories, and the development of employees. “In a context clearly oriented towards naturalness, the creation of more sustainable products is undeniably a key strategy. This involves a sustainable purchasing policy, a ’clean formulation’ offer based on an Aircos list inspired by the Cosmos label. We can also offer natural formulas to customers wishing to go one step further in the area. In our laboratories, we master and adjust the level of naturalness in our formulas, as of the conception stages. We are also focusing on the eco-design of our products and packaging,"" detailed Thomas Sirot. At a time when brands, especially young emerging and promising start-ups in North America, rely more and more on their suppliers but with rising levels of requirements, the integration of Aircos in the Anjac Health & Beauty Group has helped consolidate investment capabilities and meet the challenges of a rapidly growing market along with a strong international development. Next stage? ""A sales office backed by new production resources in North America,"" revealed Thomas Sirot.  More information on the above will probably be disclosed at the upcoming MakeUp in New York trade show, next September 11 and 12, 2019, where Aircos will present its new products to its American customers."
"pH fragrances: ""Towards a premium and clean perfumery""","""We are positioning ourselves as the first Luxury and Clean perfume brand in France,"" explains Camille Le Feuvre, founder and President of pH fragrances, a young niche brand created in December 2018. The brand currently proposes a line of eight fragrances developed exclusively with Givaudan and available as eaux de parfum (15ml and 100ml and boxes), candles and detergents. A range of products for the body (deodorants, shower gels, body creams) is in preparation. ""What we had in mind was to offer a complete universe made of exceptional fragrances which could be found in every day to day products,"" says Camille Le Feuvre. To state its difference regarding its societal and ecological approach, pH fragrances adopted ultra-restrictive specifications in terms of formulation, which the brand has imposed to all its suppliers across all product categories. ""We have banned all ingredients regarded as toxic, harmful, controversial, both in the personal care and home care lines,"" confirms Camille Le Feuvre. Overall, the brand has selected “the finest qualities of naturals and perfume ingredients, as respectful as possible to the environment and human health.” However, because natural substances were favoured, not all allergens could be removed from the products, while remaining of course within the regulatory framework. For each application (fragrances, candles, detergents, deodorants, creams, shower gels) specific requirements, more stringent than the regulations in force, were also defined. Thus, phenoxyethanol, SLS, SLES, BHT, BHA, formaldehyde ... have been banned from the personal care formulas. Finally, for candles and detergents, the aim was to present ""clean labels"", that is to say: with no warnings or risk pictograms such as: ""environment hazard"", ""health hazard""; no labelling such as: ""may lead or cause long-term adverse effects"", or ""toxic to aquatic life"". Warnings, which are actually not found on cosmetic packagings, which fall under another regulation, but whose total elimination is a first for home care products. ""Of course, with respect to this level of innovation, it was impossible to use catalogue formulas. We had to start from scratch. More than two years of Research and Development were required to reach this level of innovation,"" explains Camille Le Feuvre. Especially since the brand only wanted to use a single formula for each of the eight fragrances in the range, regardless of the medium for which it was intended. ""Only choosing to rely on a single and unique scented oil for each fragrance in the personal care range and one oil for the home care range was a real technical feat and a major environmental plus"". This innovative approach will also be used as part of the future concept store. In addition to its policy in terms of drastic selection of ingredients, the brand is also very committed at the environmental and societal level. ""The ingredients in each of our eight fragrances were also selected according to their level of sustainability. We focused more particularly on Givaudan’s Orpur® ingredients, the finest of ingredients collected in an ethical and responsible way"". On the manufacturing side, pH fragrances chose local sourcing by working with 20 industrial partners based in the Paris region and in the south of France. ""Everything is ""Made in France"", including the packagings,"" insists the founder. ""We refuse to use plastic for our cases and packagings, because there is already too much plastic scattered everywhere on the planet and we want to place the emphasis on the products"". The tinted glass bottles pay tribute to the bottles traditionally used in perfumery, while protecting formulas that do not contain UV filters. The range has a very sleek design, in keeping with the apothecary trend, which reflects the care taken in the selection of ingredients. The brand, which is already sold in concept stores, in particular at Nous (previously Colette), in Paris, Geneva, Saint-Tropez, and soon Miami and Dubai, was also introduced to Parisian customers in the pop-up store La Fabrique, in the Paris Marais district, where it was met with great success, according to the designer. ""The customer feedback is excellent, 95% of people who smell our perfumes buy them. The Givaudan teams have managed to overcome these highly restrictive specifications, and achieve an outstanding technical and olfactory feat. The eight fragrances with eight different olfactory directions are of exceptional quality,"" she concludes. The brand now aims to develop itself in the United States, where the clean trend is very strong and, well beyond beauty, extends to the entire lifestyle; hence the brand intends to open its own concept store, where customers will be able to create, on the spot, their own products. Our architects have already drawn up the plans, now we need to find the right location... and investors! Fragrance Innovation Summit Camille Le Feuvre will introduce the pH Fragrance brand and concept at the next Fragrance Innovation Summit in Paris, on November 7, 2019.

Start-up: Be + Radiance complexion products go clean & inclusive,"With its very light, aqueous formula, the BelleRadiance cucumber water-based foundation by Be + Radiance leaves a thin, even, matte veil on the skin. The texture is perfectly in line with the yoga skin trend, which promotes discreet, but efficient textures for a flawless complexion without any makeup effect. The brand adopted a clean makeup approach consisting in banning all the ingredients suspected of disturbing the skin balance (silicones, mineral oils, perfumes, phenoxyethanol, nanoparticles…). To Aïmara Coupet, the brand founder, makeup is lagging behind in terms of clean beauty, compared to skincare or hair care. “Consumers want to choose their beauty products in line with their lifestyles. They do sport to keep fit and pay attention to what they eat and what their skincare creams and shampoos contain, so there is no reason why they should not do the same with makeup. This idea of a 360° lifestyle coherence is a booming trend.” The brand already offers a range of foundation shades designed to meet the needs of all complexions. “The core of inclusivity does not consist in taking part in a race for shades and references, but in including everyone from the very beginning, on a fair basis. The rainbow of the BelleRadiance foundation is composed of 15 shades equally representing the wide variety of skin tones,” she explains. Already available in France in a dozen Monoprix stores, in pharmacies, and on beradiancebeauty.com, the brand aims to expand in the US and Canada, as well as in Asia. The first step for it involves showcasing products to North-American buyers at the Cosmoprof North America show on July 28-30, 2019, in Las Vegas. “Our cucumber water-based foundation was selected for the final of the Cosmoprof North America Awards in the makeup category,” rejoices Aïmara Coupet. Next fall, Be + Radiance will launch a silicone-free primer, followed by highlighters, blushes, and powders - of course, all of them will preserve the skin’s microbiological balance. Already supported by ex-SIMP Alain Blondel’s Montaigu Développement funds, the brand has launched a new fundraising campaign with an objective of 500,000 euros to finalize a comprehensive range and start developing on the global level, both physically and digitally, as part of a reasonable business plan which forecasts a 10-million-euro turnover in five years."
KDC/One continues to expand into Europe with the acquisition of Swallowfield in the UK,"Knowlton Development Corporation (KDC/One) continues its external growth strategy.  Already the #1 subcontractor for the cosmetics industry in North America, the company, headquartered in Longueil, Quebec, continues to expand its manufacturing capabilities in Europe with the acquisition of the manufacturing business of the UK-based Swallowfield Group. The GBP 35 million transaction does include Swallowfield’s owned brands division, which will now be based in Teddington and is expected to change its name to Brand Architekts Group. ""Following KDC/One’s successful acquisition of Paris-based Alkos Group earlier this month, we are confident that Swallowfield’s operations will further enhance our strategic presence in the region and solidify our leadership in beauty, health and personal care around the world,"" explained Nicholas Whitley, President and CEO of KDC/One. With more than 140 years of experience, Swallowfield is an established leader in the personal care and beauty space. Swallowfield’s Manufacturing business focuses on the development, formulation, and supply of products for customers which include many of the world’s leading brands. Having built out key specialist product areas, Swallowfield’s differentiated manufacturing offering includes aerosols, hot pour products, cosmetic pencils, fragrance and gifting. Headquartered in Wellington, UK, the Manufacturing business has approximately 560 employees and operates across three main facilities in Europe (two in the United Kingdom, in Wellington and Bideford, and one in Czech Republic, in Tabor), as well as a sourcing office in China and sales offices in Paris and New York. ""The Company’s international capabilities make it a natural complement to KDC/One, and its strong reputation for quality, service and innovation matches KDC/One’s own dedication to high-touch innovation, operational excellence and speed to market. We believe that by joining a larger, focused entity, our Manufacturing business will move forward with a clearer vision for the future while protecting the value of the business,"" said Brendan Hynes, Chairman of Swallowfield. The transaction, which is expected to close in August of 2019, is subject to the approval of shareholders of Swallowfield. Upon transaction closing, the entire manufacturing business and associated assets will be wholly owned by KDC/One and operate as KDC/One Swallowfield. Furthermore, Swallowfield’s Matthew Gazzard will be appointed as KDC/One Swallowfield President and Jane Fletcher to be KDC/One Swallowfield Sales & Marketing Director. Tim Perman will remain Chief Executive Officer of Swallowfield’s brand business to be renamed Brand Architekts Group."
The Bogart Group finds balance in retail,"Premium Beauty News - How does a group of perfume and cosmetics brands, like Bogart, ends up doing retail? Nicolas Dewitte - The whole group’s strategy results from its history. The Bogart Group was founded in 1975 and quickly developed on the global stage. Year after year, the company grew by acquiring perfume brands, like Ted Lapidus and Balenciaga – we sold the latter to Kering 20 years later. Today, The Bogart Group counts four perfume brands (Jacques Bogart, Ted Lapidus, Carven, and Chevignon), two skincare brands (Méthode Jeanne Piaubert and Stendhal), and April, the multi-segment brand specialized in skincare, makeup, and bath products. We gradually developed the R&D part, and then purchased more and more perfume and cosmetics/makeup plants in France. We have adopted a very integrated model, with our plants, laboratories, and R&D, so it was only natural to add retail. We aim to become a significant player in selective beauty. Premium Beauty News - How is this distribution activity doing today? Nicolas Dewitte - Fifteen years ago, The Bogart Group purchased 20 April stores in Israel, so we tested this manufacturer/retailer model at that period. Now, we have 42 April stores there, 32 stores in France, 87 points of sale in Germany, with the HC network, and since November 2018, we have reached 200 points of sale in Belgium, through the Planet Parfums and Di networks, which are very well-established in this country, in addition to six new perfume stores in Flanders, since May. Then, we have also just partnered for three years with the Printemps department store, starting with Metz, France. It is materialized by an April perfume corner offering the main selective brands on the market, including the group’s brands, so we benefit from a significant traffic to reach a broader range of customers. Premium Beauty News - Are you considering making it the main activity of the group? Nicolas Dewitte - Our positioning is that of a perfume and cosmetics manufacturer-retailer, but it is true that for the first time this year, with 370 perfume stores, our turnover in stores will have exceeded that of the “brand” activity. Overall, our turnover will reach about 300 million euros for the year 2019. We have managed to develop a model which works well in terms of profitability. It is an outstanding tool for us to develop the best products and brands, and best meet consumer expectations. Premium Beauty News - It is a bold challenge within the current context in selective distribution. How can we explain these particular dynamics? Nicolas Dewitte - We highlight the broadest offering possible, with our products, of course, but also with other groups’ brands. But what characterizes us most is that we are both a manufacturer and retailer, with the corresponding reactions that feed both activities. On the one hand, we listen to our customers’ needs to develop an adapted offering. With 370 perfume stores, we listen a lot, and what is incredible is that we receive information directly from five different countries about how trends and consumer needs change, and then we can send it to our marketing teams and laboratories. This system is very fulfilling. On the other hand, the manufacturer’s reflex involves a strong expertise on the part of sales teams in perfume stores, with people who really understand what an olfactory concept is, for example, as well as certified beauty and wellness professionals. We endeavour to share the industrial know-how of our R&D laboratories down to our stores, so that our customers feel this particular listening skill at April perfume stores. We have a special quality in France, which we are not always aware of: we have highly specialized advisors. It is definitely in our interest to develop this French standard. It makes us stronger and more demanding in other countries. The development of partnerships with prestigious brands is a strong area of development for the group (as can be seen with Hermès in Israel, for example). And we pay attention to any other proposal that might help develop our network, in particular in Europe. Premium Beauty News - Is this how you view sales in French stores? Nicolas Dewitte - We believe there must be a very strong bond between manufacturers and retailers. Our growth will depend on smart partnerships with real cosmetics experts working for brands to both have a broad, complete offering and target particular areas. For example, the latest Carven perfume, Dans Ma Bulle, reached the Top 5 in April perfume stores in several countries after a few months, alongside heavyweights, like La Vie Est Belle and J’Adore. It just shows that by showcasing a brand with very qualitative work, even if it is an alternative brand, we can do outstanding things with customers who love discovering a different way to create perfumes. Clearly, by developing a broader offering, we can reach a different range of customers. The main thing is to keep paying attention to customer expectations. Premium Beauty News - How do you think things are going to evolve? Nicolas Dewitte - Retail and e-commerce will merge. Everyone predicted the end of retail when e-commerce boomed, and yet although it is a huge rise, it will not actually replace retail. The real trend is that they will merge. E-commerce functions, like re-targeting, are better and better used in physical stores, and data transmission will also come from points of sale. Everyone thought data would come from the web, through significant traffic, but inside stores, there is already a lot of precious information about consumer needs and behaviour: it will complete a whole system. Retailers like April, who will adapt to these changes to serve their customers, have a role to play. We aim to accelerate our e-commerce growth, so we just relaunched the www.april-beauty.com website a month ago, in France."
Nippon Shikizai relies on innovation to conquer the global makeup market,"While the Japanese company will celebrate next year the 90th anniversary of its foundation in Japan in 1930 and the 20th anniversary of its establishment in France, it has given itself the means to achieve its new ambitions with a sharp increase in its production capabilities in France and Europe. “Today our formulas are used by many very different brands all over the world, from Asia to Europe and including the two American continents,” states Kouji Okumura, the group’s chairman. “Our strength is really to be recognized as the R&D specialist for the manufacture of cosmetic formulas, and this for many years. We have the capacity to understand the needs of brands and propose them the formulas they were looking for.” The company has taken full advantage of the recent revival of the J-Beauty (as made in Japan cosmetics are usually dubbed). ""Japan is once again the main creativity hub in Asia,"" said Leïla Rochet Podvin, CEO and Founder of trend agency Cosmetics Inspiration & Creation. Over the past five years, the group’s turnover has nearly doubled to reach USD 110 million in 2018 (from USD 63 million in 2014). Export sales, the main driver of the company’s growth, have increased by 44% over three years, especially towards China which accounts for 34% of the Nippon Shikizai’s turnover. To meet this demand and maintain its leadership, Nippon Shikizai has accelerated its investments. Thus, more than USD 30 million were earmarked over the 2018/2020 period, mostly to increase the bulk production capacity in the Tsukuba factory, which had already benefited from significant investments between 2014 and 2017, with the construction of a new facility for the packaging of makeup products. It should be noted that this factory was approved by the U.S. authorities for the production of OTC products. The group also recorded strong growth in Europe, where the it has been present in France since 2000, when it acquired Thépenier Pharma & Cosmetics. After an investment of EUR eight million over four years to modernize the production tool and standardize the production techniques dedicated to “pharma” and cosmetic products, the turnover of Thépenier Pharma & Cosmetics jumped from EUR 9 million in 2014 to EUR 20 million in 2018 and profitability was up to expectations. An impressive growth followed in 2017 by the acquisition of a second French company with a staff of 35 employees, Orléans Cosmetics (now Nippon Shikizai France), specializing in the manufacture of make-up powders, hot-poured products and scented derivatives. A company in which the group, in line with its strategy, invested in 2018 and 2019 nearly one million euros, with the commissioning of new lines dedicated to compaction, the filling of loose powders, hot filling, not to mention the creation of a new cleaning room and new blenders. The aim: modernize the entire machine pool and quickly increase the production capacity by 30%! Beyond production capacity, R&D is at the heart of the investments made by Nippon Shikizai. Today, the group employs more than 60 researchers in cosmetic formulation and some 40 engineers dedicated to the design of manufacturing and filling lines and more generally to all industrial processes. The group’s best known formula is the famous Warm Water Washable  mascara, which is resistant to both tears and humidity but can be removed under warm water. Over the last ten years, more than six million units of this formula were produced each year serving the many Asian brands that adopted the solution. Introduced this year on the U.S. market, the formula is already a hit among American consumers. To complete his makeup ranges, which still account for 85% of its sales, the group presented at the Cosmoprof show in Bologna a complete range of products designed to protect the skin against the harmful effects of the blue light generated by the screens (mobiles, computers) that have invaded our daily life. The continuation of the group’s international development strategy should lead to new investments in the United States and Asia. “As you know, cosmetics are not just about trends, they are closely influenced by the cultures and traditions of each country and region. And we must absolutely take these facts into account for our effective and successful development,” concludes Kouji Okumura."
Schwan Cosmetics: “We are much more than pencils makers”,"Premium Beauty News - You are 43 years old but as you take on these new responsibilities, you are not really a ""newcomer"" in the company! Tomas Espinosa - Not really, you are right! I am of Mexican origin and, as such, I have worked for Schwan Cosmetics as Managing Director in my country for ten years. So, I know the company, its products and its assets. As you know, this Mexican base does not only produce make-up pencils that account for 50% of the activity, it is also specialized in cocreation development with mayor brands to bring their unique brand DNA with our expertise which is way more than pencils. Premium Beauty News - Could you, first recall what makes the DNA, strength and therefore the philosophy of Schwan Cosmetics.  Tomas Espinosa - The DNA and the history of our company are punctuated by innovations. More than 90 years ago, we invented the cosmetics pencil and since then we are constantly thinking ahead. What is important for us is that, whether you are a fledging start-up or a well-established brand, , we develop, in close cooperation with you, custom solutions that are perfectly tailored to your target groups. And it’s very important to us that current and future generations can consciously experience beauty. That’s why we create products that combine quality, aesthetics, and responsibility. But what is just as important today is our desire to harvest from our expertise in formula and process and broaden our product offering by developing a real ""eco-system"" with partners, particularly in packaging. That allows us to ensure a real differentiation. Always with the same motto: ""Desire, Performance, Quality, Safety"" Premium Beauty News - Could you give us an overview of your company and its position in the cosmetic market with you some figures? Tomas Espinosa - It is easy! We have the trust of 700 brands in 70 Countries and more than half a billion women annually worldwide.  We continue to develop region, brand, climate and skin specific textures- Eyeliner in China, eyeshadow in South Africa, lip gloss in Brazil…, we have the perfect solution for any demand. People from over 30 nationalities work for us. Together we have one mission: To create sustainable, innovative products that excite consumers all over the world. Worldwide there are about 3,000 dedicated employees working for us. And we have 9 production facilities around the globe to guarantee sustained production and short supply routes. Premium Beauty News - In a few months’ time a new Schwan Cosmetics has emerged? Tomas Espinosa - Yes! We can say that we are adapting ourselves to a world that is changing extremely quickly. Who could have predicted the sudden and impressive emergence of all these new brands? Who could have predicted the overwhelming influence of Social Media and of influencers? And, most of all, so quickly. Still, the pencil remains and will remain an essential feature on the cosmetics market. Schwan Cosmetics allows to design a cosmetic line just the way the customer wants it, down to the finest details. Our 360° customizing-approach that zeros in on a brand’s individuality offers one-of-a-kind products, formulas, and packaging that are tailored to the needs of our customer. But today, that’s no longer enough anymore. This is why, with the collaboration of partners, we also offer new"" product solutions"" that help the brands specific USP and, above all, other packaging solutions. Premium Beauty News - The environment is also a challenge for your industry. How do you address it? Tomas Espinosa - Well yes, it is a challenge but we also see a big opportunity for a new wave of disruptive innovation. We have started this journey some years ago and we now offer a full range of more sustainable products. To bring transparency to our effort, we are part of the Sustainable Packaging Initiative for CosmEtics - SPICE - which is an initiative that brings together organizations in the cosmetics industry to work towards a common goal: to collectively shape the future of sustainable packaging. SPICE develops and publishes business-oriented methodologies and data to support resilient decision-making to improve the environmental performance of the entire packaging value chain. At Schwan Cosmetics, we have been working hard on this issue and will continue to do so in the future."
Pierre Fabre consolidates presence on the Brazilian dermocosmetics market,"The Pierre Fabre group started exploring the dermocosmetics segment in Brazil in 1999, with Eau Thermale d’Avène, their flagship brand. “It is a complex country, but dermocosmetics involve a positive combination of factors,” explains Philippe de Carvalho. “Dermatologists play a significant prescriptive role, so we had to convince them. Then, women consumers are very actively involved, so they expect results, and there is also a large network of 70,000 pharmacies, which represents an important distribution capacity.” In 2006, the group sped things up, by acquiring the Darrow Laboratório brand, a renowned oily skin specialist. This operation helped Pierre Fabre lay its hands on a strong sales network and on an industrial site on the outskirts of Rio. As a complement to the Darrow lines, the group invested to produce a few Avène ranges locally and adapt them to the market’s specific sensorialities, while asserting its leadership in terms of oily skin prescriptions. “The issue of oily skins, or skins perceived as such, is typically Brazilian. Apart from hygiene, here, the beauty routine also includes photoprotection. So, we pool our expertises in these fields to offer a healthcare solution that is also a deeply cosmetic product combining an oily or acne-prone skin treatment and a safe sun protection,” explains Anne-Laure Gaudry. Starting from 2012, the work done by the group’s medical visitors with Brazilian dermatologists gave a further boost to the development and reputation of Pierre Fabre products. The fact that healthcare professionals contribute to raising awareness of the risks of sun exposure oriented the market towards products guaranteeing both quality and safety. Today, sun care represents a third of the country’s dermocosmetics market. With Mat Perfect, a photoprotection product specially designed for Brazil, Eau Thermale Avène offers a dry skin feel (toque seco), a 12h matte effect, and an SPF up to 60. “Another major trend requires offering matching shades. Mat Perfect is available in a white/colourless version, or with concealing pigments,” adds Anne-Laure Gaudry. In Brazil, like all around the world, the formulation of Pierre Fabre sun products complies with the group’s strict guidelines. Mat Perfect is actually based on a unique, minimalist technology involving only four filters, excluding oxybenzone, which do not penetrate the skin barrier for more safety and protection. In Brazil, Pierre Fabre also banks on A-Oxitive, the anti-ageing Avène line enriched in vitamin C. If anti-ageing is not one of the most popular claims in Brazil, vitamin C is widely appreciated by consumers, and the company relies on their interest in efficient radiance-enhancing solutions. “We highlighted one of our global gems, i.e., a cutting edge technology which protects the active and releases it in the dermis, to develop a product that matches local expectations and satisfies the criteria we use all around the world. The advantage of a research centre based in the country itself lies in its local dimension,” emphasizes Anne-Laure Gaudry. The BIC should make it possible to launch ten new products a year, the first being expected for July 2019, regarding the Darrow ranges intended for Brazil, and the Avène ranges designed for the whole Latin American market. On a more global level, Pierre Fabre is also present on the huge Brazilian hair segment, with Ducray, the expert in hair dermatology. And in the field of body care, new launches are under study at Darrow: the Nutriol line of moisturizers will offer consumers a more affordable dermocosmetics option. “Here, we comply with the group’s international quality standards using the same equipment, while acting as a research arm for the world. Brazil is a source of inspiration for Pierre Fabre, in particular for its biodiversity. Our expertise is already a reference on the global level,” explains the Director of the Centre, which already counts twelve employees, including three exclusively dedicated to formulation. Sun protection, oily skins, hair care, body care… Thanks to this new research and development centre, the Pierre Fabre group benefits from a strong tool to consolidate its presence in Brazil."
Canada’s KDC/One acquires France’s Alkos Group,"If you remember: In March 2018, Nicholas Whitley, CEO of the KDC/One Group, had announced in an interview to Premium Beauty News that after acquiring five businesses in three years, he was targeting a twofold increase in sales in the next coming months, adding that the billion dollar target in revenues was in sight and that the next steps for external growth could very well be in Europe and Asia. Meanwhile, in June 2018, the Alkos Group was inaugurating its brand new Inter Cosmétiques factory in Angers, France. An investment of 12 million euros including buildings over a surface area of 17,000 m² on a site of 46,000 m² (three times the surface of the previous site), R&D laboratories (800 m2) and administrative premises (900 m2). This investment enabled Inter Cosmétiques to increase its manufacturing capacity by nearly 40%, and to leverage on a bulk manufacturing workshop boasting the best international standards, while also gaining in competitiveness through a consolidated service offer. A year later, this acquisition by the Canadian Group becomes a reality! For Nicholas Whitley, CEO of KDC/One, ""the Alkos Group is deeply rooted in the cosmetics industry and has an unparalleled reputation for innovation and product quality. Its customer-centric vision will give KDC/One strategic access to the European market and to unique technologies that will strengthen our leading position in high-end beauty products. We look forward to working with the Alkos team and with our partners at Cornell Capital in order to leverage on the entire product portfolio, further diversify our customer base, and seize cross-selling opportunities benefiting all stakeholders involved."" And for Gérard Gieux, founder and owner of the Alkos Group, ""thanks to KDC/One, the Alkos Group will have access to the financial resources it needs to continue making the investments that will help strengthen its strategic position in the market. The Group is excited to enter new markets and continue to offer quality products to its current and future customers alongside a trusted partner who shares its values, in order to grow its business in the long-term."" Over the past six years, the Canadian group KDC/One, headquartered in Longueuil, Quebec, has undergone a significant transformation, mainly through successive acquisitions across all sub-contracting beauty sectors. The Group, which achieved sales of $ 950 million, employs some 4,800 people in Canada and the United States. Indeed, the KDC Group (Knowlton Development Corporation) has quite a track record! It all started in 2002 with the creation of the Emballages Knowlton Company, with a staff of 300 people and sales of $ 80 million. In 2003, the Novacap Investment Fund took control of the Company. The first acquisitions took place in 2007 with Tri Tech Laboratories and Body Blue Inc. But it is really in 2014 that things started gaining momentum with the launch of the Novacap Industries IV Fund, which gave the Group the means for its expansion. In January 2015, KDC acquired ChemAid Laboratories Company, a formulator and manufacturer of skincare, hair care and bath and body care products located in Saddle Brook, New Jersey. On October 14 and 21 of the same year, KDC acquired the Kolmar Laboratories and Acupac Packaging Companies to the Kolmar Labs, a New York formulator and manufacturer of make-up and skincare products, as well as Cosmetic Technologies, a Californian cosmetics contract manufacturer; an acquisition which allowed the Canadian Group to gain a foothold on the West Coast. The external growth momentum continued with the takeover, on November 16, 2016, of the Thibiant International Company, based in Chatsworth, California, a formulator and manufacturer of personal care and skincare products. On November 9, 2017, KDC took over Aromair Fine Fragrance, a full-service Company specialised in home fragrances, based in New Albany, Ohio. One month later, on December 12, KDC officials announced the acquisition of Northern Labs, a contract manufacturer, located in Wisconsin, specialising in liquid, gel, lotion, and paste products dedicated to personal and home care markets. And to further state the message according to which KDC/One is committed to be the leader and a showcase when it comes to innovations, the network of companies launched a state-of-the-art Innovation Lab in the summer of 2018 in Saddle Brook, New Jersey. In November 2018, KDC/One joined forces with Cornell Capital, a private equity firm with offices in New York and Hong Kong, to expand its international growth, invest in high-end product innovation and strengthen its production resources. Cornell Capital LLC is a U.S. private investment firm with $3 billion of capital under management. With offices in New York and Hong Kong. ""Partnering with strong and entrepreneurial management teams,"" detailed the release, ""the company takes a value-oriented approach for investing in the financial, industrial and consumer sectors."" Henry Cornell, the former Vice Chairman of Goldman Sachs’ Merchant Banking Division, founded Cornell Capital in 2013. With the Alkos Group, KDC/One now operates thirteen production units in North America and France and employs more than 5,200 people for sales totalling more than $ 1 billion. In 1996, Gérard Gieux set foot in the formulation and manufacture of cosmetics products with the acquisition of Alkos Cosmétiques, a French manufacturer of make-up pencils, previously named Conté Cosmétiques, owned by the BIC Group. In 2008, Gérard Gieux founded the Alkos Group following the acquisition of two other French companies, Inter Cosmétiques (make-up and skincare products) and Sagal Cosmétiques (scented soaps and deo sticks). In 2014, to support an ambitious investment programme, he called on the MBO Partenaires Investment Fund, which had become the majority shareholder (51%) of the Holding Company (AAXEN). The latter included the Alkos Group and Cosmogen, a company specialised in packaging solutions and applicators, also created by Gérard Gieux in 1982. After a rapid growth of all these entities, in March 2017, the sale of Cosmogen (fully taken over by MBO Partenaires) allowed the Alkos Group to repay all of its senior debt and to consider continuing its investment programme by taking advantage of the construction of the new Inter Cosmétiques plant in Angers and of the development of innovative products. 2011 was a turning point for the French Group. Because, at the time, under the leadership of its new management team, both the image of a now full-fledged Group will be strengthened, and the products and services offer also considerably expanded. French and proud to be! ""It is not by chance if we wanted to assert our feeling of belonging to the long-standing expertise for the manufacture of French cosmetics, with our small Eiffel Tower at the centre of our communication,"" explained that year, Florence Lefeuvre, Group Sales VP, Marketing & Communication, in an interview to Premium Beauty News. Especially since this expertise of the Alkos Group is quite actual. First line of development at the time: reinforce the image of the Group in its own right, which concentrated on the one hand, the know-how of Alkos, the only manufacturer of made-in-France make-up pencils praised by export markets, and on the other of Inter Cosmétiques, specialized in the formulation and manufacture of cosmetics and skincare products and finally of Sagal Cosmétiques, a manufacturer of scented soaps and deo sticks. Second line: highlight the capacity for innovation and the full extent of the offer of these three entities: Make-up in all its texture forms, personal care products, scented soaps and deos. Third line: invest at the industrial level to sustain growth. A comprehensive and attractive offer combined with a ""product repositioning"" and industrial investments that will have borne fruit eight years later."
Arcancil goes green with a range codeveloped with Monoprix,"By jumping on the green bandwagon with a new vegan and committed range with a strong natural overtone, the French brand is back on the shelves of the French downtown retailer. “The green movement is nothing new to Arcancil: we have already launched natural, clean and vegan references as part of our ranges, but this new opportunity with Monoprix was a way for us to create a new, much coherent specific line,” explains CEO Anne Delleur Cabarrus. The formulas developed for Lab Végétal are free from any ingredient of animal origin. For example, in mascaras, beeswax was replaced by vegetable waxes, like carnauba wax. But beyond these simple substitutions, Arcancil endeavoured to remove certain controversial ingredients, without compromising on efficacy and safety. “Our laboratories have designed formulas free from allergens, parabens, phthalates, and silicones D4 and D5, while maintaining the preservation quality of products,” adds Alix Pélegrin, Brand Manager Arcancil Paris. In addition, a natural active highlighted on the packaging was added to every product to enhance performance in terms of comfort and gentleness, like cotton oil, aloe vera, tapioca, or camomile. The challenge was to preserve the brightness and intensity of Arcancil colours in a range of highly innovative formulas. “Lab Végétal is not a nude range. It is an integral part of the Arcancil story, a brand specialized in intense makeup,” emphasizes Anne Delleur Cabarrus. Arcancil Paris also integrated Lab Végétal to an ecoresponsible approach, by using recyclable kraft paper outer packs sourced from sustainable forests (FSC label) and reducing plastic with powder packaging increasingly made of cardboard. Lab Végétal also joined up to the 1% for the Planet association. Every year, Arcancil Paris will donate 1% of the Lab Végétal turnover to associations committed to environmental protection. So far, the range counts about fifty references. It will be available in about twenty Monoprix stores in Paris and across France starting from June 2019, but also on Amazon and on the Arcancil website. It will replace the selection of vegan products introduced by the brand last February, and new references are expected after summer and by the end of the year. By going green, Arcancil aims to recruit younger consumers. “Monoprix attracts downtown customers in search of green cosmetics. Young customers are increasingly turning to natural products, and we know that is how they will enter makeup,” concludes Anne Delleur. Apart from France, over the next few weeks, Arcancil will offer Lab Végétal in Monoprix stores in Luxembourg and test it on markets with a high demand for natural products: Europe, Canada, Australia, Tunisia, Morocco, and the French West Indies, among others."
"ELSI revisits Clean Beauty with a personalized, microbiome-friendly solution ","The ELSI startup aims to shake up the American Clean Beauty model – they recently won the French-American Entrepreneurship Award. “In the US, there is no dermocosmetics culture, like in France. So, we aim to help most consumers with a sensitive skin, because they feel a bit confused,” explains Elsa Jungman, the brand founder. Launched last May, the moisturizing serum composed of three ingredients meets the demand of a community the brand identified over a year on Instagram, and which already counts 10,000 followers. The product is available online and has already been ordered in over 40 States. In return, the young entrepreneur collects consumers’ data to get as close as possible to their expectations and set up the second part of the project. Following the model developed by Stitch Fix, a dynamic American startup which, every month, offers a range of clothing adapted to their subscribers’ tastes in a box, based on a questionnaire, ELSI aims to collect data based on their users’ feedback in order to offer skincare products adapted to sensitive skins and optimized depending on the issues, lifestyles, and seasons. As a complement, the company aims to conduct investigations on the skin microbiome of its “love community” of volunteers across the country. The startup has launched a fundraising campaign for its non-standard cosmetics model to develop over the next few months."
L’Oréal strives for transparency with ’Inside Our Products’ platform,"""Consumers are changing their way of buying consumer products, and are asking brands to provide more transparent and clearer information on the composition of products,"" said the L’Oréal group in a statement. Each year, the brands belonging to the L’Oréal group - L’Oréal Paris, Kiehl’s, Maybelline New York, Yves Saint Laurent Beauté, Lancôme and Biotherm, just to name a few - offer consumers a multitude of products, from makeup and face and body care to fragrance and sunscreen. L’Oréal has now launched a platform giving customers access to information about what’s in the firm’s cosmetics, the ingredients it uses, and the group’s commitments to safety. ""Through this site, we are committed to transparently providing clear and honest information to our consumers, based both on our in-depth knowledge of cosmetic ingredients inherited from more than 100 years of research and on recognized scientific realities,"" says Hervé Navellou, General Manager of L’Oréal in France. The platform sheds light on to the way in which products are formulated and manufactured.  Among the ingredients in the spotlight, L’Oréal focuses in particular on parabens, palm oil, sun filters, permanent oxidative hair dyes, silicones and mineral oils. Each ingredient is accompanied by a detailed information page explaining its origin, its various uses, and, if necessary, the reasons why it may be questioned. Plus, the pages let users know how such ingredients are listed on product packaging for easy identification. L’Oréal also provides a contact form for web users’ questions on the subject. The platform, which is due to evolve over time, is available in French and English. Many cosmetic brands are now questioning the best way to meet the new expectations of consumers. The launch of natural ranges, including certified organic products, was a first response, along with the launch of environment-friendly packaging. For instance, in 2018 L’Oréal launched Seed Phytonutrients in the USA, “the most organic brand” ever launched within the group. In the same vein, French luxury beauty house Guerlain (LVMH Group) has launched Bee Respect, a transparency and traceability platform for all its skincare products. Among others, the Bee Respect traceability tool provides consumers with the product composition, the sourcing and function of the ingredients, and the origin of the packaging materials: a first for the luxury cosmetics industry. There is every reason to believe that the trend towards more transparency will continue."
2009-2019: The Weckerle Group is celebrating at Eislingen ten years of growth of its Full-Service activity,"The plant was successfully integrated in the Group with its full expertise benefiting to all of its customers around the world. ""We use our own technologies to develop innovative product lines and our customers are very satisfied,"" had explained at the time Thomas Weckerle, CEO, ""And then Full-Service, at the start, a ""heavy trend"", became an essential and sustainable activity"", he added. The entire team at the Eislingen factory (250 people) can be proud of the gone through road. The growth of the Group’s Full-Service activity has been particularly robust over the last five years, growing by more than 40%. First ""product"" category across all segments, the production of lipsticks followed by mascaras, foundations and skin care products. ""In the past years, we have repositioned both our products and our development strategies,"" explained Randolf Lehmann-Tolkmitt. ""It was also about rebalancing our customer portfolio by making the right choices."" Decisions that have paid off. Especially since, at the same time, the Group increased its R&D capabilities (15 people today), in packaging materials and storage areas that can now store 5,500 pallets. This is also the first plant to have integrated, last July, the new multistick filling machine “MS3” developed by Weckerle Machines. A series of investments that concerned almost all of the Group’s filling activities, including more recently, the filling of jars. The ""powder"" activity is not left out either. ""Our goal is also to increase our foothold in this product range as well as in skincare,"" detailed Bernhard Starzer. Among the other strengths of the Eislingen unit: its expertise and notoriety in the manufacture and packaging of natural products and toothpastes. “We focus on natural cosmetics because - for us - it is not a trend but a philosophy,” emphasizes Randolf Lehmann-Tolkmitt. Taking advantage from their long-time know-how Weckerle Cosmetics is able to create client specific products that are certified. Talking about certifications: the site meets a very high standard. They hold for example the certificates of IFS and Ecovadis gold status. The commitment for sustainability results even in the fact that Weckerle Cosmetics is certified a climate neutral company."
Kao to debut Sensai in Japan as a first step to broader Asian launch,"Initially a local brand focus on Europe, Sensai is growing as a key asset of Kao’s global portfolio of cosmetic brands. The Japanese group prepares to introduce the brand into the Japanese market in September 2019 before a Sensai debut in China in 2020 followed by an expansion of the brand throughout Asia. Launched in 1983, Sensai products are now sold in some 4,000 department stores and perfumeries in more than forty countries, mainly in Europe and the Middle East. All the products in the range are manufactured in Japan and are deeply rooted in the Japanese culture with Koishimaru silk as a key ingredient and skin care and make-up rituals inspired from the etiquette of the Japanese tea ceremony. Sensai will debut in Japan with 75 items already marketed globally. The core of the Sensai range in Japan will be the anti-aging care “AS Series” comprised of three products: beauty lotion, emulsion, and cream. However, Sensai’s Japan debut will focus on the travel retail channel for overseas customers. Only a limited number of prestigious department stores as well as an official Sensai online shop will carry the brand domestically, announced Kao. “Points of sale such as exclusive duty-free counters in Japan and other major hubs in Asia will strengthen Sensai in travel retail. Customers in China will also have the opportunity to purchase products before the launch in China through a cross-border e-commerce site from this autumn,” states the group in a release. This decision follows the global reorganization of the group’s brand portfolio announced by Kao in May 2018."
"“Clean Beauty is much more than natural or synthetic ingredients,” Pierre Miasnik, Fiabila","Premium Beauty News - The nail varnish market has not escaped the natural trend, has it? Pierre Miasnik - Today, the green movement is much more than a trend. It is a structural, irreversible, universal shift that can be observed in all cosmetics categories. The younger the consumers, the more concerned they are with these issues. We have already invested a lot in research and development in this field: this year, Fiabila even offers 100% natural nail varnish – a real technical feat! Still, natural resins are not as effective as synthetic ones, which is why we have developed nail varnish that meets all consumer requirements in terms of colour, gloss effect, coverage, drying time, long wear, and application, and which contains 77% natural ingredients, no controversial substance, and a biosourced plasticizer patented in 2010. Again, it was a huge technological challenge! Premium Beauty News - Would it be wiser to talk about a “clean product”, then? Pierre Miasnik - We need to be realistic in our approach. We aim to guarantee the safety of products, while minimizing their environmental impact. Naturalness at all costs is not the answer, so indeed, it would be best to aim at “clean products”. Brands increasingly share this view, and it is actually gaining ground among consumers too, as can be seen with the rise of clean beauty in the US, and with the success of concepts like The Detox Market, or Credo Beauty. A synthetic product is not necessarily “dirty”, just like a natural product is not necessarily “clean”. Many synthetic compounds are absolutely safe for consumers and the environment, while not all natural raw materials are produced in a sustainable way – some are even harmful for health. We should not reject all synthetic products on principle, and neither should we be overoptimistic as regards natural products. That is what is interesting about the notion of clean beauty, and that is also what Credo Beauty express when they tell their customers that “synthetic ingredients can be safe and sustainable, and natural ingredients can be harmful and non-sustainable”. The most important thing is to use “clean” raw materials which are harmless in all respects, but also a “clean” production tool. This aspect is often overlooked, and it is also the most complex to implement, given the associated costs. But our credibility is at stake here. Premium Beauty News - What have you implemented? Pierre Miasnik - As soon as 2001, we removed risky materials from our formulas, like formaldehyde, phthalates, toluene, etc., in order to work exclusively with “clean” raw materials with high purity levels. Our production sites are now free from any traces of toluene or formaldehyde. In addition, we invested a lot to prevent any cross-contamination or pollution in our raw materials. In 2015, we started to build secure, automated production units specially designed for nail varnish in France, the US, and Brazil. It helps us guarantee the purity level of the materials and products we deliver our customers. In practice, we rent six trailers on an annual basis, each one being dedicated to the transport of one raw material (resins, solvents, plasticizers…), and each raw material has its own storage and pumping system, as well as its own pipe system, including production reactors. We are the only nail varnish manufacturer to have fully “clean” plants exclusively focused on nail varnish, which means we are a good way ahead of our competitors. Lastly, we keep investing in R&D, and we have been making much progress with natural pigments, which do not cover the whole colour palette yet. Besides, we are doubling the surface of our laboratories on the French site of Maintenon. Premium Beauty News - Precisely, as far as innovation is concerned, what has Fiabila developed lately? Pierre Miasnik - Last March, we launched the Salon Prodigy innovation, an alternative to permanent gels without the drawbacks. This development was the next step after the Sun Prodigy nail varnish range. Its patented solution is based on the invention of an innovative oligomer which polymerizes under daylight to offer physical hardening properties and the flexibility of standard varnish, while providing a long-lasting result and a gloss effect beyond seven days. Brands still need to better convey this message to consumers, although these products have penetrated the market quite successfully, lately. On the other hand, we used one of our real patents on nitrosamines to produce an exclusive formula with extremely low original nitrosamine levels, in which we added an efficient patented inhibitor. In addition, we have noticed a rising demand for nail care products, so we have developed a full range specially designed for nail health. There is a real efficacy challenge to meet with these products. The future is clearly focused on more natural, sustainable, renewable solutions. Nine years ago, already, we registered a patent on a natural plasticizer. And this year, we created the first 100% natural nail varnish. Our research strategy is definitely oriented towards ever-greener, safer, more sustainable and responsible solutions, but without being dogmatic. If there is no safe, sustainable natural alternative to a “clean” synthetic substance, then we keep the synthetic one until we find a better solution. As a matter of fact, although there are still improvements to be made, applications like Yuka and Clean Beauty will play a major educating role in fighting against greenwashing."
France dominates the global beauty market but needs to adapt,"Two recent studies commissioned by the French Federation of Beauty Companies (FEBEA) highligh the global influence of the French cosmetics industry. On the occasion of its general assembly, the FEBEA unveiled a macro-economic study carried out by Asterès, an economic research and consultancy firm on the French cosmetics industry. This study was completed by an analysis by consulting firm CH2 Conseil which highlights the global reach of the French industry and its main assets while alerting on the risks it is facing. With net sales of the entire industry reaching 45 billion euros in 2017, including 2.9 billion achieved by raw material suppliers, 24 billion by finished product manufacturers and 5 billion by retailers, completed by 14 billion for exports, France dominates the global cosmetics market with a 23% share. Moreover, this domination has not been eroded but was strengthened in recent years as French exports grew by 5% a year over the period 2010-2018, while the world market grew by 4% per year on average over the same period. Namely, the outperformance of the French cosmetics industry is based on significant investments in innovation. Each year, the French cosmetics industry spends about 2% of the sector’s turnover in R&D. Major groups are strong innovation propellers with R&D spending comprised between 3% and 3.5% of their turnover. Beyond this directly quantifiable aspect, the dominant position of the French cosmetics industry is also based on less tangible elements, in particular an emotional and cultural heritage combining tourism, culture, art de vivre and products of excellence. As a result, according to CH2 Conseil, the strength of the French cosmetics takes form through:
– Strong brands benefitting from an undeniable historical heritage,
– Emerging brands that can use ""French attractiveness"" as a signature even from their very beginning,
– Companies of all sizes offering safe and innovative products,
– A recognized and constantly renewed quality, which is illustrated today by the international expansion of the dermo-cosmetic category. However, like many other industrial sectors, cosmetics companies must deal with several destabilizing factors such as the relocation of the economy (for economic or ecological reasons), the need to give meaning to consumption, new concerns for the environment. Beyond these general changes, the French cosmetics industry must also adapt to more specific developments: the rise of brands from countries with a strong cosmetic tradition (Japan, South Korea, etc.), the rise of an Italian industry taking inspiration from French recipes, and the rise of Chinese competitors strongly backed by their national authorities, or the rise of of ""indie brands” targeting young people. To deal with these new challenges, the FEBEA believes that the industry must be better supported by the French authorities, especially on international markets."
"“We aim to put artificial intelligence at the service of perfumers’ creativity,” Calice Becker, Givaudan","Premium Beauty News - Which principles is Carto based on? Calice Becker - In perfumery, we do not really have direct access to all our ingredients, because everything is based on the perfumer’s memory. His memory of ingredients, of what they smell, of their accords… The problem is, memory works by getting rid of unused information to better focus on what’s new, which is why we forget about things. Fortunately! But since we forget about certain things, maybe we miss interesting parts. So, we had to find an answer to this frustration. We started by classifying odorous substances by family and by physical and chemical function, but also accords, etc. This huge work helped organize information based on physico-chemical, hedonic data, or descriptors, for every ingredient multi-labelled and studied by Givaudan for 30 years. Premium Beauty News - But, since it includes the notion of artificial intelligence, does Carto not go beyond this? Calice Becker - It does. This tool should be considered as a highly intuitive, easy-to-use tablet in which we recorded all the information and functionalities that will meet most of perfumers’ needs. Carto invites them to dare create new accords, thanks to a visual, playful approach on a touch screen, while performing instantaneous tests at a speed current sampling methods cannot reach. Noses will actually be able to carry out more tests and assess them to get faster results. They will no longer have to go through repetitive tasks, and their noses and brains will be freed from tedious activities. Premium Beauty News - How can this benefit the perfumery world? Calice Becker - The spectrum of new fragrances will certainly broaden. Over 150 years, we created six olfactory families, which is not much, compared to the number of ingredients. The advent of gourmand perfumes is the latest great invention in perfumery, and it was already 20 years ago. Carto can make suggestions. Combining science and technology will help those that long for new olfactory forms blossom in this creation process. The perfumer will be freed from any constraints; he will be able to focus on his creations."
IL Cosmetics: A successful diversification!,"Premium Beauty News - So obviously it was not a cyclical downturn. The nail polish market is experiencing a real structural crisis? Jean-François Harpes - When the global markets for nail polish experience drops of 50% to 60% and with no real hope of significant recovery, we can indeed refer to it as a structural crisis. When you think about it, this is what happened to lipstick manufacturers about ten years ago with the arrival of lip-gloss. Premium Beauty News - This must have been quite a challenge for your company which was almost only specialized in nail polish?  Jean-François Harpes - There is no mystery! The development of new product categories and, above all, the diversification of our portfolio, started 15 years ago, were two key elements that today allow us to maintain our growth momentum, to have our factories running at full capacity, to increase our investments in R&D and to cut down costs in order to remain competitive while ensuring our profitability. This is how we manage to overcome both cyclical and current structural market fluctuations. Premium Beauty News - But all this would not have been possible if you had not made the right choices? Jean-François Harpes - To achieve this, you must start by decrypting purchasing behaviors, which is not in the DNA of a sub-contractor. In a customer-driven approach, it is important to communicate with the end consumer as well. This analytical approach that combines panels, digital interactions and organoleptic analyzes allows us to get a global picture of polishes but also of the entire ""nail"" category, which includes nail polishes, semi-permanent formulas, water-based formulas, natural formulas, hybrid formulas and nail care. This approach allows us to allocate our resources to the most productive production units. But, of course, innovation is obviously essential. In 2018, we filed no less than 15 patents for products directly related to consumer needs like, for example, next generation patented bio-sourced formulas free of traditional solvents and of scents which could be perceived as not user friendly, but also of water based formulas with optimized performances and of hybrid formulas developed thanks to the expertise in crosslinking of our ""Gel Lacquers"" production unit to offer holding power and shine, without forgetting of course, to continue the research work started some years ago on alternatives to nitrocellulose... Premium Beauty News - You really played your card well by diversifying yourself in time? Jean-François Harpes - Indeed, and this strategy is paying off today! For example, we expect a 25% increase this year for our Luxcos makeup entity, which allows us to broaden our offer to customers who see IL Cosmetics as a Group able to provide them with comprehensive solutions addressing their needs. Note that, given our already very strong position on mascaras, we have been strengthening in recent months our product lines for the eyes and lips, complementing them with new references. For eye products, where we are already leaders in waterproof formulas, the aim is to offer a solution for each of the consumer profiles we identified, such as the development of high-performance Vegan formulas (both cream and waterproof), but also of products suiting sport addicts with perspiration resistant formulas, whatever the circumstances, and of easy to remove formulas for active women. For the latter we will showcase, at the upcoming MakeUp in Paris trade show, a new makeup removal technique developed and directly inspired from consumer needs. And of course, don’t forget that all our products will soon be supported and validated by consumer panels. Premium Beauty News - This diversification necessarily involved industrial investments? Jean-François Harpes  - Absolutely! [Industrially speaking, we have modernized and expanded our production plant specialized in bulk makeup in Luxembourg by doubling its production capacity, while packaging operations for makeup products will start this summer in our unit located in Bulgaria (capacity of 100 million units). In total we have tripled our full-service packaging capacity. Premium Beauty News - Your presence abroad, particularly in China, is indeed an ideal line of vision? Jean-François Harpes - That’s right! Asian markets are often considered today as those who are influencing Western beauty. China for example, is the country with the biggest concentration of ""Millennials"", a consumer base, which is a key target today for all cosmetic payers. Being a leader in this market, allows us to anticipate future consumer needs on the European continent. Simply take the example of water-based polishes that already represent 20% to 30% of the Chinese market and which are slowly but surely gaining in importance in France."

From East to West: Takasago reasserts inspiration with new visual identity,"“To start with, we had to understand Takasago’s DNA, just like for any brand”, explains Nathalie Helloin-Kamel, Head of Global Fine Fragrance of Takasago. As the only Japanese perfume creation house, Takasago makes a real difference on the perfume market. Their fine fragrance creation centre was established in 1978, in Paris, by two renowned perfumers: Pierre Bourdon and Michel Almairac. Their era was marked by blockbusters, like Cool Water, Jil Sander Sun, Jazz by Saint-Laurent, and Tsar by Van Cleef. Today, the house owns two other centres, in NYC and São Paulo. “Great perfumes emerge from inspirational encounters, but also from deep beliefs. In fact, at some point, we need to understand each other and speak the same language,” adds Nathalie Helloin-Kamel. That is why perfume creation is a human adventure, above all. This belief was the common thread that helped build up a new visual identity and signature and infuse perfume with poetry again. “I wanted to unveil and highlight the fact that the act of perfume creation mainly depends on what the perfumer has on his mind. That is where beauty and magic lie,” she explains. To create the visual, the Marystone agency contacted artist and Artistic Director Valérie Lade. She started with a collage, an artistic piece of work made with elements that had nothing to do with each other. “To me, this artistic form corresponded to Takasago’s world,” she reveals. There is only one step from a dreamlike, fantasy, almost surreal form to a journey into the imaginary world. “First, I chose a modern Japanese woman with lips adorned with red. But then, I deliberately made her nose disappear! The presence of clouds evokes the air, but above all, a journey into the imaginary world, with flowers of different colours. It is a way to highlight the fact that the perfumer’s creativity depends on what he has on his mind,” explains Valérie Lade. In other words, this creation combines the Eastern and Western cultures: Takasago’s philosophy and vision for almost 100 years – an invitation to travel and immerse oneself in the creator’s sensorial world, from which the company draws its inspiration, dreams, and ingredients, to better imagine tomorrow’s perfumes. It is a real nod to the first journey of Tadaka Kainosho, founder of Takasago, from Kyoto to Grasse, in 1910. A chemist by training, Tadaka Kainosho founded his company based on a strong R&D culture (Nobel Prize 2001, Ryoji Noyori, with chiral chemistry, green chemistry…). Created in 1920 in Kyoto, the company owes its name to a Japanese Noh drama tale about a couple who lived in peace and harmony under the twin pine tree of the town of Takasago. It may not really be a coincidence if pine is one of the iconic ingredients of the company’s R&D! With this new signature, “Takasago. Maison de Parfumeurs. From Kyoto to Grasse. Since 1920”, the company intends to unite its story, that of its founder, of its origins, and of its inspirations. There is also a desire for refinement, delicacy, and beauty. In a word, “our raison d’être is to sell difference”, concludes Nathalie Helloin-Kamel."
Natura buys Avon and becomes the world’s 4th largest cosmetics group,"The merger creates a group with leading positions in relationship selling through Avon´s and Natura’s over 6.3 million Consultants and Representatives, a global footprint through 3,200 stores, as well as an expanded digital presence across all companies. The combined Group is expected to have annual gross revenues of over US$10 billion, over 40,000 associates and be present in 100 countries. With this acquisition, Natura &Co becomes the world’s fourth-largest beauty group. Natura &Co’s portfolio includes the brands Natura, The Body Shop and Aesop.  The addition of Avon should enhance the group’s ability to better serve its different consumer profiles and distribution channels and expand into new geographies. The company expects the combination to result in synergies estimated at US$150 million to US$250 million annually, “some of which will be reinvested to further enhance capabilities in digital and social selling, research & development and brand initiatives and to continue to grow the Group’s geographic footprint.” ""Direct selling was a social network before the word even existed, and the arrival of technology and globalization only multiplied opportunities to connect with consumers in a meaningful way. The peer-to-peer sales model is evolving towards social selling,” said Luiz Seabra, Co-Founder of Natura. The transition from the traditional model of relationship selling to a more digital scheme should indeed be the key to the success of the operation. As part of this transaction, a new Brazilian holding company, Natura Holding S.A., has been created. Natura &Co’s shareholders will own approximately 76% of the combined company, while Avon shareholders will own approximately 24%."
Beauty startups and the challenge of growth,"On the hyper-competitive beauty market, the key to last lies in the validity of the product or service offered. This obvious fact is subject to the filter of an increasingly well-informed, hyper-connected population. “The first selection occurs quite early. The product reality vs the brand promise is essential. You cannot fool consumers for long in this world exacerbated by influencers and social media,” observes Maxime Garcia-Janin, creator of Sillages Paris, the first fully online, customizable Haute Parfumerie brand. The relevance of the product to its potential target also depends on the choice of an adapted distribution channel. “Entrepreneurs often focus on making their products perfect, whereas first, they need to find their distribution channel to make the best-adapted offer,” explains Laure Bouguen, founder of the Ho Karan brand, a natural, vegan, made in France range with a flagship ingredient: cannabis. “Initially, we had planned to be distributed in pharmacies and through organic networks, but it is actually when we found our own place in the selective world that we were able to develop, although we had to adapt the product to match this channel’s criteria,” she adds. After a first version intended for men launched in 2016, the brand was revamped to become mixed and offer new formulas and packaging. Once it is on the right track, the young brand can be faced with the other side of success. So, to avoid disappointing its new customers, it should be able to meet their expectations through a better-structured development strategy. “The limiting factor for all young brands is the company cash. It is tricky to anticipate stock management and advance production fees,” explains Marie Drago, creator of Gallinée, a range of skin microbiome-balancing skincare products which has enjoyed a three-digit growth for three years – since it was founded. “Distributors pay brands quite late after they have been delivered the products, although these have already been paid for to manufacturers. All this creates a real need in terms of working capital,” she adds. Then, in addition to these production and cash management constraints, there are new logistics, marketing and communication needs, so you need to find new recruits for your team. As a result, Marie Drago chose a minority shareholder for its capital: Unilever Venture. “It is true I had to divest a minimal part of my shares, but I get much more than with a financing solution. I also get tips, I can reach new distributors, and I benefit from the support of experts,” says the entrepreneur. Soon after it was created, Sillages Paris also started raising funds. “The brand was launched in November 2017, and in November 2018, L’Oréal bought into our capital with a minority investment, which helped us keep our independence. It was the first time the group had invested in a startup, which they thought was in line with perfumery’s evolution towards digital technologies. It is not only about financial resources, because we have access to mentors who help us with logistics, regulations, retail, online presence optimization… It is a real win-win partnership,” claims Maxime Garcia-Janin. Sillages Paris will open their first wholly-owned store next month. As she is dealing with the success of her application, Marine Chevalier, co-founder of My Beauty Community, is looking for funds to structure her team and develop on the global level. Intended to guide users towards the best choice of cosmetic products, based on feedback shared by a tailor-made community, the app will soon celebrate its third anniversary – and it already counts 50,000 subscribers. “We are still the first players on the market to give the floor to consumers this way, which provides us with a widely recognized reference status as regards data, because we get an exceptional quantity of insights. We have been looking for funds to maintain this lead, it is crucial. But the key to our success is based on our independence from brands, so they cannot buy into our capital. It is up to us to find people who understand what we do, while remaining impartial,” she explains. Based on these various approaches, Marine Chevalier highlights the importance of the network of experts or other startups, which is usually built up through incubators directly related to the cosmetics world or not. “It is important to spend time exchanging with other startups. It is not a waste of time, quite the contrary. It is cooperation!” The need for additional funds at a key moment in brands’ development corresponds to an obligation to stay in the race, in this very fast-changing, competitive market. Still, they should keep their progress under control, without indulging in a growth frenzy. “We tend to forget that hypergrowth is as dangerous as undergrowth,” says Maxime Garcia-Janin. This is confirmed by Juliette Munoz, co-founder with her sister of La Canopée, a range of 100% natural, vegan, made in France skincare products. “We started with our own website, which was an immediate success. Today, many e-shops offer La Canopée online, and we are present in 90 points of sale in France and Europe, and Thailand as well, soon. The difficulty lies in trying to go step by step, without rushing, and managing our growth so that we can develop in a healthy way,” says the founder. After three years of research and development, the duo developed its range based on the “homemade” manufacturing concept. This deliberate running strategy provides great flexibility and independence as regards issues like cash management. “We control the whole chain, from sourcing to distribution, so we have no constraints related to manufacturers or money to pay in advance. It helps us keep things under control,” she emphasizes. To her, the challenge this year lies in entering new major export markets. “We need to understand how it works in regulatory terms, in every country, and go discover countries we don’t know…” Validating a driving, differentiating concept, being and remaining close to customers, choosing the right distribution channels, learning to meet the right experts, sharing experiences, finding financial support, while remaining independent, integrating the manufacturing chain, stepping back, staying in line with market trends and one’s basis… here are a few keys to success for brands willing to last!"
Superga Beauty shows off their ambitions in full service with a first product development for HOC,"Resulting from the merger of the respective activities of BPS - a subsidiary of the Superga Group specialising in manufacturing, packing and co-packing with six production sites in Northern France - and Manifesto Factory, which designs and manufactures promotional items dedicated to the luggage, jewellery, textile, perfume and prestige alcohol markets, Superga Beauty made their first appearance last January during the PCD trade show in Paris. Based on a design by Thierry de Baschmakoff, Masha Zanier, a young Parisian of Russian and Georgian heritage hailing from the fashion world, entrusted Superga Beauty to give substance to her project of a new fragrance brand dedicated to highlight the talent of creators of perfumes. A talented master perfumer, one of Firmenich’s main perfumers, and the creator of 200 perfumes, Vincent Schaller was chosen as the very first artist to create HOC first set of perfumes dubbed London City and featuring three fragrances 11:00 AM, 5:00 PM and 9:00 PM inspired from the very specific atmosphere of the British capital. With a vibrantly-coloured adornment on its four outer sides, the bottle features an original engraving that tells the perfume’s story on the top of the magnetic cap. Each fragrance is presented in a magnetised wooden box with a matte varnish finish bearing the brand’s monogram. “Our know-how, which serves the beauty industry, coupled with the Superga Invest Group’s reach in the luxury sector, have allowed us to currently offer niche brands tailormade solutions for their perfume creation, skincare and makeup initiatives,” explains Nathalie Dickeli-Duvoisin, Director of the Superga Beauty Full Service Division. Indeed, Superga Beauty intends to build on the emergence and growing success of Indies Brands, which are looking for suppliers able to support them from the outset of their project, to develop a unique offer based both on Manifesto’s tailor-made design capabilities and BPS’s production and packaging capabilities. In addition, Manifesto Factory has recently expanded its offer with the acquisition of Pictogramme, a French company specializing in the design, manufacture and marketing of high-end advertising objects and gifts. This strategic acquisition will enable the company to provide its customers with “made in France” (or in “made Europe”) premium solutions and to meet the increasing demand for small series. This acquisition is a step further in the strengthening of Superga. Founded in 2001 by Alain Bréau, the group is focusing on services to companies operating in the leading sectors of the French economy: luxury, cosmetics, fashion, and retail. Today, the group has annual turnover of approximately 100 million euros and employs nearly 1,000 employees mainly in France."
Fashion and beauty brands: startups’ founders share experiences on stage,"Premium Beauty News - What is the purpose of the FaB community? Odile Roujol - Most venture capitalists, business angels have a preference for tech-led businesses and ideas. Investors spend more easily into tech products and tend to be sceptical about physical products and the potential return on investment. However, there is a sea of untapped opportunities in the fashion and beauty worlds. We have created this network to help investors and founders of fashion and beauty brands to meet and share experiences together. Premium Beauty News - How do you support them? Odile Roujol - Brands founders can learn from each other at dedicated events and exchange best practices. Product safety and manufacturing is part of having great products and keep customers loyal, we try to make them aware in a context where the regulation doesn’t control all brands. I encourage them to have advisors and mentors to continue to grow as leaders. Some founders have “love money” (money from family, friends and acquaintances) in funding and just raised a seed round, other are at a later stage and even generate revenues above USD 10 million. Premium Beauty News - What is your relationship with investors? Odile Roujol - Investors love the conversation as most entrepreneurs they meet pitch them, here they talk about trends, they don’t have to take a decision at the end of the meeting. They meet people they wouldn’t have time to during their business days. Elsa Jungman, founder of ELSI Beauty Former skin care microbiome expert at AO Biome, Elsa Jungman founded its own brand ELSI Beauty at the beginning of this year and benefited from the very start of the network in San Francisco. “This network has helped me understand the process of creating my own brand. Sometimes you can meet people that are a bit more advanced in the process and you can learn best practices or how to pitch to investors for instance,” states Elsa. Premium Beauty News - How did the FaB community start? Odile Roujol - The movement started with meetings in San Francisco, California, and has expanded in Europe (with London, Paris, Berlin and Spain), and is now expanding into Latin America and Asia (Shanghai, Singapore. Seoul, Tokyo) and for sure in NY and LA. The local chapters are entrepreneurs knowing well the ecosystem. The whole idea is the “pay forward” and “give back” culture dear to the Silicon Valley. We raise a voice together, we support each other, we are stronger as a global movement. We may also bring some industry experts into the mix so they could help founders about formulation, clean beauty, but also about influence, growth... FaB meets every three months in San Francisco, every six months in Paris for example. It’s flexible and connected to the local network and regional needs. The price of tickets just cover the food and beverage and taking pictures. Exciting period as we are a fast-growing community! Built for founders and funders, by entrepreneurs sharing the same passion, the community gathers around 1500 members worldwide."
Guerlain banks on transparency with Bee Respect,"The project was born in 2015, when Sandrine Sommer introduced Robin Cornelius to Laurent Boillot. The Swiss transparency expert made them discover the “Respect Code” concept: this renowned QR Code affixed on product labels recaps the whole product life, from raw materials to end-of-life management. Guerlain’s President was seduced and considered it a potential tool for continuous improvement. But, initially, the Maison only adopted it for internal use. “We worked with all the teams involved to collect and compile all the data available on each product’s life cycle. The tool provided an overview of the product, so everyone could work on their environmental impact, based on this information,” explains Sandrine Sommer. “We developed the platform hand in hand with Product DNA, because the traceability of a cosmetic product is complex, especially when it is composed of many ingredients,” she adds. Today, the platform lists 80% of every skincare formula’s ingredients, including key actives. The origin and function are also provided for every ingredient. “It is like inviting our customers behind the scenes. We do not hide anything, even if not everything is perfect. And it is an opportunity for us to explain the efforts we make about certain controversial ingredients,” says Sandrine Sommer. As regards packaging, the website both provides the suppliers’ names and geographical situations and highlights the outstanding actions taken to preserve the environment.  Users can also find information about transport, the carbon impact, the points of sale all around the world, products’ end-of-life, and recycling. “Being transparent means honestly and genuinely sharing our actions as part of our social and environmental commitment, and BEE RESPECT is an additional milestone in our sustainable approach. It also corresponds to customers’ growing need for more information about the products they use,” explains Guerlain’s Sustainable Development Director. Opened to the public since last April, the platform is accessible either by scanning the products’ QR Codes, or on Guerlain’s website, via the Bee Respect tab. Right now, it only covers skincare, but it will be completed with makeup products by this summer, and then perfumes, by the end of the year."
Capsum explores the green trend and invests in the US,"Every year, Capsum gathers customers to introduce a newly inspired collection of textures and formulas and highlight the potential of their exclusive microfluidic technology, which consists in forming droplets one by one, by controlling their sizes and manipulating fluids to obtain innovative emulsions. “These proposals help us explore different ways to innovate and stimulate our customers’ curiosity. But they are not turnkey solutions. It is only afterwards that we work on tailor-made offers using our technologies, according to our customers’ specific requests,” explains Laurie Dewandel, Communication Director. This year’s theme, Tomorrow Natural Glow, seemed only natural, given what all beauty brands expect: more naturalness and sustainability. “This new collection offers solutions combining naturalness, innovation, aesthetics, and sensoriality. It is an invitation to discuss beauty’s sustainable future. We made clear choices in terms of sustainability and we encourage brands to exchange with us about these issues,” adds Laurie Dewandel. For their formulas to be both natural and ecoresponsible, Capsum partnered with Le Paysan Urbain, an urban farming structure which develops agro-ecological farms in city centres or close suburbs for cultures without inputs or buckwheat sprout pesticides. The extraction of actives with a non-polluting, ultrasound-based technology is outsourced to Crodarom. The range is composed of an energizing essence, a comforting serum, a quenching jelly and a nourishing pearl cream, with rates of natural ingredients between 90% and 96%. In addition, Capsum has been working on new technologies to get rid of silicones and get as close as possible to 98% natural formulas. As regards packaging, the company has chosen not to use any plastic – except for the cap’s gasket seal – or glue. They selected secondary packaging made of folding board and pump-free bottles and jars based on lightweight glass. “It is the first time we have incorporated our bubbles in jars. It really transforms the cream’s appearance,” emphasizes Laurie Dewandel. Capsum will showcase the Tomorrow Natural Glow collection in NYC on May 14-16, and then in Los Angeles, on June 4-6, 2019. The company will use this opportunity to introduce American customers to its future production site in Austin, Texas. The LEED-certified ecodesigned building is under construction and should be operational in early 2020. “North America is an increasingly important market for Capsum. We had to be there, as close as possible to our customers. Plus, it is line with the global production relocation trend,” concludes Laurie Dewandel."
China is already Ioma’s second largest market,"How can a brand based on the concept of skin diagnosis – it claims more than 1 million of them so far, performed using in-store analytical devices –, convince people in a market where it is physically not present ? ""We have a local co-investing partner who develops cross-border e-commerce on different platforms like Taobao and Little Red Book. Because upstream, since September 2018, we have signed collaboration agreements with 30 KOL (Key Opinion Leaders) asking them to talk about us on Chinese social networks,"" explained Jean-Michel Karam. This practice of recommendation funded online - Zhong Cao ( 种草) or grass planting in Chinese Internet lingo - allowed it to generate promotional articles on the brand, coined for the occasion with a Chinese homophone name (ioma 艾欧码). A total of 260 local websites spoke about Ioma. And it is mostly live streaming, very popular among young Chinese consumers, that enables faster buying decisions. ""One of our influencers was filmed live performing a skin diagnosis of her skin in our Parisian boutique on Boulevard Saint Germain and in a few hours, 2,000 products at US$150 piece were sold,"" said Jean-Michel Karam. Trained as an engineer, the entrepreneur founded Memscap in 1997, a provider of innovative solutions and innovative products based on micro-electromechanical systems (Mems), mainly for the aeronautics and aerospace sectors. Convinced that these complex electronic components capable of detecting physical phenomena could have a disruptive application in the field of cosmetics, he gathered 45 million euros of investments in R&D technologies before launching Ioma in 2010. ""The personalization that a truly scientific and precise skin analysis provides, is the basis for efficiency. And this is the epitome of luxury,"" he highlighted. And in fact, the ""Ma Crème"" range, proposed in 40,257 possible formulas, is positioned at the higher end of the market. The next step was the launch, last January, of jewels, under the brand name Ieva, to measure the temperature, the level of pollution, humidity, noise, brightness and the UV index. The collected data is then translated into beauty, nutrition and lifestyle recommendations. ""Because half of ageing results from a genetic origin and from stress, the environment and lifestyle,"" added Jean-Michel Karam, who believes that beauty brands will gradually shift to more global well-being brands. Acquired by the Unilever Group in 2013, Ioma is present in more than 25 countries, ""China already being our second market, and our strategic priority after France"". ""We have had China in sight for four years now. In Asia, we have 20 POS in department stores in Singapore and Taiwan. And a six-month pop-up corner in Hong Kong,"" detailed the Head of Ioma. In the wake of this ""encouraging first phase"" on the Chinese Internet, ""with its influencers ten times more expensive than in Europe"", the opening of physical stores is scheduled for September 2019, after obtaining CFDA certifications. ""And this will be quite something. We will offer Chinese consumers a memorable shopping experience,"" guaranteed Jean-Michel Karam."
BODY’Minute to develop their concept in Europe,"Jean-Christophe David was the son of renowned hairdresser Jean-Louis David, who died last April 3, aged 85. He inherited a family passion for hairdressing, and 20 years ago, he banked on a wellness concept for women, in particular young women who were not used to going to beauty salons. BODY’Minute offers subscriptions for quick treatments without an appointment. Subscriptions also give access to the NAIL’Minute and HAIR’Minute services, which soon completed the network’s offering. “We offer high quality, affordable services for women from 15 to 45,” explains the founder. Today, the network ranks first in terms of number of beauty salons in Paris, and second in France, behind giant Yves Rocher. The group keeps growing – +7% in 2018, at constant scope – and achieves a 150-million-euro turnover for four million transactions every year. Five years ago, the concept was completed with cosmetics ranges to meet customers’ needs: SKIN’minute, EPIL’minute, SOAP’minute, SLIM’minute, BODY’minute, and BABY’minute. In keeping with its dynamics of 30 new openings every year, the BODY’Minute network aims to develop outside French borders. ""Today, we are definitely able to deploy the ‘minute’ concept throughout Europe,” says Jean-Christophe David. To this aim, the Director is looking for partners specialized in retail, and who can open new salons in the UK, Germany, and Italy. “The idea is to sell wellness to all women,” he claims."
"""Services are today a driving force for beauty sales"" Stéphanie Chalard","Premium Beauty News - What is the situation like for the Beauty Success network of perfumeries-institutes within the Group? Stéphanie Chalard - Perfume sales are on a par with the market trend, which is down, compensated on the one hand, partially by end-of-year sales and mostly by service activities, which are continuing to do well. Our website was also very successful. About ten branches were opened in France; the network today consists of 310 POS. Premium Beauty News - And outside France? Stéphanie Chalard - The export momentum is continuing; it stands as a growth axis. In 2018, we opened new outlets in Djibouti, Morocco, Reunion and Abidjan, which means today we have 23 outlets in the overseas departments and territories, Morocco and West Africa. Premium Beauty News - Services are becoming an important sales driver. What actions did you undertake in this area? Stéphanie Chalard - There is an institute in almost every Beauty Success perfumeries, this is our model. We have worked a lot on the profitability side. The card is made up of our own protocols with our own retail brand, which enables us to offer a very good price/quality ratio. The program ""Pretty, from mother to daughter"" has also encouraged daughters to visit our outlets, for a first skincare treatment or make-up application. Concerning the design of outlets, eight of them are now equipped with two entries: one for the perfumery and another one the beauty institute, to facilitate the access to the institute without having to walk through the perfume store. We are studying the possibility of extending this solution to all other existing outlets. In 2019, we will test a new store model with quicker service areas. Premium Beauty News - What are the major projects underway? Stéphanie Chalard - On the one hand, digital, with a completely redesigned website for September, with a stronger focus on our outlets, and a redesigned platform for making appointments in institutes. In addition, our media budget previously dedicated to TV, will be switched, to digital, with actions starting in May. The other important news is the Beauty Full Days retail brand, consisting of 15 institutes, that we are going to integrate in the ""Beauty Success L’institut de beauté"" retail brand as of June. We clearly wish to fully capitalize on the reputation of Beauty Success. This will allow us to broaden implantation opportunities on the territory and therefore reinforce our network and presence under the same name. This is an important change for the Group which will now consist of three main pillars: Beauty Success, Esthetic Center and Parapharmacies Tanguy, while keeping our two incubating nuggets: Beauty Sisters (for millennials), and Nicole (for the upper middle-class customer base). Premium Beauty News - Precisely tell us more about these nuggets? Stéphanie Chalard - We are going to open a new Beauty Sisters boutique in downtown Périgueux and a second Nicole boutique at the end of the year. These two young retail brands are just as important to us as the others, but they must first be tested in a branch format to validate the business model before launching it as a franchise. Premium Beauty News - And what is your assessment of the Nicole ""neo perfumery"" concept launched a year ago in Périgueux? Stéphanie Chalard - Results are very good with 30% increase in value compared to the perfume store that previously existed. It is a perfumery with a developed service that attracts new customers without competing with our Beauty Success perfumeries, despite some common brands. New highly demanded exclusive brands have joined us. Another finding, the institute we opened with Cinq Mondes and Pure Alttitude is very popular, and we are considering opening a second cabin in 2019. We also propose brands specialized in accessories, scarves, leather goods, jewelry, at different price levels, which are also very popular. Premium Beauty News - What would be your overall conclusion concerning the Group? Stéphanie Chalard - In parallel to the ongoing momentum of the Beauty Success Group, our goal is to win over new customers by working on our offer and communication, and always stay attractive to our current customers."
Meitu to develop own beauty recommendation technology,"According to Ian Wu, beauty online sales have reached a ceiling of 30% of the global market. To him, although they have always known the Internet, the Generation Z has not deserted physical stores. “The concept consisting in testing before buying is very important to them, and beauty advisors still play an essential role,” he said, as there are no other explanations than the relative stagnation of the share of online beauty sales. To stimulate sales in stores, Meitu has developed a skin analysis device. It is now possible to test customers’ skins at the point of sale and recommend them specific products. Meitu sells these devices to brands or retailers and offers a licensing agreement to use the associated software. “Our licensing agreement currently offers facial feature analysis, skin testing, and skincare/makeup product recommendation technologies. These technologies will enhance the retail experience by allowing consumers to better understand their skin condition and purchase the products that best fit their needs,” said Ian Wu. It seems the company has decided to focus on this type of software and to gradually withdraw from telephony. For example, last November, the group signed a partnership with fellow Chinese Xiaomi, who acquired the Meitu Smartphone exclusive license. “The deal will allow Meitu to better focus on developing its next-generation image processing, AI technologies, and image algorithms,” the group emphasized. The group is proud of its status of personalized beauty pioneer in China. Countless selfie retouch applications were developed in the country, after the launch of Meitu’s flagship application (美图, beautiful picture) and BeautyCam and BeautyPlus video applications – a range said to count 1.5 billion users around the world, including over a third outside China. For example, the My Beauty function on the flagship Meitu App allows users to personalize their beautification settings according to their preferences by logging into their Meitu Accounts (MTid). The criteria a user can personalize include, but are not limited to, the smoothness of the skin, the preservation of specific facial attribute(s) (such as a beauty mark), facial structure adjustments, facial and/or body reshaping, and eye size adjustment. Once set, these effects will be saved for all future logins and may be readjusted at any time. This analysis provides brands with insights into customers’: – Makeup and skincare product preferences
– Behavior, such as their number of SKU clicks, sessions, purchases, usage duration, and purchase rate
– Consumer needs based on their skin conditions such as skin age, blackheads, acne, dark-circles, and wrinkles
– Users can also choose to input their demographic information such as age and gender “All of these insights can be used to help businesses develop their marketing strategies and enable them to create multiple online touch points that can re-engage customers, or even reach a similar audience through precision marketing”, explained Ian Wu, to whom the targeted use of data is “the future of online marketing”. There is a last pending issue, though: personal data protection. Meitu promises that “the purpose and scope of our data collection is strictly limited to the normal operation of our products and their functions”. Quite a hot topic!"
CED Cosmetics unearths beauty gems for retailers,"CED Cosmetics has positioned as a brand consulting partner for the best-adapted distribution. “We aim to act as the local subsidiary they do not have and make suggestions about their expansion strategy and all the animation and communication actions it involves, so that they can last,” says co-founder Jean-Louis Schöller. To select these brands, CED Cosmetics founders Jean-Louis Schöller and Olivier Vinot defined a first criterion: “It has to be love at first sight, we need to have a feeling for the brand,” explains Jean-Louis Schöller. The following criteria have to do with compliance with French regulations, multilingual packs, an affordable price - no more than 10% higher than the source market - and of course, the products need to be trendy. “Naturalness definitely prevails today. Yesterday, it was the formula that was targeted, tomorrow, people will also focus on the pack. Sustainable packaging is a trend that is not fully exploited yet, compared to the expectations of the Millennials generation. Consumers want brands to be more innovative as regards packaging and material recycling. That’s why we focus our research on this aspect, now,” he explains. Right now, CED Cosmetics counts 25 brands in their portfolio, including Dr Bronner’s, OGX, Maui, Herbacin, Ikoo, The Humble Brush, Real Techniques, PureHeals, Adopt - for Benelux – and CoLab Dry Shampoo. “We provide an added value in the sense that some of the brands we unearth are far away, in Korea or in the US. Today’s consumers really search for talented, original brands. They want differentiating products, and they are fond of our own, in particular in supermarkets, because they can always get a premium extra,” adds the CEO. Mass distribution, selective perfumery, parapharmacies, department stores, drugstores and concept stores, organic stores… CED Cosmetics works with all channels to get more opportunities and put these new brands on the same level as the many players already on the French market. “Overall, we have always managed to make our brands settle on retail markets. Also, sometimes we launch them on exclusive terms at only one retailer. Brands are willing to stand out,” concludes Jean-Louis Schöller."
"Chlitina, the Taiwanese brand which is winning over Chinese customers","Chlitina now boasts a network of over 4400 franchisees in Greater China and Southeast Asia. The franchise generated more than 1 billion yuan (131 million euros or 147 million US dollars) in sales in 2018, 95% of which, in mainland China, making it the leading beauty salon brand in the region. The aim of the franchise is to achieve a net annual growth of 500 institutes, not only in the Greater China region but also in countries like Vietnam where it already has a foothold and soon in Malaysia and Indonesia. To ensure its development, the Company relies on its own R & D centers and manufacturing plants in Taiwan and China. This allows the Company to master the quality of products and their traceability and thus guarantee their authenticity. In-house development also allows for increased responsiveness on the market. Chlitina also has a training school in Shanghai and 27 regional centers spread across China. These schools train beauticians to skincare methods, but also to health practices and to the management of the Beauty institutes. Chlitina believes that 300,000 beauticians - i.e., about 90% of all beauty professionals in China - were trained by the franchise brand. The Company stands out with its feminist commitment and encourages women’s entrepreneurship. ""The brand seeks to help women emancipate themselves economically and to take a leading role in their family and community,"" said Ryan Chao, COO of Chlitina. Chlitina leverages on a Taiwanese concept of customer service and skin care. Beyond cosmetic treatments, beauticians are trained to the well-being of their customers and to the management and growth of their salons thanks to new selling techniques, with loyalty programs for their customer who generally call on their services three or four times a month. Beauty salons also communicate on WeChat, Line, Weibo among other micro-blogging platforms, etc. Everywhere, except in China, where the American social network is blocked, every salon also updates its own Facebook page. There is a profit-sharing scheme for salons on their sales of cosmetic treatments and products.  Supplies are managed in a just-in-time mode to limit costly stocks. Yet, customers are not only encouraged to go to their salons to benefit from technical skin treatments and get the beauty tips that the brand’s sophisticated products require, they can also buy online: Chlitina has created its own e-commerce platform to expand its range by offering the brand’s products, but also wellness products such as dietary supplements. In line with its development strategy, the beauty salon franchise brand is leveraging particularly on light cosmetic procedures (such as Botox injections, laser treatments, etc.) and has recently acquired a beauty care clinic in Beijing and announced that it would shortly be opening two more clinics in Shanghai."
Faber-Castell launches its clean beauty offer,"Pure2 Beauty is another step further in the development of a “clean beauty” offering presented at MakeUp in Los Angeles under the Pure Beauty seal. As the first opus, the new range of wood and plastic pencils is guaranteed without controversial ingredients (D5 silicones, parabens, non-sustainable palm oil, mineral mica, fragrances, etc.), and offers in addition vegan and natural (or greener) formulas, free from microplastics, silicons and synthetic waxes and with PEFC certified wood. ""The wave of clean beauty is encouraging brands to rethink their offering. With our Pure Beauty and Pure2 Beauty seals, we offer a clear reading grid for our ranges of pencils,"" explains Kathrin Hecht, Marketing Communication Manager at Faber-Castell Cosmetics. The Pure and Pure2 Beauty collections consist of 12 different colour cosmetic pencils, for eyes and lips make-up, with high performance and rich pigments. The Pure2 Beauty Divin Red Wooden Jumbo Pencil, for instance, offers a lipstick formula based on natural waxes and oils and vitamin E to help lips stay soft and hydrated. The colour-rich, creamy texture in deep, dense hues perfectly defines and fills in. The wooden Jumbo-sized pencil unites the precision of a liner with the convenience of a lipstick. For the pencil body, Faber-Castell Cosmetics uses PEFC-certified wood and the formula is free from D5, microplastics, parabens, silicones, fragrance, synthetic waxes, mineral mica, unsustainable palm oil, and is vegan."
Schwan Cosmetics reinvents itself with 3D-printed solutions and new designs,"The German manufacturer of wood and plastic cosmetic pencils is continuing the transformation of its offer and organisation.  After having introduced new airtight wooden pencils at MakeUp in Paris and a luxury a ceramic case at MakeUp in New York last year, Schwan Cosmetics has showcased new 3D-printed solutions and exclusive wood designs at the latest Cosmopack Worldwide Bologna. “Consumers all around the world are becoming less and less willing to compromise on their cosmetics products: They are striving for both individualized and instagrammable solutions, constant newness, sustainability and transparency,” explains Dagmar Chlosta, Chief Market Officer Schwan Cosmetics. In order to help cosmetics brands to address this new demand, Schwan Cosmetics wants to provide end-to-end solutions combining innovation, individualization and sustainability. In order to increase its agility and offer brands of all sizes fast prototyping solutions with unlimited shapes and geometry forms, Schwan Cosmetics has invested in new 3D printing machines. “We can therefore increase the variety of our designs within shorter delays,” highlights Dagmar Chlosta. The unit price of 3D printed caps and primary packaging is higher than for injected products but the technology allows to produce small quantities with no extra costs and to accelerate time to market. All types of decorations and finishes are possible. In the wake of the launch of Perfect, the first line of airtight wooden pencils, last year, Schwan Cosmetics is expanding its portfolio by putting the emphasis on design to increase the “instagrammability” of the products with two new lines: “Shifted Lead Next Generation” and the “Jumbo Chopstick Oriental”. In order to address consumer’s demand for more sustainable packaging, Schwan Cosmetics is also working at the development of a new refillable version of the Treasure Collection, the luxury line feature ceramic cases launched at MakeUp in New York last year. A new innovation to discover soon!"

Cosmetic subcontracting: Technature surfs on new consumer expectations,"It was a serious blow, but the company managed to bounce back beautifully. In February 2017, a devastating accidental fire burned to the ground the industrial site that Technature had acquired a few months earlier to Laboratoires Science et Mer. ""The next day, all of the Group’s employees got organized and focused on what was essential, namely to maintain production and fulfil pending orders,"" detailed Pierre Morvan, CEO of the Breton Company. Pierre Morvan makes no secrets of the fact the following months were difficult. But today he can only be pleased and proud of the long way his company has come from. Throughout this period, the French subcontractor retained the confidence of almost all of its customers, ensured continuity of production and maintained sales level. ""We very quickly started rebuilding the factory, while the offices had not been destroyed,"" he explained. Fully operational since the beginning of the year, the new building has a filtered air system, over-pressured in the manufacturing areas and a supply in filtered and biosmosed water to comply with FDA requirements. The production area spanning over 3500 m² (including 2000 m² dedicated solely to manufacturing and packaging operations) was designed to allow an increase of 1000m². Similarly, 1000m² of additional storage space remains available for the future. ""This reconstruction has already allowed us to increase threefold our production capacity and anticipate future production ramp-ups."" At the same time, production was re-thought to specialize the sites. Today, Technature can rely on two production units located a few kilometres apart, near Brest: in Dirinon, the historical 4500 m² unit now focuses on powders, while at Relecq-Kerhuon the reconstructed unit is dedicated to leave-on cosmetics. There is also a logistics platform of 5000 m² located on a plot adjacent to the Dirinon site. ""We hadn’t planned things like that at first, but when the opportunity arose we immediately seized it. This enabled us to separate the flows of raw materials and of packaging. This is also where are grouped all the finished products before their shipping. This enables us to maximize the space dedicated to production,"" said enthused Pierre Morvan. This additional space will also facilitate the upgrading works for the historic site, which have just begun, thus allowing Technature to have homogeneous units. With this solidly reconfigured industrial base, Technature can now entirely focus on winning over new customers. And for this, the subcontractor has a number of assets! Specialized at first in alginate-based formulas, the company has since, widely diversified its offering and now proposes a wide range of products, designed, produced and packaged in its facilities. Being the only manufacturer in Europe of hydrogel for cosmetic applications, Technature is facing growing demand for these products. New packaging lines are being installed and several innovations will soon be presented, including a natural gel from algae extracts. A COSMOS certified gel is even planned in the short term. ""Even though we never restricted our activity to that, Technature’s DNA lies in natural cosmetics. Our offer for natural products is fully in line with market demand and new consumer expectations,"" emphasized Anne-Claire Roudaut, Marketing and Communication Manager. ""We can rely on a well-developed expertise and technologies to meet market demand, which is sky-rocketing, including for our anhydrous formulas, in line with current demand."" Initially recognized for its expertise in masks, the company has successfully expanded its expertise to many other categories, well beyond the professional circuit. Technature, for example, supplied a glittery scented powder to Quadpack, who was showcasing a powder spray bottle at the last PCD Paris. ""What our customers expect from us are innovative and original textures. This is how we manage to stand out from the pack,"" added Anne-Claire Roudaut. Technature is therefore resolutely setting course on innovation with the aim of going even further in terms of naturalness and use of new materials. ""For our teams, we pay a lot of attention in preserving their moments of creativity and collaboration, with a lot of freedom to foster the emergence of ideas,"" explained Pierre Morvan. A strategy which has paid off so far. While the company’s activity was slowed down for two years after the 2017 fire, teams remained loyal and united. Technature, which employs 160 employees for a turnover of 20 million euros, half of which generated by export sales (25% in Europe and 25% for the rest of the world), wants to return to growth, with an ambitious target of 20% per year in the next three years. The company was identified by BPI as part of its national accelerator programme to become a mid-market company in the short-term. ""We have all the assets to succeed: loyal teams, innovative products in line with current trends, a high-performance industrial tool and significant production resources,"" concluded the CEO."
"Delbôve, a “magic ritual” in line with current trends","In the 1960s, Roger Delbôve and his wife Marion, who used to work for Helena Rubinstein, designed a skincare product based on medicinal plants to restore the skin’s balance and natural functions. It took the form of a ritual combining an Eau and a Crème, later called the Magic Ritual. When Marion died, Gina d’Ansembourg, who loved this method and its results, decided to revive the Delbôve brand and the formulas making up the ritual. A first wholly-owned store opened in Brussels in 2013, then a second in Antwerp, which helped reconnect the brand with its users. Delbôve is now coming to France. The Magic Ritual on which all Delbôve treatments are based suits all skin types and ages. Morning and night, thanks to the Crème Sorcière and Eau Sorcière emulsion, the three-minute ritual helps restore the balancing and regenerating power of the skin. This duo containing 19 natural actives becomes a five-in-one product: a cleanser, a makeup remover, a toner, and a day & night cream. As a complement, a range composed of 25 formulas “highly concentrated in botanical actives” offers both face and body care for specific needs. The Delbôve products are available at the Bon Marché department store and at the Liquides perfume store for EUR38 to EUR82."
"Fiabila, always one “stroke ahead”!","Premium Beauty News - Your trade requires continuous questioning! Pierre Miasnik - We do not have a choice! Our trade has become considerably more complex over the past ten years. We cannot afford to make mistakes, whether with the industrial tool or the products we make and place on the market. We must manage and, to a certain extent, anticipate stricter and stricter regulations, while offering ever-more innovative, high-performance, perfectly safe products for the brands we supply. For example, can you imagine we have over two thousand tonnes of flammable materials on a permanent basis in one of our main plants in France? Plus, we have 12 plants around the world. All our sites are fully compliant with environmental regulations. We recycle 97% of our hazardous materials, 83% of our total waste, and 100% of industrial wastewater is retreated. We have already proven, and we keep proving on a daily basis that we deeply believe in quality, excellence, and in the development of this nail varnish market. We have geographically diversified our production tools, and we keep investing in new techniques, thanks to our powerful R&D services. But nail varnish remains a beauty product, so there must be no compromise on creativity, which Fiabila keeps developing. Premium Beauty News - Over the past few months, people have been talking about a nail varnish consumption crisis. Pierre Miasnik - Well, we did have to cope with a cyclical market slowdown, but it is getting dynamic again. Obviously, the arrival and development of gel-based formulas, whose use is not perfectly safe, had a real impact. So, we had to innovate, and we did. We keep innovating with our 40 laboratory researchers. First of all, we need to ask the right questions… What do consumers want? What level of requirement, comfort, but also, and above all, quality and safety? We have been working this way for about three years in order to remove nitrosamines from our formulas, which led us to register three patents about the addition of inhibitors, bentonite substitutes, and nitrocellulose substitutes, respectively. Only the latter remains under study. The two others are finalized, and we are the only ones to offer a reliable, efficient solution. All this just shows that Fiabila is most likely the most advanced company as regards these technical changes, because we give ourselves the means to progress, in terms of production tools, consumer safety, and full compliance with the legislation, all around the world. Premium Beauty News - Precisely, let’s talk about this! Today, you have plants in seven countries. Alexandre Miasnik - That is what was said a bit earlier. We have geographically diversified our production tools to be as close as possible to our customers. We can meet the requirements of a very strict regulatory framework, but also of consumers, on a global basis, in line with their needs. And we are the only ones to be able to do this. It is the privilege, but also the difficulty of being number one. In Brazil, we cannot but be satisfied. The year 2018 will have been the first full year of production, and we have excellent forecasts. As a reminder, it is the first market in volume in the world, and its monthly potential reaches about 90 million units. Our plant is way above the local level. It employs more than 50 people who produce bulk and conditioned products on five automated lines. Besides, if our customers request it, we can double our current capacity. In Japan, we are building a new extension to enhance our storage capacity, and we have actually become the main supplier of this country. It took us no less than 18 years to gradually reach this rank. In the US, our position is the same and, as you know, we have invested as much as 23 million dollars there over the past few years. Today, we have a wonderful plant. Lastly, we settled in India twenty years ago, deliberately positioning ourselves at the higher end of the scale, which represents about 15% to 20% of the market. We are more and more satisfied of our presence there. We are still present in Mexico, which remains a dynamic market, and we are continuing our efforts in China, despite the very tricky regulatory context. Premium Beauty News – You have made “content”, but also “container” innovations! Pierre Miasnik - Exactly! We have been partly developing and registering our own packaging shapes for two years. It is an additional service we offer our customers, thanks to our technical service: they can draw a whole pack and have it developed by our suppliers. As regards packaging, we have just received a new filling machine in France, whose pace can reach 150 strokes per minute, so the line can produce about 100,000 units per day, with two teams working on it."
"""Green is the new black"" at Alkos!","With the ever-growing ""green"" phenomenon, cosmetic manufacturers are anticipating the new expectations of consumers who are increasingly checking on the origin of products and ingredients, the manufacturing conditions... Transparency has therefore become the rule in the beauty industry. With this in mind, the Alkos Group continues to imagine new sustainable and innovative solutions that respect the environment and its customers. Environmental and societal issues are part of the Group’s DNA, which has always been committed to promoting Made in France products. Its three plants are located in France - Alkos Cosmétiques in Boulogne-sur-Mer, Inter Cosmétiques in Angers and SAGAL Cosmétiques in Chartres. The Alkos Group produces all its products (pencils, make-up, skincare, soaps and sticks) in France, thus contributing to the local sourcing, involving most of the major players in the French cosmetics industry. The Alkos Group, which has been specialising in a full service offer for many years, proposes eco-friendly solutions both in terms of formulation and packaging, which are consistent with its CSR approach. After partnering with the RPC Group to offer a 100% Made in France Chubby pencil offering (reduced carbon footprint and shortened lead times), the Group proposes for its new range of ""Natural Beauty"" products, packs made of recycled materials. At Cosmopack, the Group will unveil a range of almost 100% natural make-up and skincare products in PCR tubes or bottles and a range of pencils with several textures, coated with cellulose! At Cosmopack, the Alkos Group will present for the first time a brand new technological innovation consisting of cellulose pencils made from recycled paper fibres. An innovative solution for a sustainable and ecological recycling. These pencils made of bio-based materials can be sharpened as easily as wood or plastic pencils. In terms of formulation the main advantage is that these pencils can be filled with either 100% natural ""Clean"" formulas or long-lasting waterproof formulas requiring an airtight container. An ecological alternative to plastic of course but also to wood, a natural resource to protect. Don’t miss the Cosmopack trade show, which will take place from March 14 to 17, and visit us at our Alkos stand (Hall 15 Stand E6D5) to discover all these brand-new innovations!"
IL Cosmetics wants to be perfectly in line with Clean Beauty,"As they strongly believe that, in the long run, actual growth cannot but be aligned with social development and environmental responsibility, IL Cosmetics have been strengthening their commitment and action. “Far from being a constraint, the group’s sustainable strategy represents both an economic driver and a source of inspiration and creativity for the teams,” claims the company. As consumers increasingly mistrust chemical products, in particular in the nail varnish sector, manufacturers aim to gain their confidence, to offer reassuring transparency, and to meet growing concerns about the safe use of these products. The IL Cosmetics group has committed to working with consumers, brands, retailers, researchers, and the industry to demonstrate the key role the chemical technology can play in the transition towards a sustainable planet and society. “A growing part of the population expects sustainable products, including nail varnish and makeup. Suppliers and brands get together to provide an answer,” states IL Cosmetics. Overall, IL Cosmetics has undertaken to develop their nail varnish and makeup portfolio, while limiting the environmental impact and ensuring the safety of the final consumer. The vast majority of products in the company’s portfolio can be highlighted as vegan, free from any controversial ingredients, not tested on animals and formulated with biosourced components. “Obviously, just like for all IL Cosmetics products, no compromise is made on quality and sensoriality. Both colour and skincare biosourced formulas go through the same validation process as the rest of the portfolio. New biosourced skincare textures (cuticles, nail strengthening, finishing) have actually just been added to the offering, so that the percentage of natural ingredients can reach 90%.” As regards makeup, the Vegalash mascara provides a Vegan Cruelty Free solution without any compromise on volume. Plus, it is free from any controversial ingredients and beeswax, and enriched in jojoba oil and shea butter. Endowed with the same product benefits, 90% of the company’s lip formulas (lipgloss, liquid lipstick, long-lasting, metallic formulations…) can be claimed as vegan, nano free, paraben free and mineral oil free. Of course, pursuant to the European regulation, all the formulas are cruelty-free. IL Cosmetics’s CSR commitment is based on four pillars, the first being the environment. It is conveyed by the creation of a range of eco-friendly nail varnish and mascara containing up to 90% natural ingredients, and by responsible waste and energy management. Over the past five years, IL Cosmetics has increased their waste recycling rate by 400%. Over 70% of their waste is recycled. As regards energy, water consumption was reduced by more than 30% between 2014 and 2016, thanks to new installations. Then, there is social commitment and business ethics. IL Cosmetics complies with the fair trade rules regularly used by competent professional bodies to assess them and maintain the excellence of their quality processes, sustainability solutions, and ethics. Lastly, the last pillar is the sustainable purchasing policy. Suppliers are selected based on strict quality and logistics standards, taking into account their social and environmental commitments. Everyone goes through this internal approval process and signs a charter for compliance with the ethical commitment of IL Cosmetics. Until 2020, IL Cosmetics aims to go on with this CSR strategy and further improve their objectives for each of the four pillars."
Unilever to launch Love Beauty & Planet in France,"The Love Beauty & Planet project was born out of the desire of a team of Unilever’s young employees in the U.S. to create the brand of their dreams. A brand that would take care of both people and the planet, with a reduced carbon footprint and a careful attention to every step of the production chain. From ingredients sourcing to the use of recyclable packaging made from recycled plastics and vegan formulas based on at least 98% natural substances: nothing is left to chance. In a market that is increasingly sensitive to ethical and environmental issues, natural cosmetics have become one of the main drivers of hygiene and beauty sales in the mass channel in France. Although they currently represent only a small part of the personal care market, organic and natural cosmetics are posting strong growth, thus forcing big brands to adapt their offer. In this respect, millennials are a very attractive target. This generation, which represents 25% of French households, but will account for half of the active population by 2020, is very sensitive to social and environmental issues, with a strong preference for ethical and recyclable products, with a strong attraction for everything natural. To appeal to Millennials, Love Beauty & Planet offers a positive and committed message, in line with the actions undertaken by Unilever for several years: ethical sourcing, in the food sector, and women’s self-esteem campaigns with the Dove brand, for instance. Nourishing coconut oil, moisturising essential oil of Bulgarian rose, ylang-ylang with an exotic and powerful scent, not to mention the purifying effects of vetiver and rosemary: the range boasts many organic ingredients, and paraben, silicone and colour-free vegan formulas, offering up to 98% natural ingredients. However, synthetic ingredients may still be used in order to offer optimal sensorial results in terms of fragrances or hair texture. As far as oral hygiene is concerned, the range includes bamboo toothbrushes and toothpastes with activated charcoal and coconut oil. Most raw materials come from ethical sourcing, thanks to Givaudan’s sustainable and responsible sourcing programs. All products use 100% recyclable packaging made from recycled plastics and featuring joyful colours, because pleasure is important too. Furthermore, to complete its eco-responsible approach, Unilever applies a self-imposed tax of 40 euros per tonne of carbon emitted, to fund a large European recycling program. As a result: a strong and bold brand, driven by a 100% digital communication in partnership with key influencers and communities, a range with a premium positioning, which aims to take a significant place on the natural market."
Essentia Beauty: Innovating to go beyond the boundaries of full service,"Premium Beauty News - What do you mean when you say, ""go beyond the mere notion of full service""? Katia di Martino - Our mission is to create unique concepts capable of meeting the expectations of a highly connected and informed consumer and accelerate their launch into the market. The single greatest challenge in beauty is just staying relevant and in the race. Given the way the beauty market is currently evolving, I think that agility is becoming more important than size now. We have shifted our focus from the corporate bottom line, to everyday human interests and behaviours due to the social media impact. That’s the consumer side of the equation that is currently driving the market. And it is through innovation focused on real consumer’s needs that we go beyond full service and develop beauty concepts integrated with AI and digital leverage. Premium Beauty News - Everyone pretends to be ""innovative""! Katia di Martino - True but today it is necessary to renew and regenarate the innovation process and that is what Essentia Beauty is doing. For instance, on ""Allmazing"", our web platform we use crowdsourcing to involve creatives in the development process. . Millennials are really the engine behind this new collaborative approach to idea making. I was 27 years old when I founded Essentia Beauty after having met a particularly talented formulator who lit the fire of my own creative potential. Twenty years later the ""Allmazing"" project has perpetuated the ideas I had in my youth and give voice to emerging creatives and professionals that will be the future of this business. We have to embrace challenges, as you know. Premium Beauty News - What is ultimately the best approach to make a difference? Katia di Martino - Marketing Basics dictate that the customer is at the center of the thinking process but, in practice, for companies, especially large ones, it is not that simple. To develop an empathetic relationship with the consumer, you need to put yourself in their place. This is well understood by ""indie brands"" such as Glossier or Merci Handy that find ways to involve their communities in their development process. Being ""Consumer focused"" means understanding the experience of the consumer, their desires and frustrations. They are sometimes banal everyday concerns that are beyond the limelight of the beauty world. Today the consumer has to deal with the paradox of an oversupply of cosmetic products that, at least superficially, seem to address all his or her possible needs. However, this same consumer is often unable to choose the right product from this ""disarray"" of options. Most women admit to having a hard time choosing their foundation and are lost amongst the myriad possibilities. We must provide solutions by understanding the root cause this consumer dilemma. This led us toward a targeted product approach. Along the way we incorporated artificial intelligence to match products to users. Today, we are the only full service company in the world to offer a personalized matching application based on facial recognition. This was pitched to ""native digitals"" who were immediately attracted by this kind of proposition. First it is a way of shopping that is familiar to them and secondly it better met their specific needs. Premium Beauty News - Environment, health, wellness: the new black? Katia di Martino - It is a fact that the consumer, especially the younger generation, is more aware of ""wellbeing"" and in search of forms of ""increased wellness"" for themselves and their community. This is a demand which reflects their desire to integrate ethical values into their consumption criteria. This explains the strong interest in ""clean beauty"" concepts imported from the United States, which combines the principle of safe formulation with ""cruelty free"" and ""eco-friendly"" requirements. But while this is all good news for people and the planet we must proceed with caution. For instance, 72% of millennials say they do not hesitate to switch brands if it does not correspond to their values. The old adage that what you consume defines who you are has never been truer. Essentia Beauty has been working on different research areas in order to provide customized solutions for different expectations. We’re developing both Cosmos certified natural and organic lines and we also work on the Clean Beauty new growing demand which we believe has a high potential of development. Regarding packaging we work both on refill solutions, especially for premium packs and on new eco-friendly materials. At ADF&PCD Paris we have unveiled a new cap that makes a real ecological contribution since it is made with a single bio base material and is biodegradable with a variety of finishing options and will keep working on exploring make up packaging solution using the same know-how."
IL Cosmetics puts the analytical approach at the core of their strategy,"The approach consists in carrying out and regularly updating an analysis of the main beauty players on the main markets. The idea is to analyze their volumes, positioning, prices, assets… and get a global vision of all product segments for each market. The study relies on external sources (Mintel, Euromonitor, Nielsen, etc.), but also on a consumer analysis based on a comparative, qualitative, quantitative, and digital approach that better assesses their needs and behaviours. This analytical approach results in a map of each market, so that brands can fulfil their objectives. Let’s take the example of the analytical approach IL Cosmetics applied to the nail varnish market. After several years of rapid growth, and then a drop in sales, the market is now stable. As a reminder, the nail varnish market fell by almost 50% between 2013 and 2018, declining from 6 billion units sold per year to less than 3 billion. The last fall was even more important due to various factors: – The increase in the market shares of gel varnish, which is also getting more stable.
– The ratio of the quantity of products purchased: 1 gel varnish bottle for four standard nail varnish bottles. This is due to the fact that almost all gel solutions are intended for professional use. IL Cosmetics supplies semi-permanent varnish and has been working on a solution better-adapted to the retail channel.
– A change in consumption habits. Women no longer change colours that often, plus they can wear the same semi-permanent varnish for several weeks.
– The pressure of category and brand management at points of sale. Priority is given to products with a better margin per square meter. The nail varnish category loses presence and visibility, given its low retail prices, compared to other product categories. Still, it should be said that private labels have either managed to strongly increase their market shares or become leaders on their respective markets. They have chosen a business model based on a partnership with a full-service provider that helps them enter the market with efficient, trendy, more competitive solutions and a much shorter time-to-market. By applying this analytical strategy to all their development priorities, IL Cosmetics managed to contribute to the success of private labels in multichannel distribution networks, in the segments of nail varnish, but also makeup, with their Luxcos dedicated entity, whose market shares doubled in three years. Perfectly aware of the crucial role played by customer insight, the company has adopted a customer-oriented approach coupled with a quantitative assessment. Digital data complete the analysis table to take into account the fast-changing trends and consumer behaviours. “Market research is at the core of our marketing strategy. It will help us strengthen our leadership on the market and consolidate our business units,” says IL Cosmetics. The Long Wear technologies developed by IL Cosmetics helped their customer brands gain market shares, despite the current downturn, and reach the first rank in Europe. To consolidate this position, IL Cosmetics went on with their research work: they will introduce new formulas based on a brand new process at the next Cosmoprof show. These Last+Light Catch’R formulas are designed to boost the nail varnish gloss and adherence performance. Meanwhile, following a rising trend, formulas increasingly offer Long Wear+Care benefits, as they provide both the performance required for a nail varnish and the actives needed to strengthen nails."
Natura Brasil launches a perfume line for Europe and aims to strengthen their global identity,"Premium Beauty News - What does coordinating innovation at Natura & Co consist in? Roger Schmid - We have set up a joint fundamental research project between the three brands, Natura Brasil, Aesop, and The Body Shop, based on their different Best Practices. These three brands come from three different countries and offer three different cultures, with all the wealth it represents, but we do share basic values: we respect both nature and its people. We share the same desire to think more deeply about new approaches to reduce the environmental impact or revisit beauty rituals. We need to devise a new generation of products and better educate consumers. It is all being gradually implemented. And yet, the Natura culture does not involve a global unification – each brand should keep its own DNA. Premium Beauty News - How can you stand out on a market that sees so many brands emerge based on the same values, i.e. environmental protection? Roger Schmid - If this approach to cosmetics becomes widespread, even better! Natura has never tried to stand out with these values to make profit: they are intrinsic and involve much more than competition. Our mantra is “Bem Estar Bem”, Feeling good together, and it is conveyed in many actions other than manufacturing cosmetic products. It has already been a few years since we received the B-Corp label, which certifies companies’ commitment for the common good. We work with local communities in Amazonia, in accordance with the fair trade principles, so we respect their cultures and know-how. Natura has had a neutral carbon footprint since 2007, and we have been working on transparency and eco-design. The Ekos range will actually be relaunched in the middle of the year to become 100% Vegan. It is already 50% made of recycled and biosourced plastic, and soon we will reach 100%. We will do the same for all our ranges. We certainly need to share even more about all these actions. They also target biodiversity protection, knowledge transfer within communities, etc. But our group’s culture is also about staying humble! Premium Beauty News - What about this new collection of eight perfumes, “Collages”? Roger Schmid - Likewise, it was designed in line with our philosophy, with 100% organic alcohol derived from sugar cane and a recyclable bottle based on recycled cardboard. Collages was initially launched in the US, where we have two points of sale and an e-shop. It will be available this summer in France, our bridgehead for our presence in Europe. These perfumes are not designed to be offered in Brazil, because the unit price – 85 euros – is too high for our local customers. The range is rather aimed to invite international consumers to discover our country through the inspiration and olfactory perception of the three perfumers dedicated to these creations. For example, with its warm wood, pepper, and musk notes, Madeira Branca evokes a Niemeyer-like, strong and modern architecture. And Dom recalls the roughness of southern Brazilian gauchos, with vetiver, cypress, and musk notes… Brazil is the country of perfume, so we were legitimate in developing this category in Europe. Premium Beauty News - How does the group intend to develop in Europe and globally? Edouard Macquart-Moulin - As a reminder, Natura Brasil is the leader in Brazil and Latin America, thanks to direct selling, the brand’s historical channel. In Brazil, we recently developed a network of about thirty points of sale to reach a different customer profile, without competing with our network of beauty advisors. In France, we opened two new points of sale a year ago, in addition to the store in Le Marais district. But, right now, we need some distance in France and Europe, so we are waiting before opening any new stores. As a complement to the e-shop, our strategy also focused on partnerships in different channels, online and offline (Birchbox, Amazon, Printemps, Beauty Monop). As for Natura Brasil’s global development, we are going to rely on the experience of other brands in the group (for example, The Body Shop is very present in Asia) to adapt our distribution method – direct selling, online selling, or stores – to the culture and maturity of our markets. In line with the brand’s globalization, the group has been working on revamping their visual identity with a new product and store design for next June."
TechnicoFlor aims to accelerate growth and explore potential acquisitions in France and abroad,"As their turnover rose by 18% in 2018, the TechnicoFlor group can boast strong performance, despite a tense situation on the perfume raw material market. “We managed to keep up our growth pace. But the pressure on the price of raw materials compelled us to make huge efforts. We had to swell our lead-time inventory and reduce our margins,” explains General Manager Patrice Rouan. To enhance its growth, the perfume house based near Marseille, in the south of France, benefits both from the strong growth of many Asian markets and a solid presence in the Middle East. Today, 75% of TechnicoFlor’s turnover is achieved outside France. The group has four production sites around the world, in Marseille (France), Shanghai (China), Miami (Florida, USA), and Jakarta (Indonesia), for a total capacity of about 2,750 tonnes per yearé. They also count business offices in Dubai and Singapore. Asia accounts for about 40% of total sales, and the Middle East and Africa region, 15% to 20%. Lastly, the company benefits from a consolidated presence in Russia and a few countries in Europe and central Asia. “Ever since the company was founded in 1982, we have aimed to develop our presence on the global level, by entering multiple markets. The idea was to accelerate our return on investment, while limiting risks,” recalls Patrice Rouan. To him, the company’s development potential is still huge. “In the short and medium term, we intend to enter new major markets, like Brazil and India, and to strengthen our foothold in areas offering a strong growth potential, like China and the US. Here and there, our development may involve acquisitions or alliances.” As regards North America, the company is about to restructure its business to secure a commercial presence in the New York City region by 2020. TechnicoFlor, whose motto is Creating is our Nature, perceived the potential of naturalness as soon as it was created, even when it was still a niche in the perfume world. The team is committed to exceptional perfumery, protecting both the product and the environment, and intends to become an expert in this field. The Natflor range by TechnicoFlor – 100% natural, Cosmos-compliant perfumes – has already become a reference for their customers. Meanwhile, to ensure both the continuity and quality of natural raw material supplies and a fair income for producers, the group developed a sustainable patchouli supply chain in Indonesia. And they are about to do the same with ylang-ylang in Madagascar. While the natural market is booming, TechnicoFlor benefits from a pioneering position on this segment. “We aim to offer natural perfumes with absolute creativity and quality, while protecting both producers and the environment. We offer a very wide palette, with a great variety of essential oils and isolates. Today, thanks to this diversity of raw materials and to the talent of our committed perfumers, we can create almost without any limits, including notes that would surprise you, like ‘100% natural gourmand notes’”, highlights Caroline Catherine, Development Director for the European market. The breadth of their portfolio of olfactory creations and natural raw materials helped TechnicoFlor seduce many of the greatest names in perfumes and cosmetics, with customers such as Unilever, Nuxe (both the Nuxe and Bio Beauté by Nuxe ranges), LVMH, as well as niche players, like luxury perfume house Ormaie Paris. “Every year, we develop creative books for various product categories. This way, we can make multiple suggestions, innovate, and keep inspiring both our perfumers and customers,” emphasizes Marketing Director Pauline Vesque. To maintain their lead in the field of naturalness, TechnicoFlor is considering an external growth operation in France in 2019. “We want to make strong progress on the European market and be more present for global players,” explains Patrice Rouan. They have already established contacts with operators in the French region of Grasse. In the meantime, TechnicoFlor will launch construction works for their new France-based plant in early April. The 12-million-euro project is aimed to double the production capacity and enhance the company’s reactivity and agility for delivery lead times reduced to less than five days. To be continued!"
The Beauty Partners supports new beauty brands on the French market,"Being the birthplace of cosmetics, France has the reputation of having a very competitive market, where it is complicated for new entrants to create an efficient direct bond with retailers. “Foreign brands are too far and do not benefit from any local intermediary, and young French brands do not necessarily have the means to form a sales team that could follow up their presence in stores or online,” explains Gabrielle Levasseur, founder of The Beauty Partners. “I felt like offering this local commercial intermediary solution between the brand and retailers, because when you are not out in the field to follow a brand, it just does not grow,” adds the former Sales Development Director Cosmetics of La Prairie and Guerlain, among others. To The Beauty Partners, a “commercial intermediary” ensures a field monitoring and guarantees key parameters: enforcement of the agreements signed with the point(s) of sale, compliant merchandising, a coherent brand image, trained sales teams, implementation of sales drivers, negotiation, active search of new prospects... The Beauty Partners provides this service for selective distribution (networks, concept stores, department stores), physical points of sale, and websites in France, Luxembourg, and Monaco. “We define ourselves as agents acting as intermediaries between brands and the selective distribution,” sums up Gabrielle Levasseur. The advantage of this sales force outsourcing offer is that it both helps these brands settle, sticking to their own image, and ensures they will last on the market through a strategy of visibility- and dynamics-oriented actions. Today, The Beauty Partners works with almost ten brands, including Ellis Faas, NCLA, La Brûmée, Lavandière de Provence, and newly arrived Italian skincare leader Collistar, now distributed in Marionnaud stores: the company helps them with product training. They also support natural Korean brand Pure Heal’s in the field. Thanks to high flexibility and affordability, The Beauty Partners adapts to the expectations of new brands increasingly present and popular in the selective channel."
Adopt’ aims to open 30 new stores annually in France over the next five years,"Premium Beauty News - Your offering was initially focused on accessories. How did perfume become a key element? Olivier Raulin - We observed a change in consumption patterns: today, people want simpler, more affordable, faster-changing fragrances. So, we chose simple, pure scents, like Coco, Vanille Gourmande des Antilles, or Ylang Ylang de Madagascar. The idea is to offer sober, interchangeable, travel-size (30 ml) perfumes that can be associated with other fragrances in the range and cost less than 7 euros. Now, we have 150 references which we regularly modify, and we plan one or two launches per month. Our simple, colourful packaging is identical for all references – only the juices and labels change. We make our products in France, in our plant near Bordeaux, and we work on juices with some of the greatest noses in Grasse. Beyond perfume, we aim to develop the notion of look through affordable cosmetics and fashion accessories. We target 20-30-year-old working women with an average budget. Today, each activity represents about a third of our turnover (perfumes, cosmetics, and accessories) – perfumes only accounted for 18% of it in 2015. Premium Beauty News - How do you communicate with your customers? Olivier Raulin - We do not use corporate communication for advertising, but we are very present on social media through partnerships with influencers. We launch co-created perfumes, and we organize events with influencers, like the 8th anniversary of La Penderie de Chloé. We are very active with our community: we share product creations, meetings with perfumer creators… All this helped us reach the 98th rank on the TubeReach barometer for YouTube in Europe (in July-August 2018), and the 143rd rank on Instagram, out of 500 brands, on the European level. That is quite interesting, because we are only present in France. In addition, we have just launched a new store concept at the Belle Épine shopping mall, south of Paris, where our customers can interact with a screen and fill in a questionnaire to get suggestions of adapted perfumes! See box. Premium Beauty News - What are your development priorities? Olivier Raulin - Our consumers are young working women. We are positioned in shopping malls, near fashion stores, but also in city centres. And we are very well-established in big French cities and their suburbs, with six points of sale in Marseille and Lyon, five in Bordeaux, and seven in Paris. We own 185 stores (190 by the end of 2019), including 40 franchises, mainly located in France’s overseas territories. Our turnover reached 36 million euros in 2017 and we sell one fragrance every 10 seconds in France. We intend to grow by opening as many as 30 stores annually over the next five years in France, and then around the world, on neighbouring, similar markets in terms of consumption, like Italy, Spain, and Germany. We also sell our products on the global level, thanks to distributors in China, Russia, Belgium, Algeria, Taiwan, and Dubai, among others. We boast key advantages to seduce foreign consumers, in particular in China, where we aim to open about 100 stores in four years. We would like to keep using an accessible language, with an approach based on the use, rather than on the technicity of perfume. Our range already makes it possible to use layering, a current growing trend, and we would like to develop this. On top of that, we have diversified our business by launching perfume derivatives (body care, shower gels, etc.) and boxes containing 125 ml bottles, together with soaps, shower gels, or body milks. Adopt’ is gradually finding its own place in the French landscape. We highlight our local manufacturing choice (France and Europe) to seduce our consumers in search of authenticity. A digitized store concept At the Belle Épine shopping mall, Adopt’ partnered with HMY to launch a digitized concept aimed to renew the customer experience. It is now focused on the brand’s three basics: perfumes, cosmetics, and fashion accessories.   Three innovations were designed and implemented: – The parfumothèque, the flagship feature of the new concept, is fitted with an interactive screen: after a few questions on her search, mood, and tastes, the application offers the customer a selection of three perfumes which light up on the wall to make it easier to discover the fragrances selected.
– Make-up stations enable customers to test the products they chose on their own or to ask a beauty advisor for a free makeup session or personalized tips. Thanks to the tablet under the mirror, the customer has access to various tutorials and associated product advice. The tables are fitted with cameras for customers to take pictures of themselves and share them on social media.
– There are screens in the windows and in the stores (on the walls and behind the cashdesks). The Adopt’ headquarters manage their content so it is adapted to the year’s events, commercial operations, and product launches. The products can be personalized in the stores."
Groupe GM in line with the dynamics of the hotel amenities market,"Premium Beauty News - Groupe GM seems to be doing very well. Stéphanie Thévenot - Indeed, we have achieved very strong growth over the past few years, both on the production and distribution levels. Business-wise, we have signed several partnership contracts with renowned global hotel chains, like Mandarin Oriental and Sofitel, and we have just been referenced in the amenities programme of one of the biggest world groups in the luxury hotel industry, with five of the brands we represent: Éditions de Parfums Frédéric Malle, Guerlain, Atelier Cologne, Codage, and Le petit Prince. In 2015, we produced 40 million tubes and bottles. In 2018, this figure reached 65 million, and we plan to make 85 million in 2019! To meet these new production requirements, we have invested 4.5 million euros to extend our French site in Lyon, dedicated to foaming products (shower gels, shampoos…) and emulsions, plus 2.4 million in our Portugal-based soap plant. Premium Beauty News - You have just inaugurated a new subsidiary in Hong Kong to enhance your presence in Asia. What are your next external growth projects? Stéphanie Thévenot - This new subsidiary in Hong Kong also covers Macau, so, in addition to China and Taiwan, we now have three subsidiaries in Asia, where we are present in most countries. We will now target new strategic markets, like India. Premium Beauty News - What about Brazil? Stéphanie Thévenot - Since the elections, there has been a new momentum, an acceleration. We have beautiful projects in this country. Premium Beauty News - Just like most manufacturers, you are facing an ecological emergency. Can you tell us more about brands’ demand and your strategy? Stéphanie Thévenot - We are at an ecological turning point, so we have been questioning our model. We need to think about new solutions, about a different approach to these single-use products. A few of our customers have already committed to this strategy, like Mandarin Oriental. They have embraced a zero plastic policy for 2019, and it integrates their amenities. All these major groups are aware of the emergency to get rid of plastic. As an answer, we have set up the Care about Earth programme: we undertake to reduce our products’ impact on the environment as soon as the development phase. More specifically, as an alternative for voluntary brands, we offer 300 ml Ecopumps with a plant-based bottle made of resins derived from sugar cane. We also make eco-sourced wall-mounted airless dispensers, which represent 58 times less plastic material than 30 ml bottles. Some of our packs are already based on recycled plastic, in particular our own line, Scandinavian White. Two other solutions are under study: they are based on additives which accelerate the decomposition of plastics chemical structure. As regards our formulations, they are already highly environmentally friendly, since they contain at least 90% natural ingredients – 92% for shampoos. Our formulas are Ecocert-approved and Cosmebio-labelled. Our soaps are 99% derived from plants and we are committed to using sustainable, RSPO-certified palm oil. Ultimately, we have been working on a Care about Earth formula containing no controversial ingredient. Last, but not least, we have developed solid formulas, in particular for shampoos. This plastic-free solution also helps reduce water consumption during the manufacturing phase. Premium Beauty News - What are your future objectives? Stéphanie Thévenot - One of our main objectives is to broaden our brand portfolio. It is a major ambition, because we endeavour to keep offering new services and exclusive products. Apart from the green demand, today, many hotels want to be able to choose among different luxury brands. Right now, we have about thirty brands, including new ones, like Courrèges and Caudalie, and a new, very important one will soon be announced."
"Dario Ferrari, Intercos: “Innovation is more than ever at the centre of the game!”","Premium Beauty News - The year 2017 will be remembered by Intercos officials as banner year... What about 2018? Dario Ferrari - We are clearly not in the same configuration. Globally, in 2017 demand was strong, especially in the field of make-up. This year, on the other hand, it was more difficult, and this is true whatever the place in the world. Yet, skincare has succeeded in staying afloat and if brand owners managed to achieve significant growth, it certainly due to this sector. What is driving the market today is both the prestige market and, geographically-speaking, the Chinese market where the skincare category has more than doubled from one year to the other. Europe is clearly at a standstill in terms of growth. Premium Beauty News - Did had to review your growth prospects? Dario Ferrari - That’s right! We had optimistically forecasted an overall growth of 14% for the Group, and we will eventually close the year at 7%, which is still a very good performance. Premium Beauty News - Innovation remains the main driver! Dario Ferrari - Always, of course! This is our strength and will always be in the face of competition. 900 hundred people are exclusively dedicated to this task in our 11 innovation centres around the world. An innovation management that gives fantastic results in Korea, Switzerland and the Netherlands a country where as you know, our laboratory in Maastricht works in close collaboration with a cluster of Universities and start-ups (nearly 150!). And the hot issue right now as you can imagine, concerns sustainability and clean beauty. We are working together on new products and polymers in a research and technology environment that clearly does not exist anywhere else. But we also work with two other universities in Germany and Belgium. Premium Beauty News - Packaging is a building block of your activity. Do you agree? Dario Ferrari - Indeed, packaging is clearly a very important element of our business. And the idea of improving our expertise in this field is always on the agenda. Integrating in the group a company specialized in this area is one of the options."
Olfaplay: Guerlain’s vocal app dedicated to perfume lovers,"Our first olfactory emotions, love stories, trips, outstanding personalities, exceptional dishes... These are all memories and emotions we can now listen to and share online thanks to this new podcast app that gives pride of place to sensoriality. In nine minutes maximum, everyone can share some of their olfactory intimacy, anonymously. Olfaplay stages what perfume finally does so well: recount stories. While synaesthetic processes around perfume abound, they generally only explore the link between smell and taste or smell and images. This new application that sublimates the emotional part of the perfume, through the sense of hearing is rather original. As Laurent Boillot, CEO of Guerlain highlighted, it is a way of ""giving life to memories conveyed by perfume, to transcribe invisible, impalpable emotions."" But it is also an attempt to federate the community of perfume lovers around audio creations, like blogs did, about a decade ago, through writing. Indeed, with Olfaplay, the aim is not to talk about the perfume offer in the Guerlain catalogue, but about perfumes in a broader sense. And actually, during recording sessions, it was not possible to mention names of perfumes; the idea was more to share some intimate memories, to go deep in one’s olfactory memory. Developed by Guerlain’s digital service in collaboration with Plink (for the recording of podcasts) and Octave & Octave (for the digital application), Olfaplay enables perfumes lovers to record one of their memories on the theme of their choice. But also to listen to those of others, filtering them by mood, or olfactory universe. Like other social networks, it is possible to “like” a story and leave a comment. New features could be added in 2019, since the app could be enriched with an audio message, to leave or listen to when someone offers or receives a gift for example. Next year looks just as exciting, since Guerlain also plans to develop an audio series around its 180 years of history, to develop an olfactory card in the manner of an audio-guide, or to imagine ""olfactory contests"" in order to meet people via the Olfaplay app. Quite a programme in perspective! For the time being, Olfaplay is only available in French but the app should be available in English in the course of 2019."
LF Beauty looks to the future of beauty under its new brand name Meiyume,"Premium Beauty News - Can tell us more about your rebrand as Meiyume? Gérard J. Raymond - That’s right! LF Beauty divested from Li & Fung in April 2018 and is now owned by the Fung Group (55%) and Hony Capital (45%). Since then, we’ve been on a transformation journey and believed it was the right time for us to take on a new brand identity that better reflects who we are, the values that make us unique, and our direction moving forward. Pronounced ""may-you-may”, which is a fusion of Mei (美), Chinese for beauty, and Yume (夢), Japanese for dream, Meiyume marks our next chapter with a renewed focus on our business strategy of (Em)powering Beauty Solutions. At the same time we took the opportunity to restructure the company into three key divisions: Packaging & Turnkey Solutions, Retail Solutions and Brands. Our company employs 2000 people across 5 production sites and 15 subsidiaries globally (including the US, France, UK, Germany, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, China and Hong Kong). More than just a name change, our rebrand represents a whole new philosophy and unique commercial and industrial strategy. The world has changed, and it is still changing every day at an exponential pace. The relationship between suppliers - like Meiyume - and our customers are and must be totally different. Simply producing is not enough to sell products to our customers, just like simply reacting to the needs of our customers will no longer suffice either. We have entered another world that’s digital and with fast-changing consumption habits where the old supplier and customer scheme no longer works. Moving forward, we need to empower and work as a collaborator with brands, retailers, start ups etc to help them find innovative solutions that shape their dreams into reality through experimentation & rapid prototyping. Premium Beauty News - Would you say that listening, understanding and supporting customers have become cardinal virtues? Gérard J. Raymond - In a way, yes you could say that. Rather than having this “supplier” mindset, we see ourselves as a collaborator. Customers today are forced to cope with huge constraints, truly unimaginable from just a few years ago, in terms of speed-to-market, quality, sustainability, social responsibility and consumer safety. Competition is accelerating Customers need support, advice, attentive listening and, above all, concrete results. Premium Beauty News - Can you elaborate a little bit more on this idea of Meiyume as a partner to its customers? Gérard J. Raymond - Our approach can be summed up by these four words: ""Try, Learn, Improve, Apply"". The idea is to create a true notion of collaboration with our customers by having them participate in brainstorming sessions where, through attentive listening, discussions and proposals, we then create solutions that are closest to consumers’ expectations. The key is to do this quickly. For instance, can we do in 9 months what previously took 18 months? That’s demonstrating our value. On our side of the partnership, we always adhere to the rule of never saying “I know”. Rather, our teams must listen, learn and start again until the right solution emerges. Our message to customers is: ""Trust us, we are here to find solutions. We are creating the right links to help Beauty take on its full meaning. We are much more than a, supplier we are your collaborator.”"
Henkel goes on the offensive in the segment of organic and natural beauty,"For the German multinational Group, there is no doubt that the hygiene-beauty market is undergoing a profound transformation. ""The drop in sales on the mass market has to do with two major phenomena,"" explained the Group’s marketing team in France. ""For 60% it is due to a phenomenon of de-consumption, in connection with concerns about products and the ingredients they contain and to the simplification of beauty routines, and for 40% to consumers migrating to other circuits."" To these two explanations, can also be added the ageing of the population, which is very noticeable in some European countries. Between 2016 and 2017, the share of consumers who said they had reduced their purchases and consumption of cosmetic and toiletry products, because of concerns on the quality of products, has jumped from 31% to 41%! This therefore is a particularly strong trend. However, some beauty routines and products seem to have played their cards better. ""Products like dry shampoos or micellar waters, which did not exist a few years ago, now have a significant weight in the market,"" said Henkel officials. The Group believes that the beauty market is undergoing  profound changes, driven by three fundamental trends: a desire to consume more wisely, with a varying level of commitment depending on the product category (from the mere rejection of certain controversial ingredients to a requirement for certified products, including a preference for natural products); the emergence of new uses and new targets likely to represent important growth drivers (seniors, women aged 35-55, men, millennials, multi-ethnic groups) and finally, the need to reinvent the store experience. The success of natural and organic cosmetics brands like SO ’BiO étic from the Léa Nature Group shows that it is the trend for a ""wiser consumption"" that is driving growth in many categories, particularly in skincare, hair care and shower products. Dental hygiene is in an intermediate position while hair styling products and hair dyes are  somewhat behind, yet, in these categories, things can change rather quickly as and when a new and performing offer appears on store shelves. In short, the takeover of small brands in terms of sales growth is prompting large groups to react. It is therefore on these grounds for ""a wiser consumption"" that Henkel has chosen to concentrate its offensive. The Group, which can already rely on an organic expertise thanks to the success on the marked of its Vademecum Bio toothpastes, believes that the offer is insufficient in supermarkets while organic stands as an important source of revenue growth in the hygiene and beauty segment. Following the launch of Nature Box, more specifically in Germany, Henkel is giving a new significant impetus to the repositioning of its offer with the launch of N.A.E. (Naturale Antica Erboristeria), a 100% organic variation of the Italian multi-category brand Antica Erboristeria founded in 1979 and which belongs to the Group since 2012. The positioning is clearly on a face-to-face competition with La Provençale Bio, launched by L’Oréal this year. All N.A.E. products are made up with a minimum of 97% natural ingredients and sustainability efforts have also been made on packagings. Bottles for the liquid soap are made of 100% recycled and recyclable PET, cardboard cases are designed with inks specially suited to meet the recycling process while tubes are made of plant based plastic (Braskem). The offer consists of 26 references in the average price line for organic products (from 4.5 euros). N.A.E. id being launched first in France (December 2018 and early 2019) and in Scandinavia, which are the most advanced European markets in terms of organic cosmetics. The brand will then be rolled out in Italy in the course of 2019. But Henkel’s offensive does not stop here. The Group is also planning to relaunch its Vademecum Bio toothpaste brand with a new reference for sensitive teeth and two references for children (1-6 year olds and 6+). The launch of a toothbrush with a 100% biodegradable bamboo handle is planned for May 2019. Most of the other brands in the Group will also go through the wringer of organic and natural. The cosmetic offer of Le Chat soaps for example, will be relaunched in April 2019. The new hand wash gels will be made of 94% natural ingredients, paraben free, mineral oil free and vegan certified. The Barnängen brand, which has snatched more than 1% MS in the French body care market in just 5 months, will expand its offering to hand care products. The Fa brand, whose paraben free and vegan line, Island Vibe, was a big hit with under-25, will consist of 90% natural ingredients. Interestingly, this realignment towards a ""wiser consumption"" was not necessarily met with an increase in prices, although some adjustments were sometimes necessary. ""Prices must remain affordable because what is also at stake with this wiser consumption trend is also to democratize it and make it accessible to as many people as possible,"" explained the Group."
Léa Nature to double cosmetics production capacity in two years,"Founded in 1993 by Charles Kloboukoff on the outskirts of La Rochelle, France, the Léa Nature group managed to settle as one of the main players in the fields of organic food and organic & natural cosmetics in just over two decades. In the cosmetics sector, the flagship brand sold in supermarkets, SO’ BiO étic, holds 28.3% market shares, which ranks it first, with a growth rate of over 35%. The Jonzac, Natessance, and Douce Nature brands, which are sold through specialized networks, also achieve a strong growth. All in all, Léa Nature counts 500 different references in skincare, hygiene, makeup, and hair care. Today, the group supports this development in line with consumer expectations by opening an ecodesigned plant that spreads across 6,000 m2 dedicated to the manufacturing and conditioning of hypoallergenic, hygiene, and beauty products. “The project was initially launched in 2010. At first, we had an 800 m2 manufacturing workshop within the company. But, since 2012, the permanent growth curve has enhanced the project with more ambitious objectives. It has turned from a workshop to a plant, an autonomous site designed around a process aimed to produce with a high reliability and quality level,” explains Julien Campion, the group’s Cosmetics Production Manager. “In 2016, we produced 10 million units. Now, it is 15 million, and in 2019, it will be 20. This figure already doubled in two years, so we need to get ready for this continuous growth, which corresponds to the market shares we gained from conventional products,” he adds. The site is divided into 4 parts: an area dedicated to manufacturing, which went from 250 m2 to over 1,000 m2, a 1,100 m2 conditioning workshop featuring five filling lines, 2,000 m2 for packaging and raw material flow management, and 2,000 m2 for administration offices and Quality, Innovation, and R&D laboratories. Faithful to its values, the group imposed a specific design and process to minimize the production environmental impact. They mainly focused on three aspects: water consumption, the discharge of effluents, and energy consumption. “The cosmetics industry is subject to critical water consumption, whether it is to make products with purified water or to clean up machines. We were committed to focusing on this point,” explains Julien Campion. The approach consisted in building a three-floor osmosis facility to produce 1,500 litres/hour of purified water, while minimizing discharge to the sewer. As regards tool disinfecting water, the idea is to optimize the various rinsing cycles, wastewater recovery, and pasteurization. Osmosis optimization will save 500 m3 of water per year, and 1,000 m3 will be saved as part of the cleaning process. “This model should make it possible to save more than 10% of our water needs,” says Julien Campion. The site will also be fitted with a treatment facility based on the “biological disc” technology to capture all effluents and treat them naturally. In addition, most materials are ecological: linoleum floors made of natural fibres, without PVC, or wooden floors, natural paints, and LED lighting. “If Léa Nature did not use to be widely perceived as an industrial reference in cosmetics, it is becoming one,” observes Julien Campion. Designed to evolve and get larger, depending on the group’s growth, the plant will be inaugurated in its first phase, in January 2019, and will start operating in April. It will help fulfil the production objective estimated at 21 million units in 2019, and then 40 million in 2021. It represents an investment of 20 million euros, including seven for manufacturing and conditioning equipment. “We need to be able to make both small series and shower gels in large quantities to match the diversity of our references. The challenge for this plant is to keep our natural flexibility, while satisfying the industrial capacity needs, so that the organic sector can keep booming,” concludes the production manager."
Cosnova enters the Brazilian market aiming makeup leadership,"After entering the US market, Cosnova Beauty will now be expanding their operations to Brazil with their makeup brand Essence. The German group has had Brazil on its radar for a few years and made its final decision last year, when its sales outside Germany grew by a record 18.6%, according to figures published by Nielsen. “We believe now is the time to do it. Brazil is one of the most important cosmetics markets in the world, so Essence will have many opportunities as it launches in the country,” said Tatiana D’Alessio Sombra, marketing manager at Cosnova Brasil. “We are very excited and confident that our new Brazil operation will help us achieve our goal of becoming the leading cosmetics company worldwide in terms of volume.” In Brazil specifically, the goal is to have Essence figure among the top five leading industry companies within five years. The company has opted to ship all products directly from Germany to set up their brand-new operations in Brazil. Essence outsources all manufacturing, since it does not have production plants of its own. In Brazil, it will start by selling around 300 of their nail, lip, eye and face makeup products (out of a portfolio consisting of more than 800 products). The diversity of the Essence product range, which is geared towards younger consumers, is one of the brand’s main assets to stand out among the competition already in place in Brazil. “Our business model is based on innovation - 50% of our portfolio is renewed every year. We also launch limited editions every two months. Brazilian women traditionally like having this much variety, because they are always in search of new products,” said Sombra. According to her, approximately two-thirds of all company employees work in innovation, analyzing and researching the main global fashion and beauty trends, as well as consumer behavior and desires, in order to develop new product lines. “It is an ongoing, rigorous process.” Sombra also said that Cosnova Beauty has already determined the items that will be launched or discontinued in its two upcoming six-month collections. Essence’s other big draw is its price-point. The company assures it will be maintained its reasonable prices in Brazil, despite the recent rise in the US dollar exchange rate and the high import duties levied on foreign products. “Essence’s market positioning will be strategic and competitive, with accessible prices, starting from R$ 5.90 for nail polishes and going up to R$ 42.90 for liquid foundation,” said Sombra. “We are investing long-term in Brazil, and our plans will not be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate. Our production scale offsets our import duties.” To distribute its products in Brazil, Cosnova Beauty has formed partnerships with local companies. A logistics company will import and disembark all products, while a second company will be responsible for product storage. According to Sombra, product distribution in Brazil will follow the company’s international commercial planning guidelines, with items being sold at drugstores, department stores, cosmetics stores, fashion chains, and online shops, as well as through their very own e-commerce platform. Currently, Essence products are available at large cosmetics stores in São Paulo, such as Sumirê, RaiaDrograsil’s online shopping platforms and the website Beleza Web. In 2019, sales will be expanded to Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo, after which they will go nation-wide. Sombra also said that in the near future Cosnova Beauty will start looking for local partners to develop and manufacture their products directly in Brazil. “We want to effectively identify and address the needs of Brazilian consumers,” she said."
IL Cosmetics is stepping up a gear!,"""When you observe such a sharp and rapid decline in a market like nail polish and when you see that it is not only cyclical but structural, not that many solutions are available, you have to change gear and make the right decisions,"" explains Jean-François Harpes, President of IL Cosmetics. Some solutions had already been implemented in the past by the Luxembourg firm. Like for example, the diversification towards make-up products started as early as 2003, or in terms of logistics, with the decision to relocate the filling and packaging operations in more competitive countries  (Poland and Bulgaria). ""As you know,"" says Jean-François Harpes, ""we haven’t stopped modernizing our historic industrial site in Luxembourg by increasing its capacity. We also have a new R&D centre. But at the same time, we absolutely needed to increase our filling capacity. This allowed us to double the size of our Polish factory and to open a brand new production site in Bulgaria. This site also has an oversized logistics platform. A unit which can be used to package other products in our make-up range, especially mascaras and lip gloss, and which will also enable a future expansion for the production of nail polish and gel polish."" In Poland (25 packaging lines over a 12,000 m² production area), the firm mostly packages nail polishes and some make-up products. While Bulgaria (10,000 m²) is more focused on the packaging of make-up products. ""Regarding the nail polish market, the finding is clear and irrevocable. Gel has become unavoidable. Its development has radically changed consumer habits. It obviously changes the quantities of nail polish produced in the world. We therefore decided to offer a complete range of Gel Polish. Compared to other popular products on the market, our products offer the same glossiness, holding power and ease of removal but at a much more competitive price. One of our strong points is that our colour approach allows us to offer the entire nail colour sample library (seasonal, trend editions, special effects...) in a gel polish version,"" details the Head of IL Cosmetics. As for the make-up approach, Dr. Christophe Delas, Head of the Luxcos entity, wanted it to be specifically focused on the lips, eyes and face. Mascaras developments for example focus mostly on volume with a clear R&D work to increase separation / definition. In general, whether for cream mascaras or waterproof mascaras, vegan products add up to the performances mentioned above. ""On the side of lip products, whether for long-lasting matte formulas or glossy formulas, the R&D work (formula and / or colour) is based on common guidelines. That is to say, always more payoff and comfort, and gliding formulas, that remain homogeneous upon application,"" he explains. ""For matte formulas, we are working on products that do not dry the lips. For glossy formulas, again we must avoid both a feeling of heaviness and a thick or sticky film and work on an optimum shine. Note that we are also working on formulas that blur lip imperfections or even give them a plump effect (without using ingredients that give a stinging sensation). Finally for foundations, what matters is the holding power and comfort with a strong skincare orientation."" This is obviously a ""key asset"". The Luxembourg firm is keen to highlight its Made in Luxembourg expertise, which, according to Jean-François Harpes, allows a perfect balance between rigour and creativity. ""We have invested a lot in this area,"" he says, ""by creating a real pole of colour expertise for all the products in the Group’s portfolio, by creating independent Marketing / R&D Business Units for each product category, the whole of it in a multicultural environment (marketing and sales) which is a real plus to understand the needs of the different markets. As for rigour, the fact that all the products manufactured are in strict conformity with European regulations is a real seal of guarantee. It is a batch to batch guarantee of reproducibility. It is also a commitment to quality through a complete system of procedures and of objectified consumer panels. It is finally also the proof of an industrial know-how and of a full service approach enabling to offer Made in Luxembourg products at a very competitive price."""
My Beauty Community lets consumers speak,"Today, the application is part of the Top 3 beauty apps on Android and keeps widening its community circle: it already counts almost 50,000 downloads. The founder, Marine Chevalier, started from the simple observation that an increasing number of consumers are interested in sharing their opinions on cosmetic products online. However, these comments raise suspicion and create restraint among people in search of advice who think they are often biased, due to the influence of brands on certain platforms. “In 2017, over 70% of consumers visited online platforms before making a purchase, but 90% of them had doubts about the authenticity of the reviews they read. So, I wanted to create a genuine, neutral platform where real customers would talk about Beauty,” she explains. Following a ten-year professional marketing career at Doux Me, Birchbox, and Sephora, and after creating and maintaining a beauty blog, Marine Chevalier benefitted from a 360° vision of the industry. In 2017, she partnered with computer scientist and technical director David Moothen to launch My Beauty Community, based on the idea that people would share their opinions within a community of subscribers. The user shapes up their own profile by answering a few questions to be able to exchange with other community subscribers with a similar profile. “We suggest other profiles of users sharing the same problems and interests, so that they can create a bespoke community to their own image and receive authentic, relevant reviews,” adds Marine Chevalier. Then, they can have conversations about products, needs, tips, or flops, and they can share their own favourite products and make recommendations. The more active the user, the more points they get in their own kitty, which gives them priority access to product tests at home or to various event experiences. The lucrative side of the concept lies in the test campaigns, which are accurately targeted according to the beauty profiles of a community. “We have extremely precise data and we know our subscribers very well, which helps brands very accurately target individuals based on 30 profiling questions, but also on their activities,” says the co-founder. Personal data are absolutely never transmitted to brands. “As regards test campaigns, it is not the brand that manages the shipments to our subscribers’ postal addresses, it is a supplier,” she adds. Based on these data, My Beauty Community also conducts  ad hoc researches at the request of brands . The website generates 250 spontaneous posts per day on average, which represents a valuable source of information for them. The other profitable part of the concept relies on the membership to various platforms: it gives access to product flows suggested to the subscribers willing to buy a product directly on the distributor’s website. So far, 60,000 product references have been made available through the Sephora, Feelunique, Nocibé, or Yves Rocher catalogues. “What is also differentiating is that we put people in contact with each other, and they help each other, for example by recommending products. We do not take part in this, we do not push products. And it corresponds to our vision: it is much better to be advised by someone authentic,” explains Marine Chevalier. Today, My Beauty Community mainly reaches the Millennials generation and is developing in France, Benelux, and North Africa. Right now, they are raising funds for the application, which should be deployed on the global level."
Nichebox: A new fund to help independent brands develop,"Former Director of Perfume Holding, Dino Pace founded Nichebox thanks to the support of private investors and of a Swiss fund. He aimed to be positioned as a partner, rather than a purchaser of brands with a strong potential on the growth-driving niche market. “We travel the world in search of brands with a unique signature, a story to tell, and a strong concept,” he explains. “We are not only a financial investor, we also offer our thorough expertise, while keeping the founding creators in the driver’s seat to ensure the continuity of the concept,” he adds. Liquides Imaginaires perfectly matched this profile, so they became the first brand to join the Nichebox portfolio. Dino Pace intends to partner with founders Philippe Di Méo and David Frossard, who are still shareholders and respectively General Manager and Artistic Director, in order to make various investments in digital communication, product development, and commercial initiatives. “We have great ambitions for Liquides Imaginaires. This brand has a huge potential, in particular in China,” says Dino Pace. In fact, the brand will open several wholly-owned stores in China by the end of the year and inaugurated a first flagship store in Beijing on October 26. As for Nichebox, they should announce new purchases before 2018 ends. Independent perfume and cosmetics brands with a strong growth potential are increasingly attracting investors and major groups, because they are seen as a way to accelerate growth. The Cattleya Finance S.A. fund from Luxembourg, the holding investment company owned by Benjamin and Ariane de Rothschild, has just taken hold of Caron, one of the oldest French perfume houses. And as for Silvio Denz, president of the board of directors and majority shareholder of the Lalique Group, he has told Swiss magazine Finanz und Wirtschaft he has been looking for small perfume brands likely to offer “good margins”."
"“Organics and probiotics are the main skincare trends today,” Bridget Carmady founder of Clémence Organics","Premium Beauty News - What is the history behind the creation of Clémence Organics? Bridget Carmady - Part of the reason I began making my own products was because I wanted to know that what I put on my skin could in no way cause me any harm. I lost both my father and sister to cancer, and their stories fortified in me a passion for nurturing health and reducing cancer risk wherever possible. The role that skincare plays in health may seem small and insignificant for some, but when the body absorbs around 80% of what we put on it, I don’t feel we can take it too lightly. I know for me, having full confidence in what I put on my skin (and therefore in my body) makes me feel that I have at least taken control of that aspect of my health. I also wanted my naturopathic clients to have the best products for their skin that were gentle and made from organic ingredients but still able to deliver powerful results for their specific skin conditions. My clients loved the products I made for them and because of this the skincare side of my business grew quite quickly. Pretty soon I had to decide between my naturopathic practice and making organic skincare. My heart was pulling me towards Clémence and so I launched it as a stand-alone skincare brand in 2016. Premium Beauty News - What is your background?  Bridget Carmady - I studied a Bachelor of Naturopathy and then went on to do my Honours degree in Health Medicine. I use this naturopathic approach when it comes to creating my products. Naturopathy is a practice of medicine that is based on the body’s inherent ability to heal itself. Therefore, each Clémence Organic product is formulated to support the body’s own healing process, using both traditional and scientifically validated nutritional medicine and herbal medicine. Premium Beauty News - Where are your products available? Bridget Carmady - We are currently only available in Australia but ship internationally via our website. Our distribution is expanding, with Asia soon to come on board, and Europe and the USA within the next two years. Premium Beauty News - What are the biggest trends you are currently addressing?  Bridget Carmady - Organic is definitely on trend with more people becoming aware of the benefits both for their general health and for the health of their skin. Probiotics in skincare is also trending, and so we jumped on this with our latest product, Ultimate Biome Spritz. Premium Beauty News - What are the most challenges you are facing? Bridget Carmady - I think the biggest challenge is teaching customers that natural and organic skincare can be highly effective for a range of skin conditions, sometimes even more effective than conventional skincare. Premium Beauty News - Do you have any investment planned? Bridget Carmady - With expansion into Asia on the horizon, we are investing money into increasing our production capabilities. We are also investing in brand awareness, utilising influencers on social media to share the message of our brand."
Subcontractors: Pharma & Beauty Group and Cetes Cosmetics join forces,"The two companies have plans to create a joint venture under the name Pharma & Beauty International (PBI), with Cetes Cosmetics as a minor shareholder Thanks to the complementarity of their two production networks and of their customer portfolios, the two companies intend to position PBI as a new global cosmetic subcontractor in order to meet the increasingly diverse needs of beauty brands around the world. Created in 2012 by Laurent Dodet and Jean-Marie Total, France’s Pharma & Beauty Group operates four factories in France and specializes in the manufacture and filling of cosmetic (skincare, make-up, perfume, hygiene) and pharmaceutical products (medical devices, pharmaceuticals) and dietary supplements. Pharma & Beauty Group has a strong position as a contract manufacturer in France. For its part, Cetes Cosmetics is the manufacturing arm of Swedish cosmetics group Oriflame. Established in 2017 with headquarters in Schaffhausen, Switzerland, Cetes Cosmetics has six plants in four countries (Poland, Russia, India and China). The company manufactures cosmetic products for both Oriflame and for external third-party customers. PBI will be incorporated in France with headquarters in Paris and will be headed by Laurent Dodet as CEO. “With PBI we will bring together the best from both partners; global footprint, wide range of technologies, breakthrough innovations, high-quality factories and a dynamic experienced management. PBI will be able to offer clients flexible production solutions in the combined 10 factories of both joint venture partners,” said Laurent Dodet in a release."
Marie Claire Group to speed up diversification in beauty,"Thibaut Fougeras created France Lab ten years ago after a marketing and management career at the L’Oréal and LVMH groups. He got the idea of offering brands and companies willing to develop their own product lines a “one-stop shop” that would gather all the skills needed for it under one roof. As a result, today, France Lab activities cover R&D – they have got their own formulation laboratory –, marketing, design, regulatory affairs, manufacturing, and quality, with either a full-service or tailored offering. “Our positioning is tailor-made beauty delivered as fast as possible. And we focus on high-end, sophisticated, complex, and innovative projects in all product categories,” explains the founding President. “Our strength lies in our ability to talk marketing and R&D at the same time - these two dimensions are key to make a product original and successful,” he adds. France Lab has another asset: they joined the Marie Claire Group in 2015, which helped them broaden their scope of action to the group’s many customers on the global level. “Marie Claire is one of the most famous French brands in the world. The group is at the core of global cosmetics trends and is present in 30 countries. Now, we have access to all these sources of information, and it is extremely precious for us to create our products as well as for our customers,” says Thibaut Fougeras. Under the impetus of Thibaut Fougeras, the Marie Claire Group completes the France Lab strategy to seduce all customer types on the global stage. Already present in New York City, France Lab will inaugurate brand new offices in Shanghai by the end of the year. “This means we will be done with our international expansion, bearing in mind that over half our customers are based abroad,” comments the Director. At the heart of the Chinese metropolis, the new offices will be designed like in Manhattan: a whole ecosystem housing both the France Lab services and an incubator space for innovative start-ups to develop. This initiative is perfectly in line with the group’s second ongoing project: the creation of Marie Claire Beauty Ventures, a new investment structure to help promising young cosmetics start-ups break through. “We are on the look-out for promising concepts, wherever they be. This strategy is coherent with the new market situation – there is a revolution going on. We aim to make a difference by identifying these innovative projects very early, and then supporting them with the whole ecosystem they need to succeed. We have already acquired holdings in the Prose and Loli brands in the US and provide them with full support in our offices in New York City,” explains Thibaut Fougeras. Lastly, the group has just purchased two industrial sites in France: ABO Cosmétiques is based in Mantes, west of Paris, and specialized in cosmetics manufacturing and packaging, while Cegedis is based in Chartres, south-west of Paris, and specialized in perfumes manufacturing and packaging. This acquisition involves their logistics platform that can store and ship products all over the world. The idea is to add yet another string to Marie Claire’s bow, by reaching customers willing to directly exchange with a plant, without going through the development phase offered by France Lab. “These super agile plants are not meant to become France Lab plants, quite the contrary. France Lab will keep working with their historic network of industrial partners to offer customers the best solution possible. These plants’ development approach consists in searching for global brands that highlight made in France products and want to produce in France. As a result, every company will keep growing independently, but as a complementary entity within the group.” With this new beauty division, the Marie Claire Group intends not only to pursue their mission of serving beauty players, wherever they be in the world, but to expand it."
Birchbox and Walgreens team up to offer multichannel beauty experiences,"In a move to expand its beauty aisles by including high-end cosmetics to its assortment of products, Walgreens has taken a minority stake in subscription-box company Birchbox. For its part, the beauty e-retailer will have the opportunity to expand its physical presence across the USA. Birchbox has claimed since the opening of its first physical store in New York that the development of its physical presence will be key to its growth. The company has been facing competition from both pure players and more traditional beauty retailers, such as Sephora, and has seen online growth slowing but continues to report “over 2.5 million” active users. The first six Birchbox-branded Walgreens beauty departments are scheduled to open in December of this year in New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Minneapolis. And in early 2019, Walgreens will add Birchbox shops to five more stores in Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, and Miami. In addition, a curated Birchbox shop will be added on Walgreens.com. “Our customers want to shop the most sought-after brands in a welcoming and accessible environment, and the addition of Birchbox to our growing beauty offering is a big step in delivering on our promise to differentiate and elevate the beauty experience at Walgreens. This collaboration will help enable Walgreens to continue to strengthen our beauty offering and build our prestige portfolio,” said Richard Ashworth, President of Operations, Walgreens. The in-store Birchbox experiences within Walgreens will have dedicated space with Birchbox branding, elevated design and a curated product assortment featuring full-sized skincare, hair and makeup products from more than 40 prestige brands. Birchbox-trained Walgreens Beauty Consultants will be available to offer advice and guide the customer through the experience. Additionally, within the Walgreens pilot stores, Birchbox will offer subscriptions to its monthly delivery services of personalized samples and a “Build Your Own Birchbox” experience (BYOB), which is a signature element of Birchbox’s flagship stores in New York City and Paris. “In Walgreens, we have found an exciting partner that supports our mission of reaching an underserved customer who doesn’t prioritize beauty,” said Katia Beauchamp, CEO and Cofounder of Birchbox. “Birchbox has effectively changed the relationship that this customer, who represents 70 percent of the market, has with beauty and increased her spend in the category. Walgreens is deeply committed to beauty and shares our vision for a different type of retail experience - one that is holistic, seamless and designed to help shoppers make informed, confident decisions. Together we will continue to evolve the integration of our physical and digital shopping experiences.”"

Vittoria Cicchetti - We have constantly been investing in makeup innovation, creating our formulas and anticipating new trends.  Our unique style was perfectly synthetized and communicated through our characteristic pink thinking.  Time is up now to show how creativity and technical mastery can move ahead in harmony.

Premium Beauty News -Are you satisfied with your results? Vittoria Cicchetti - Regi US is expected to more than double its turnover year on year in 2018.

We are going to broaden our range of available products and support our customers with all our expertise. Regi Italy is projected to grow revenues by one third in 2018. A brand-new production unit, right next to the current headquarters, will be ready by the last quarter of 2019 with groundbreaking technologies and innovative industrial processes.  Wait and see what we have in the pipeline… Regi India has been constantly improving its production capacity, equipment and know-how since its opening in 2009, and the same positive trend is expected this fiscal year, As you can see, being global also means investing in all our units, so that the Italian, US and Indian sites manage to grow and evolve according to the local needs, turning effectively into practice the old and sometimes abused saying: think global, act local. This is what a global company does."

Pierre Fabre invests to better meet the needs of Brazilian consumers,"Covering an area of 320 sq. metres, Pierre Fabre’s new dermo-cosmetics innovation centre is located in the district of Barra da Tijuca, in Rio de Janeiro, and has a branch at the group’s industrial facility in Areal, in the state of Rio de Janeiro. It will have around twenty researchers and technicians by 2021. Headed by Anne-Laure Gaudry under the responsibility of Xavier Ormancey, Director of Dermo-Cosmetics (PFDC) Division R&D, the Brazilian Innovation Center of PFDC will pursue a three-fold mission:
– to better understand Brazilian skin types from a dermatological point of view as well as the sociological needs of Brazilian consumers,
– to detect in advance upcoming trends in the Brazilian cosmetics markets, “one of the most sophisticated and inventive in the world,” according to Pierre Fabre,
– and to boost the development of new products adapted to the local market for the Eau Thermale Avène, Ducray and Darrow brands. “The Brazilian dermatological school is famous all over the world. The Brazilian population has an incredible mix of skin and hair types and Brazilian consumers are particularly sophisticated and demanding when it comes to cosmetic products. It was therefore natural for PFDC to set up its second international innovation center in this country, and I am confident that its teams will develop formulas and products that will be appreciated first locally and then beyond Brazilian borders,” explains Nuria Perez-Cullell, CEO Dermo-Cosmetics Division. As the world’s fourth largest cosmetics market, Brazil is of major importance for the Pierre Fabre Group. In 2017, the products marketed by Pierre Fabre do Brasil achieved consumer sales in excess of BRL 300 million (EUR 62 million), up 10% compared to the previous year. Even if this figure represents only a small part of the group’s global sales (2.3 billion euros, including 1.4 billion euros for the dermo-cosmetic branch), Pierre Fabre is - with its brands Eau Thermale Avène, Darrow and Ducray - the 3rd player in the Brazilian dermo-cosmetic market. With a presence in Brazil since 1985, the Pierre Fabre Group is now developing both its pharmaceutical and dermo-cosmetics businesses here. Following the acquisition of Darrow Laboratories in 2006, the Group owns a plant specialized in the production of dermo-cosmetic products in Areal. “Brazil is a country of strategic interest for our Group and Pierre Fabre do Brasil is one of our most dynamic subsidiaries with an average annual growth of 24% over the past five years. In 2015, we launched a major investment plan to the tune of 50 million real, notably to modernize our Areal plant. We are furthering this effort today by opening our second international innovation center in Rio de Janeiro. It is a great opportunity for us to welcome Brazilian talent into our R&D teams and thus enrich the human and cultural diversity of our Group,” said Eric Ducournau, Pierre Fabre Group’s CEO."
"Aurélien Chaufour, ANJAC: “Acquisitions will keep going at the same pace!”","Premium Beauty News - You started gaining strength in the health-beauty sector in 2008, ten years ago. Aurélien Chaufour - Absolutely. That year, we opened a new chapter in our history when we created the Health & Beauty ANJAC division. And within only ten years, we purchased and developed eight complementary innovative companies in the fields of beauty, pharmaceutics, and natural food supplements. Together, they achieve a 200-million-euro turnover and count 1,100 employees across eleven production sites in France. These companies are: – Shadeline, a laboratory specialized in the R&D of dermocosmetics, parapharmaceutical products, and class I and II MDs
– Chemineau, also a laboratory specialized in the development and bespoke production of pharmaceuticals and cosmetic products, as well as medical devices (CDMO)
– Euro Wipes, one of today’s major players on the wipe market, who now offers a whole range of soaked wipes and cotton pads, some of them being class II medical devices
– LPEV, specialized in phytonutrition and micronutrition. They innovate thanks to their expertise in plants
– SICAF, a partner of major luxury cosmetics brands renowned for their know-how in tailor-made formulation, manufacturing, and packaging
– Aircos, an expert in the field of makeup powders, but also a plastic injection specialist, among others
– Lastly, Pascual Cosmétiques, a specialist of cast and liquid shapes for makeup Premium Beauty News - Two of these acquisitions, Aircos and Pascual, helped you gain a foothold in the makeup world! Aurélien Chaufour - Definitely, and we are really delighted! You know Aircos is now shifting into high gear, as they are doubling their production site in Romorantin, France, with an operating surface area of 4,600 m2. With their back injection process, Aircos can really assert their expertise in terms of container/content compatibility. This process highlights all the ingredients’ properties (in particular of pigments and mother-of-pearls) and provides astonishing softness and brightness. As for Pascual Cosmétiques, they are specialized in lipsticks and liquid forms for makeup (foundation, gloss, eyeshadow, nail polish). Created in 2010, the company achieved a six-million-euro turnover in 2017, a result that tripled in three years. As their offering gradually diversified and their R&D activity grew, they were able to provide more and more comprehensive a service offering. In 2017, they purchased a new building in Ferrières-en-Brie, France, to enhance their production: a 5,000 m2 plant next to an R&D laboratory. Premium Beauty News - You have always asserted your passion for industrial business and management. It seems you will not stop here, will you? Aurélien Chaufour - It may sound a bit ridiculous, but it is true! I have a real passion for the industry and the men and women that make it thrive. Development and innovation are real drivers for me. It is also fascinating how we can play with the synergies between these different entities – they are actually great. But, did you say “stop”?! Certainly not. We will keep making progress on all segments, in particular in the cosmetics and dermocosmetics sectors. We are at an advanced stage of negotiations with several other companies. No doubt we will soon make an announcement."
Symrise wants to be a “game changer” of fine perfumery ,"A multi-sensory and multidisciplinary project that combines texts, photography and scents, “A World Tour Through Scent” explores the relations of the peoples around the world with perfume. Presented from 19 to 23 September within the Rives de la Beauté, the project was conceived by Symrise in collaboration with the magazine Nez and photographers of the Tendance Floue group. This scented world tour reveals a global cultural cartography of olfaction. For several months, thirteen Symrise perfumers visited eleven destinations around the world, accompanied by a reporter from Nez and a photographer from the Tendance Floue group to discover global scents and olfactory cultures and illustrate them through words and images. Between creative Odyssey and anthropological expedition, these trips have inspired twelve olfactory scents and eleven photographic white cards analysing the representation of odours and olfactory concepts. This large-scale project invites us to rethink creative processes that open up new perspectives for photography, perfumery and reporting. As part of this opening, Ricardo Omori, Vice-President of the Fine Fragrance Division at Symrise, announced that he is strengthening his Fine Fragrance perfume team with the arrival of three young talents coming directly from the Symrise perfumery school: Leslie Gauthier, Marine Ipert and Suzy Le Helley. Additionally, Mr. Omori announced the arrival of Master Perfumer Annick Ménardo with the Symrise team. A talented scent designer who has marked the contemporary history of perfumery with iconic creations such as Lolita Lempicka, Dior Bois d’Argent, Dior Hypnotic Poison, Boss Bottled, YSL Body Kouros, and Bulgari Black, Annick Ménardo was previously working for Firmenich. Mr. Omori also announced a new exclusive partnership with Payan Bertrand, a producer of raw materials from Grasse, to expand its range of natural ingredients.  Payan Bertrand develops natural materials for perfumes and flavours, a know-how that it will now develop alongside Symrise. A move that illustrates the group’s desire to work with local producers to sublimate and renew its palette of ingredients. These announcements, in the wake of other important news earlier this year, including the launch of several new De Laire bases and of new natural fragrance ingredients, confirm that Symrise intends to challenge the status quo in Fine Perfumery."
Filorga reinvents Le Couvent des Minimes,"Premium Beauty News - What is the brand’s original story? Laure Maluski - Le Couvent des Minimes was created in 2004 by the L’Occitane group with a very similar positioning to the globally renowned brand. Located in Mane, in the Provence region, it capitalized on the origin of the place. It told the history of the nuns that lived there in the 19th century with colognes and beneficial skincare recipes. Purchased in 2017 thanks to the support of the HLD fund by Didier Tabary, President of Laboratoires Filorga, the brand was restructured and its positioning completely rethought. Premium Beauty News - So, you changed everything, except for the name? Laure Maluski - Exactly. As we were looking into the archives, we discovered that an extraordinary man, Louis Feuillée, King Louis XIV’s botanist, had actually lived in the Couvent des Minimes. A real pioneer in this field, he was ordered by the King to travel the world in search of yet unknown botanical species. A historian helped us find his narratives, botanical drawings, and navigation charts, which were amazingly rich. They inspired us in many ways. Based on his adventures, we designed a singular, exploratory, innovative brand combining art with material. Thanks to his botanical explorations, we created a contemporary, bold, green and inspired, luxurious, but affordable High Perfumery concept. Plus, it is 100% vegan, and beautiful both in the form and content. Premium Beauty News - Perfumes are the flagship products of the new range, aren’t they? Laure Maluski - They are, but they are based on a different approach from that of the rest of the market. We believe the future of perfumery should be invented avoiding mainstream standards. So, we thought we should reinvent the codes of luxury perfume by creating a daring French high perfumery – far from standards, but affordable to all. In our Parfums Remarquables collection, we recreated the atmosphere of legendary harbours, from Valparaiso to Santa Cruz, through signed compositions mixing exotic spices, wood, fruit, and flowers with both strength and personality. In Colognes Botaniques, we walked in the Gardens of the Couvent des Minimes to capture their essence and provide intense, long-lasting freshness. Lastly, in the Intérieurs Singuliers collection, we retranscribed the unique atmospheres of different places of the Court of Versailles, which is full of secret stories, and with which Louis Feuillée was familiar. At the head of the olfactory department, we chose a passionate creator, Hervé Gambs, who is supported by a team of 10 French perfumers carefully selected for their ability to change the game. Premium Beauty News - But there are also vegan skincare products… why this decision? Laure Maluski - Indeed, for both our skincare products and the rest of the range, we worked on green formulas, favouring botanical essences and natural materials, and avoiding any controversial ingredient (no sulphates, no parabens, no silicones), while making sure they were all 100% vegan. This philosophy is only natural to us: it is intended for a public willing to combine being with appearance. For us, offering skincare in addition to perfumes was also a way to create a real botanical Art de Vivre and keep paying tribute not only to the skincare recipes of the Couvent, but also to the wonderful plants discovered by Louis Feuillée, the King’s botanist. What was the result? Revisited mythical balms, like the Gardener’s Hand Healer or the Hiker’s Healer, a collection of natural, 100% hypoallergenic skincare products with a lovely name, Amorem, and Soins Remarquables for the body, featuring seven botanical oils inspired from Louis Feuillée’s travels. Premium Beauty News - Are you targeting a new customer profile with this high perfumery positioning? Laure Maluski - Our brand’s rich DNA makes it possible for us to target quite broad a profile: both men and women of all ages in search of non-standardized scents. Search for meaning and real stories, longing to escape, craze for singularity, desire for quality and elegance at an affordable price… I think we do meet all these needs. And I am deeply convinced they are fundamental trends that transcend both age and sex. Premium Beauty News - New concept, new design, new products and new distribution? Laure Maluski - Absolutely. The brand will only be distributed through the selective perfumery channel and department stores. In France, it has been exclusively available at Marionnaud stores since mid-July. Also, we will soon be opening a flagship store in Paris. Premium Beauty News - Do you have ambitions on the global level? Laure Maluski - This year, we are launching our range across Europe and in Japan, and we will keep expanding our global presence in the medium term."
Faber-Castell Cosmetics to open first manufacturing facility in the US,"At a ceremony on the sidelines of the MakeUp in New York tradeshow, Countess Mary von Faber-Castell, President of Faber-Castell Cosmetics, has announced the opening of the company’s first production facility in Elgin, Illinois. “This area is probably the best location for this factory because it is placed near one of the largest logistics hubs globally, the O’Hare airport which is easy to reach from any place in the world via direct flights,” the Countess said. The plant, which is placed at an equal distance to the East Coast and the West Coast markets, will occupy an initial space of 45,000 sq. ft (about 4,180 sqm), with the possibility to extend it to 73,000 sq ft. (about 6,782 sqm), entirely dedicated to the manufacture of the company’s cosmetic solutions. “I am proud to announce this project during the 40th year of Faber-Castell Cosmetics,” added Mary von Faber-Castell. “The U.S. facility will offer U.S. customers the same speed-to-market and convenience now enjoyed by Europe and Brazil.” To provide their North American customers with the same processes, systems and manufacturing standards than in the rest of the world, Faber-Castell Cosmetics has leased a state-of-the-art facility and has planned to invest 9 million dollars in the project. “Adding a North American facility is a remarkable milestone for our company,” said Dr. Christina Zech, Managing Director of Faber-Castell Cosmetics. “The production will start in Q4 with first shipping expected next year. The fast-growth North American market is a priority for us and, as on other key markets, agility and speed to market are key factors of success. It is therefore very important to be located as close as possible from our customers. Thanks to this new plant, we’ll able to produce extremely fast,” she added. As a first step, the company will offer a selection of its range focusing on plastic pencils as wood pencils are not as popular in the US than in Europe or Brazil. At the MakeUp in New York tradeshow, which took place on 12-13 September 2018 at Center 415, on Manhattan’s 5th Avenue, Faber-Castell Cosmetics presented their latest ready-to-market concept Universal Beauty which is targeted to all beauty lovers. To embrace diversity and self-expression, they introduced innovative textures in vivid colours that work for all skin tones. The new line includes, among many other products: Carribbean Breeze, a shimmer highlighter in pencil-shape, or Latin Dance, a cloud coordinated eye make-up duo."

François Luscan - It may sound trite to say so, but our market speeds up the number of launches, the development time, lead times, the emergence of new trends… it all goes faster. For all of us manufacturers, it requires strengthening basics, in particular in terms of operational performance, but also accelerating, simplifying, and making all our processes more efficient when it comes to decision-making, purchase, planning, processing, manufacturing, and innovation. Although we all tend to highlight technologies, in particular digital technologies, which are incredible levers, I am more than ever convinced that it is actually men and women, thanks to their creativity, adaptability, values, and commitment, who will make a real difference and secure their companies’ reputations and the industry’s future. The opportunities of Industry 4.0, the talent war, the importance of training, and environmental protection are all challenges we need to address today. Premium Beauty News - You last expressed your views on Premium Beauty News a little less than two years ago. In the meantime, your group changed shareholders. What are the consequences? François Luscan -  Let’s say a few words about PAI Partners, Albéa’s new partner. It should be emphasized that this company was founded in 1872 and contributed to France’s industrialization in the late 19th century and early 20th. Today,PAI Partners’ industrial investment vision is based on long-term goals and focuses on highly specialized sectors. They clearly assert their desire for growth. With our former partner, Sun Capital, our top priority was industrial optimization through investment to go faster and be more efficient, more modern. As a matter of fact, this period also helped us purchase and integrate seven companies, the latest being metal component manufacturer Covit in February 2018. With PAI, we opened a new chapter in our history: now, we focus on both organic and external growth. Our strategic plan is solid. It was validated with our shareholder and it benefits from our customers’ and teams’ support. Premium Beauty News - In two years, your group has kept investing not only in its industrial tool, but also in acquisitions, to capture new market shares. François Luscan - Generally speaking, it should be reminded that our industrial investments kept reaching about 80 million dollars a year, which helped us innovate, get automated, integrate new production lines to boost our capacity and performance, and acquire new manufacturing processes. As regards acquisitions, I would like to put an emphasis on Covit, the Spanish metal component manufacturer, and on a site specialized in laminated tubes in Levice, Slovakia. You know metal parts are “critical” components for flagship products in our portfolio, like lipsticks and pumps. Covit was one of our strategic suppliers in Europe, and we already had a site in the US and capacities in China. With this acquisition, we contribute to the development of a solid global metal supplier that is recognized on the market. We also develop our expertise together, while preserving independent management techniques. As for the purchase of the Levice site, it strengthened our position on the tube segment in Europe and helped us integrate a new business model combining key accounts and smaller customers with a very entrepreneurial operating mode. It makes it possible to emphasize our vision in terms of acquisitions, but also joint ventures and partnerships. I believe in flexible systems that contribute to developing know-how, combining financial means, and increasing industrial capacities through total or partial integration approaches, for example when it comes to preserving freedom of entrepreneurial action or only purchasing industrial assets. Premium Beauty News - Nowadays, digital technologies, the environment, corporate social responsibility, and full-service offers are more than ever major requisites. How do you adapt? What means do you use to assert your differences? François Luscan - To me, Albéa can be proud of its historic CSR commitment – we started taking action in 2004 and still have the same beliefs today. It is a growth lever that boosts our reputation and attractiveness in the short- and long-term. As a matter of fact, we won the Luxepack in Green award in 2016 for the approach we adopted. But obviously, the context changes quickly. CSR keeps gaining importance to our major customers. International regulations increasingly tackle this issue. It also matters for our “employer brand”, our employees and future recruits, in particular Millennials, who are even more committed than the previous generation. And of course, environmental protection is a major challenge for all States and international associations. At Albéa, our approach is based on four pillars. First, the people. The idea is to guarantee the safety, wellness, and societal compliance of our activities, but also to develop the know-how at the core of packaging trades. The second has to do with our operations and will to reduce our carbon footprint – our energy and water consumption. The third focuses on the products we make. We need to actively contribute to the development of a high-performing circular economy in the field of hygiene-beauty, in relation to the importance of primary packaging and in line with our customers’ commitment. The fourth concerns all our partners: customers, suppliers and associations. Actually, we launched a “Materiality Analysis” among our internal and external stakeholders. This Matrix will help us define a new four-year CSR plan by identifying, prioritizing, and committing to the right stakes for Albéa. As usual, we will ensure we align with our ecosystem and get our teams involved. The results are expected by the end of the year. As for the boom of digital technologies, it is a fact that it changes the way we consume products, communicate, share data, and interact with consumers, brands, and suppliers. Digital technologies make influencers, e-shops, and indie brands emerge and contribute to connected beauty. They also help innovate on more collaborative and cross-disciplinary terms with both agility and speed. Digital technologies contribute to the Industry 4.0 challenges we are addressing. We must adapt to an ever-more complex, volatile, uncertain, and ambiguous world – a world that is getting increasingly more digital and interconnected, and which also keeps speeding up. As far as we are concerned, Industry 4.0 covers 3D prototyping, digital printing, robotics, artificial intelligence, but also open innovation, creativity, human intelligence… Industry 4.0 is based on the development of skills and teams, the acquisition of new talents within a global context of talent war, and the simplification of industrial and administrative processes. There is quite a lot to do! As for the full-service concept, I would like to highlight what was recently pointed out by Xavier Leclerc de Hauteclocque, our Director for our Beauty Solutions activity, which weighs almost 100 million dollars. It guides the market towards turnkey solutions. We have recruited new skills, in particular as regards formulas – not to do our formulators’ job, but to anticipate formula trends and the impacts on packaging, so we can help our customers gain time! We will collaborate with formulators to get their own expertise and offer brands adapted project management. In addition, we will develop our supplier and partner ecosystem, in particular with strong quality and CSR requirements. And of course, we will structure our value proposition to meet the needs of each customer type. We also believe in the value of an ecosystem when it comes to full-service! Premium Beauty News - Will 2018 be a good year for Albéa? What is your forecast for 2019? François Luscan - I have no crystal ball, but the market is growing all over the world, in particular in the selective network, and on almost all segments. Overall, I can say the first quarter 2018 is encouraging and this year should be another positive year, with the 3% or 4% growth rate we aim for. But for this to happen, we must provide our trusting customers with some peace of mind. Our teams are mobilized accordingly. That being said, if you look further ahead, you can see our market changes fast. As far as customers are concerned, there are major groups, but also smaller and smaller brands. They have different needs, especially if you carry out an accurate segmentation. Most of them are growing with very diverse business models. Our challenge consists in supporting the growth of these different markets at the same time, with adapted offerings. Now, as for products, innovation should be faster and more personalized. So, we must implement an agile organization with efficient governance between the local and global levels, between trendy design and disruptive innovation, between the animation of our existing ranges and the novelty arms race, and between standard and specific products: on the market, we are recognized for our process solidity and technical experts’ quality. Premium Beauty News - You talk a lot about the issue of environmental protection. François Luscan - We are all affected by the recent changes in plastics regulations! Of course, Albéa is concerned, but so are our suppliers, our customers and their own consumers. The most visible part of this is the end-of-life of products and plastic packaging, in particular single-use packs. As a matter of fact, mathematically, the consumption of such products increases with urbanization, demographics, the crowds… All sectors are concerned, from supermarket bags to crisp packets, water bottles, detergents… and hygiene-beauty. Basically, the challenge consists in giving up single-use packs and going for recyclable and recycled solutions. It involves the collecting sector and its territorial coverage, the treatment sector (landfilling activities, incineration… and recycling) and its environmental efficiency in the short-, medium-, and long-term, and of course, the regulations on authorized plastic materials for such or such application. Also, the tax system implemented for collecting and waste treatment companies should favour new economic balances. For the cosmetics industry in particular, given the low overall volume and the small size of packs, their image (they are beautiful objects before being plastic packs), and their functionalities (multiple components and materials are often used), today, the main challenge concerns the development of a high-performing circular economy throughout the value chain: how can we set up adapted collection systems? How can we make tax, environmental, but also public health regulations change to support this transition? And how can we manufacturers and suppliers keep integrating eco-design (fewer components, fewer materials, less plastic…), or even circular design to make our packs reusable or recyclable and use recycled (Post-Consumer Recycled) or biosourced raw materials? It is a real challenge for the whole industry, but I strongly believe we will successfully meet it with our customers, suppliers, and competitors. Premium Beauty News - Is it easy today to be a packaging supplier, with all the industrial constraints it involves, in a world where everything is going fast, sometimes “too fast”, and where industrial and technical legitimacy is no longer measured at its fair value? François Luscan - I am fascinated by the cosmetics industry and proud to be a manufacturer in this sector. As a matter of fact, several managers who had started out in the car industry joined us. They tell me that the cosmetics sector goes faster and is more unpredictable and exciting due to the countless challenges we face on a daily basis. To me, the industry is men, sites, territories, a history, and rare skills. It is not a constraint, it is a value – hence the importance of CSR for my group. I am always eager for challenges: today, we must make the industry agile and bank on boldness, creativity, and digital technologies. Premium Beauty News - Your vision has always involved predicting an acceleration of industrial merging. Your group is a leading player in this field. Do you think this will keep going? François Luscan - Yes, there will always be merges. The market has changed a lot, with the notion of time-to-market, digital technologies, the importance of speed and agility, the buzz of turnkey solutions… There are many people coming in, many new business models. Whether small or big, old or new, all players will have to quickly adapt. As far as I am concerned, as I have already said, I strongly believe in partnerships. In our complex world, we need to find win/win opportunities. We must associate in a specific region or in the world, on a segment or a market. Basically, I think any financial operation, whether it be an acquisition, partnership, joint venture, or disposal of assets, is aimed to keep serving our customers better and better. Value compatibility is essential, and so is the quality of our teams. I want to expand my family, not eliminate competitors or launch trying restructuring processes that will slow down my group’s growth. Premium Beauty News - What are the main new launches your group will showcase in the weeks to come, in particular at the Luxe Pack Monaco show? François Luscan - The 2018 Albéa stand will be designed as a pop-up store, where visitors will enjoy a real retail experience: products that can be touched, like in a store, personalized areas, digital features, trends... They will also discover corners adapted to their own brand’s positioning, in particular a green area filled with innovative, environmentally friendly solutions, as well as a formula bar showcasing our turnkey “pack + formula” solutions. Our flagship products will include tubes and foam pumps made of biosourced PE and Post-Consumer Recycled Plastic - some will be competing for the Luxepack In Green Award, and we will highlight multiple new features in our broad range of standard solutions for all brands, applications, and regions – from oval tubes to airless packs, from astonishing decorations to new mascara brushes, masks, and even comprehensive makeup lines…"
Sephora unveils new omni-channel retail concept in China,"The beauty retail giant has lifted the lid on a new retail concept designed to enhance the shopping experience of its Chinese customers.  Dubbed ""My Beauty Power Turn It On"", the new concept takes its name from Sephora’s advertising campaigns in China, where beauty is often perceived as a weapon to successfully achieve one’s own goals. The aim of the project is to increase the number of contact points with Chinese beauty addicts to encourage them to generate their own beauty trends, as well as encouraging them to get creative and share their beauty content online. To that end, Sephora has built a comprehensive omni-channel retail system, which includes 228 physical stores covering 74 cities in China, the official Sephora app, the official website, a Tmall flagship store, a JD flagship store and the recently launched a “mini program” store on WeChat, a system allowing to sell products though the main social network in China. In addition, Sephora will also inaugurate in September its new Asian flagship store, a five-storey building on Nanjing Road in the heart of Shanghai. The company also plans to open twenty new stores each year in China over the next five years. Sephora thus intend to become the first beauty retailer to offer a comprehensive shopping experience, encompassing physical, online and social retail. To publicize the new development, Sephora has snapped up Chinese entertainer Z.TAO, who joins the brand as its new ambassador. The former Exo boy band member has made a name for himself as a solo artist and actor, earning credits in movies such as ""You Are My Sunshine"" and ""The Negotiator."" A choice that certainly owes nothing to chance at a time when young Chinese men are more and more interested in beauty products."
"“Our two major export challenges are Germany and Asia,” Anne Hubel, Natura Siberica","Premium Beauty News - Could you briefly sum up Natura Siberica’s story? Anne Hubel - Natura Siberica was founded in 2007 in Russia by Andrei Trubnikov, a visionary entrepreneur. His idea was to use Russia’s and Siberia’s richness to create an organic beauty brand based on plants from Siberia, this vast area whose preserved ecosystem offers a flora with highly beneficial qualities. Based on this natural wealth, the brand’s founder imagined a varied range of face, hair, and body care products. Andrei Trubnikov wanted this very qualitative line of Ecocert and COSMOS-certified products to be affordable to the general public with an interesting price positioning. Cherry on top, every product is adorned with sophisticated packaging as a nod to his passion for design. Premium Beauty News - How many points of sale are there in Russia today? Anne Hubel - It all started with a wholly-owned store in Saint Petersburg. Today, we count 40 of them across the country, with a presence in all major beauty channels. Premium Beauty News - Can you tell us more about Russia’s biodiversity? Anne Hubel - Siberian plants live under extreme climate conditions. What we call “adaptogenic” plants survived the ice age by adapting to one of the harshest environments on Earth. To resist temperatures of -50 °C, violent winds, and very short growing seasons, they synthesize powerful protective actives and are endowed with antioxidant properties above average. Premium Beauty News - How do you take advantage of this biodiversity? Anne Hubel - Siberia is a vast area comprising four time zones, from the Ural to the Pacific, and from the far north to the southern steppes. We have built four organic farms that each benefit from diverse climates and botanical species. They are all located in regions preserved from any human activity: in Khakassia, on the bank of the Yenisei, in Kamtchatka, along the Pacific Ocean, on the Sakhalin peninsula, and in Kunashir, on the Kuril Islands archipelago. The advantage of an organic farm is that it preserves the natural growth cycles of plants, the optimum harvesting periods, and the fallow times for the soil. When our materials do not come from our farms, but from their surroundings, we choose hand picking, which has been practised for thousands of years according to the rites of local tribes’ ancestors. The harvest should take place when the plant has accumulated the maximum of nutrients and actives. Six hand picking areas were defined, including one in TUVA, in the south of Siberia, on the borders of China and Mongolia. It inspired our new TUVA SIBERICA line, which will be exclusively launched in Monoprix stores in late October 2018. We have an agreement with the local tribes which takes into account sustainable development and preserves their own culture and traditions. Outside Siberia, we have been enriching our ingredient range by turning towards regions whose climate imposes the same harshness as Siberia, like the Highlands in Scotland (thistle harvesting) or the Faroe Islands, off the Danish coast (algae picking). Premium Beauty News - As a matter of fact, you have recently developed a range with the Grasse rose, Sibérie Mon Amour. Anne Hubel - After the brand’s success in France, we wanted to pay tribute to the country with one of its culture’s iconic plants, by combining it with Siberian herbs. We chose Rose de Grasse, in particular for its cosmetics virtues. We used a Grasse rose hydrolate obtained by distillation: it is an ingredient rich in vitamins A, C, and E. It is excellent for the skin’s youth and much concentrated in essential fatty acids. It enhances the synthesis of collagen and ensures efficient protection against free radicals. We mixed it with Siberian plants grown in our organic farms. This mixture of ingredients resulted in an Ecocert-certified range of face and body care products which recently arrived in Parashop and Nocibé stores, in Birchbox boxes, and in a few parapharmacies. Premium Beauty News - Apart from Monoprix, what are your points of sale in France today? Matthieu Sipp - We have set up a pyramid-like distribution system. Our products have been available in Monoprix and Monop’Beauty stores since late 2015, and since the beginning of the year in Nocibé and Parashop stores and beautiful independent pharmacies. Birchbox also offers them. Premium Beauty News - What is your development strategy in France in terms of growth and point-of-sale openings? Matthieu Sipp - We want to find a place in all beauty networks in France, from department stores to supermarkets, from the selective network to pharmacies. The richness of our products helps us offer exclusive ranges adapted to every channel to best meet distributors’ demand and consumer expectations. For example, with Système U, we have designed a range which is gradually settling in the natural brand department of the new U beauty concept. As a result, Natura Siberica customers will be able to find their favourite brand in their different beauty shopping places in France, whenever they want to. Premium Beauty News - Can we talk about your presence in Europe? Matthieu Sipp - We are present in all EU countries. The brand successfully settled in France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, and the UK. We have a nice challenge ahead with Germany, where the brand is gradually finding a place in ‘organic’ networks and drugstores. Our production in Tallinn, Estonia, makes it easier for us to export to Europe and across the world and deal with logistics and the required authorizations. Premium Beauty News - Do you consider developing the brand in other countries? Matthieu Sipp - Apart from Germany, our main challenge remains Asia. The huge success of our brand in France is an advantage, since it can be felt by our global customers. Paradoxically, the craze for our products in France is a guarantee for quality in Russia. It makes Natura Siberica seem more valuable to Russian consumers. That is why we first chose Europe – to make our brand legitimate. So, in the future, we will develop in Asia, in particular in Japan and China. We have exclusive ranges to come, there will be new distributors in France and Europe, and we will also conquer Asia: there is a lot going on for Natura Siberica."
Asquan well under way to its growth target,"Premium Beauty News - It was not that easy to start from ""almost"" scratch? Henri Tinchant - Not that simple you are right, but thanks to both the skills of a team and a clear vision of the current needs and wants of brands in the Beauty sector, the result is the one expected! After two years of work, communication, meetings, explanations, Asquan is a reality. We can be proud of the gone through road. Premium Beauty News - What are your recipes for success? Henri Tinchant - The first of them, a comprehensive service. Like for example, visiting customers with product mock-ups that we present. It doesn’t look like much, even if it is a significant investment for us, but it is fundamental to win customer adhesion! Innovation is on everyone’s lips, but in fact few companies adopt a real R&D approach. Hence, it is important being able to rely on a top level creative team. We have a team consisting of no less than five designers, two of them based on the U.S. West Coast, two in Hong Kong and one in Europe. This creative strategy revolves around biannual presentations (spring-summer and fall-winter). Each year we present a total of 150 new products! The whole of it, supported of course by a strong R&D team. The other plus is our ability to ensure an excellent sourcing while offering the appropriate production capacity in terms of packaging and formulation ranges in all areas. Another important component of the recipe: a recognized, competent and very efficient team. A team of industry professionals, each of them with 10 years of experience in the field of beauty. Because I must stress on the fact that our strategy is based on three pillars: proximity, communication and service. To this end, we have seven people in the United States and a very experienced team of twenty five people in Hong Kong. To note that the Hong-Kong team is a perfect blend of Asian and Western employees (respectively 65 and 35 percent). This allows us to ensure a quality customer service with no less than seven languages spoken. Premium Beauty News - What new areas of development have you been working on? Henri Tinchant - On the commercial front, we decided to increase our scope of action in the skincare area. One person will be specifically dedicated to this market and will be based in the U.S. The second priority: Europe and, in particular, France. Third axis: we have redefined our organization around four divisions (Packaging, Full Service, Brushes and kits). Finally, fourth line of development: meet growing demand concerning environment. We are in the process of initiating a sustainability program, which we are currently developing with the help of a team of young graduates specialized in the field of environment. This program is called the ""3 Rs"" (Refill-Re-use-Recycle). Premium Beauty News - What will you be showcasing at MakeUp in New York? Henri Tinchant - We will premiere our 2019 Autumn-Winter Innovation Program covering our four divisions as well as our new range, ""Frame""."

"Dagmar Chlosta, Schwan Cosmetics: ""We have to rethink our strategy!""","Premium Beauty News - You were appointed Chief Market Officer of the Schwan Cosmetics Group a few months ago. What were your feelings at first concerning this company? Dagmar Chlosta - I worked over the last 20 years for the Adidas Group, where I held various executive positions ranging from operations (including R&D, Materials Management, Innovation, Sourcing, Supply Chain Management) to strategy (including Digitalization) and marketing. In 2015 I moved to the USA and worked for the sporting goods brand Under Armour as SVP Global Operations. A couple of years ago, I wanted to change direction in my career: Working in the cosmetics industry was my lifelong dream, a dream that has finally come true. I found Schwan Cosmetics exciting because of its people and its culture. It is a value-based, traditional and yet international company with a high level of innovation. We are a global market leader and, although we have a low-key presence for end users, we are bursting with ideas and passion. Also, changing perspective and literally sitting at the other side of the table, namely on the supplier vs. the brand side is a great way of expanding my horizons. Here it helps that I was responsible for procurement, product development and range management for two major brands for many years. I know all too well which challenges brands are facing in today’s world. Premium Beauty News - The makeup market has changed considerably in the last three years with the arrival of new brands? Dagmar Chlosta - What was once a brand driven market, is now ruled by the consumer and their expectations are presenting us all with very new challenges. As a consequence, we have to rethink our strategy and how we can service our customers to meet and exceed the desires of this new consumer. We are in the process of changing our organization, we are evaluating our processes and we are laser focused on customer centricity and product leadership. We will offer true end-to-end solutions to our customers – from product to marketing to supply chain. All based on speed to market, agility, individualization and innovation beyond product. We have also onboarded new capabilities in terms of resources. Our strategy and positioning is based on data, experience and total commitment to deliver nothing short of excellence to our customers. Premium Beauty News - Can you give us an update on your digital approach? Dagmar Chlosta - In today’s world it is paramount that we know how to be part of the digital community. Hence, we are consistently enriching our portfolio with new business concepts and ideas from the digital world. It’s all about touch points, about connectivity. We want to be open and learn from digital natives, gather their ideas and see how we can translate these into compelling offers for our customers. The BeautyThon 2018 was another step in this journey. Events like this help us to expand our network in the digital ecosystem. It also allows us to become a network partner for our customers in the digital space. Collaboration, connectivity, innovation, digitalization - these are not just buzz words for us, this is how we define Schwan Cosmetics and our various touch points in our ecosystem. Premium Beauty News - The DNA and the history of your Group are punctuated by innovations in the fields of pencils and formulas. Is it still possible to innovate in this area? Dagmar Chlosta - Of course it is! We have clearly defined our future strategy - we will not create more ‘me too’ products but have identified for ourselves what we believe customers and consumers alike will desire in the future - sustainable innovation. Consumers want it all - high performing product, newness, diversification and a sustainable product that mirrors their beliefs, their lifestyle. This is what we will bring to the market. We are determined, in collaboration with our customers and other partners, to define the future of color cosmetics from a sustainable innovation point of view. You saw a first glimpse at MakeUp in Paris where we launched an industry first with our new product “PERFECT” – the ultimate blend of environmental consciousness in a wooden pen and high performing formula. Stay tuned for more information on this as we are launching our new positioning in the weeks to come: #sustainableinnovation. Premium Beauty News - End consumers have changed dramatically? Dagmar Chlosta - Consumers are now fully connected, they expect instant gratification, they dictate what’s in and what’s out and all at a speed that nobody expected to be possible. They are less interested in brand loyalty and more focused on what a product can do for them. They are connected to their tribe, fully immersed in social media, critical and discerning. As I already stated, what was once a market driven by brands has turned into a completely consumer-driven market. We must be able to respond to this development by working with the brands to satisfy consumer desires. Fortunately, we have a global network of subsidiaries that are close to our customer base. We invest in the future by being in sync with what is happening in the markets and translating this into sustainable innovation. Premium Beauty News - How is your Group addressing the environmental challenge? Dagmar Chlosta - Conscious beauty and sustainability are a worldwide movement. Especially the millennials are a very conscious generation, and as a beauty manufacturer, we have to provide them with products that are in line with their beliefs in a sustainable planet. Therefore, we invest heavily in sustainable innovation also on the packaging side. We are relentlessly researching sustainable materials and are seeing the resurgence of wood through the launch of our PERFECT line. Schwan Cosmetics, with its longstanding history as a key innovator, is now moving into the space of being a “sustainable innovator”."

China’s makeup supplier Beukay Cosmetics sets its sights on international markets,"Shanghai-headquartered manufacturer of colour cosmetics. Beukay has inaugurated its new sales and innovation lab office in Paris.  The ceremony took place at the Bristol hotel in the presence of the company’s main customers and of the founder Gary Cui and CEO Masa Cui.  With a strong expertise in eye products for global multi brands, Beukay intends to increase its customers base in Europe. “I envision Beukay could one day become a globalised great Chinese enterprise,” concluded Gary Cui at the end of the event. Founded in 1997 as a cosmetic distribution company, Beaukay started producing their own cosmetic products and private labels in 2001.  The company opened a brand-new production site in 2005 in Shanghai.  The company started its first international expansion in 2012 with the investment of Korea’s blisters manufacturer Blisspack. In 2014, Beukay opened an R&D centre in Tokyo, Japan and another in Toulouse, France.  In 2018, the company opened a make-up factory in Korea to meet the needs of international prestige brands. Today, Beukay has four R&D centres around the world (Shanghai, Toulouse, Tokyo, Seoul) and three makeup production sites (two in Shanghai and one in Seoul), and six sales offices (Hong Kong, Shanghai, Seoul, Tokyo, Los Angeles and Paris). The company supplies numerous brands which are from global famous Asian and international groups.  However, Beukay wants to grow its global customers base, in particular in Europe and in the USA. “We are committed to continuously tracking current popular trends, existing breakthrough technologies, explore future market and become the market leader in the next 3-5 years. Our approach of innovation is not just to follow, but to use our capabilities and combine them with market and consumer needs. When it comes to the future, we first think of science and technology. Nowadays, women need to fast and simple beauty routines, and persistent textures. We simplify the user’s makeup steps, create new experiences combine with new technologies. As far as innovation is concerned, we’re increasingly using more technologies from other sectors but focusing on relatively mature solutions to give our consumers different pleasant and memorable experiences,” explained Sunny Yang, VP Business Development. This ability to innovate and provide turnkey solutions is a key advantage for the Chinese company, which intends to rely mainly on its factory in Korea to appeal to European brands, even if an acquisition is not excluded."
Chromavis-Fareva is investing over 50 Million euros in Italy in a new building,"It is true that the architectural project of this new plant, which will also be home to the head office of the Company, is surprising to say the least. First of all, with the colour chosen, black! Then through the concept itself of the first buildings that will house the offices and research laboratories, in the form of faceted cubes emerging from the ground, all of them very generously glazed to let light penetrate everywhere. Integrated in the plant a mini workshop entirely dedicated to product industrialization, will enable to speed up processes and ensure maximum efficiency while maintaining flexibility. Finally, the 50,000 m2 site itself settled on a plot of 100,000 m2, will be located in the middle of a lush nature made of gardens and terraces. These new premises will bring together on one site, on the edge of the small town of Offanengo near the city of Crema, all the current offices and factories located in Vaiano Cremasco, Chieve and Crespiatica. ""This is, undoubtedly, the biggest industrial investment in the history of the Fareva Group,"" explained Jean-Pierre Fraisse. ""A project that will become a reality in the coming months and which obviously could not have been possible without the will and financial resources of the Fareva Group"", insisted Fabrizio Buscaini. Fareva and beauty, a constant strategy... In just ten years, the Fareva Group (1.65 billion euros in sales, 12,000 employees, 39 plants) will have come a long way in this beauty segment. In August 2013, the Group announced the acquisition of the Italian manufacturer Chromavis, and then finalized in July 2014 the integration within Chromavis of its Farevacolor division. ""This integration is part of a coherent process in creating new products and new production systems that will benefit to the cosmetic industry by providing Chromavis (130 million euros in sales), with a new potential strength,"" the Group explained in a statement. Chromavis thus became the dedicated make-up centre of the Fareva Group and could benefit from new production platforms, such as Cosmeva (France) and Fareva Richmond (VA, USA). At the same time, the Fareva Group also recovered the nail polish activity of Chromavis and its factory in Brazil. Just a year ago, in July 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance announced the sale of its cosmetics manufacturing wing to Fareva. Under the terms of the agreement, Fareva was taking ownership of BCM.  Simultaneously, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Fareva made a agreement for a 10-year global partnership for the manufacture and supply of Walgreens Boots Alliance own beauty brands and private label products, including products for sale in the USA. BCM operates factories in Nottingham in the UK, Vitré in France and Frankfurt in Germany. In 2017, the turnover of Chromavis reached EUR 150 million and the target for 2018 is of 185 million, for a total workforce of 880 employees. The Group owns five R&D centers and serves some 300 customers in 34 countries. ""Being part of the Fareva Group,"" insisted Fabrizio Buscaini, ""guarantees a strong financial, industrial and strategic backup with industrial sites all over the world: United States, Brazil, Poland, Ukraine, France and Germany. Our goal is clearly to double our turnover in the medium term. We are the second manufacturer in the sector today in Italy; we want to be the first! To reach this goal we need vision, passion, determination and pride. Everything is moving very fast in the beauty sphere. We can develop new products in less than three months. We have become a real laboratory of ideas where we anticipate makeup products of tomorrow. This new site of Offanengo will be a genuine platform dedicated to innovation and creativity""."
Biologique Recherche to take profit of the dynamic Brazilian high-end market,"The Biologique Recherche family company, created by Physician Philippe Alouche and specialized in skin treatments for 40 years, has long been developing its expertise in sophisticated face, body, and hair care based on products highly concentrated in actives and a three-phase method. The brand initiated its revival in Brazil two years ago, under the leadership of Thierry Mabboux (MVL), who took responsibility for its distribution, targeting high-standard hotel spas first, and then also dermatologists, as well as high-end hairdressing and beauty salons. “We are already working with ten partners, and about twenty projects are under way in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and in the south of the country,” announces Thierry Mabboux. “Luxury is a prominent sector in Brazil, just like a few segments like hair care. Biologique Recherche is very well-positioned in these fields,” he adds. As a matter of fact, the brand has developed a post-beach hair care protocol containing at least 20% actives, like all products in the range. This expansion meets the expectations of a specific consumer category. The professional believes it is also due to the market transformation related to the development of the Internet. “Today, women are connected. They are better-informed of what occurs in the sector and of the product offering in other countries. They want the same thing. It also breaks down many access barriers in such a large country,” he explains."

Juliette has a Gun chooses Paperscent for dispensing scented blotters in their first shop in Paris,"Launched in 2006 by the perfumer Romano Ricci, the great-grandson of Nina Ricci, niche perfume brand Juliette has a Gun recently opened the doors of its first standalone shop, designed as place where coffee and perfume meet.  Dubbed Café Juliette, the new shop offers a convivial place where women can spend a pleasant moment, not only to test a perfume but also to taste coffee or drink champagne. ""The idea behind Café Juliette is to go beyond the simple perfume shop in order to offer a friendly place dedicated to women and to perfumes. Women will not hesitate to drop in unexpectedly, or by a flash, to perfume themselves, to have a quick makeover, to drink a glass of champagne, a Mariages Frères tea or a Coutume café, offered by the brand,” explains Romano Ricci, creator of Juliette has a Gun. Within the shop, women will not only be able to discover the 13 Juliette has a Gun perfumes, including Moscow Mule, Lady Vengeance, and Not a Perfume, as well as the scents of the brand’s Luxury Collection, but also to attend a Barista workshop, in partnership with Coutume Café. The shop’s setting mixes modern merchandising and an intimate vibe where a waitress-perfumista welcome customers behind a bar. To help consumers to test their perfumes, Juliette has a Gun has chosen Paperscent, an innovative system that dispenses scented cards on-demand. The user-friendly device is integrated into the shop’s interior design: consumers just have to pull on a strip of paper to instantly get a scented card. The system, developed by Gaudier Kuppel, a French merchandising specialist, has the advantage to save perfume, compared to a standard sampler, and to avoid air saturation. Thanks to Paperscent’s user friendly and automatic operation, Juliette has a Gun was able to place one of the devices in the facade of Café Juliette with the aim to offer passer-by the opportunity to discover the brand’s perfumes 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. Day and night, people walking in front of the store can leave with a scented card designed as a business card: with the name of the brand, the mail and address of the store. Integrated behind a slate, the device offers a real olfactory communication space for the perfumes that the shop wants to put under the spotlights. Juliette Coffee

Faber-Castell Cosmetics celebrates 40 years and announce new international development plans,"Forty years after its creation, Faber-Castell’s cosmetics division now represents 20% of the group’s total turnover [1]. Now chaired by Countess Mary von Faber-Castell, the wife of Count Anton-Wolfgang von Faber-Castell, who passed away two years ago, the Faber-Castell Cosmetics division relies on three production sites - two sites in Germany (in Stein and Geroldsgruen), and a site in Brazil (in Sao Carlos, near Sao Paulo) - as well as on a global network of sales offices in 14 different countries. Taking example on the Faber-Castell group, whose origins date back to 1761 and the creation of a wood-cased pencils factory by the cabinetmaker Kaspar Faber, the cosmetics division has been innovating continuously. “In the last 2 years, we developed two new packaging options: The sharpenable slim plastic pencil MAGNETIC is the perfect packaging for super long-lasting formulations and can easily be customized from ‘tip to toe’. And STYLER - our second slim liquid liner generation - is available with four different felt tips and provides an incredibly stunning, deep, saturated ink flow in one stroke whether you prefer an eyeliner in deep, dense black or icy metallic,” said Mary von Faber-Castell. At the MakeUp in Paris trade show, held on June 21 -22, Faber-Castell Cosmetics celebrated its 40th birthday with the launched of the Countess’ Classics box, a set of five pencils featuring a lipstick, a lip liner, an eye shadow, an eyeliner and an eyebrow pencil, selected by the Countess herself.  The company also took advantage of the show to highlight its latest market-ready concepts: long-lasting kohl eyeliners; metallic pigments that amaze with an extra sparkle when blended; and velvety-matte lip colours that make lips feel moisturized and comfortable; fluid-like formulations in pencil-shape to softly beautify and retouch the skin. After having built a state-of-the-art production plant producing wood-cased and mechanical pencils for the international markets as well as liquid products for the Latin American region, Faber-Castell Cosmetics seeks to further expand its international presence to better address its customers’ requests for increased flexibility and responsiveness. “Future not only means product and process development for us. We are also working on diversifying and internationalizing our organization. Lean and flexible structures are a must in the ever changing environment of the global cosmetics landscape as well as proximity to Markets, customers, consumers and their needs and trends,” said Christina Zech, Managing Director at Faber-Castell Cosmetics. Asked by Premium Beauty News about the possible opening of a production site in North America, Mary von Faber-Castell said that the company is ""very close to make an announcement with this respect.”  Stay tuned!"
Brittany - a region at the helm of France’s marine cosmetics industry,"The region is home to a 2,730km coastline and many companies have tapped into the research and innovation opportunities presented by its ecosystem. Brittany’s cosmetics industry generates EUR 1.8 billion in sales and provides some 6,000 jobs, according to figures from a study carried out by technology transfer centre CBB Capbiotek. However, the cosmetics giant Yves Rocher, which is firmly established in the region and produces 85% of its cosmetics here, accounts for the lion’s share of sales and jobs. Excluding Yves Rocher, Brittany’s cosmetics industry generates EUR 400 million in sales and provides work for some 2,600-2,700 people, the study found. 167 Breton groups operate in the cosmetics industry, about half of which record more than 50% of their sales in cosmetics. Of these, half again work in finished products; a quarter in ingredients and raw materials; and another quarter in service, tests, formulation and packaging, the study identified. Of the 167 companies, 61% export internationally, principally to Europe, North America and Asia. The average export rate within these companies is 40%. Brittany is home to some 700 species of seaweed. 30% of the companies work in marine cosmetics, half of which are based in Finistère. These businesses account for total sales of EUR 150 million and around 730 jobs. The region boasts three marine biology stations (Concarneau, Dinard and Roscoff) and close to 40 innovation centres and platforms. The Station Biologique de Roscoff is involved in the GENIALG project which aims to promote marine cultures and their use in the cosmetics field. This centre also recently teamed up with researchers from the Biologie Intégrative des Modèles Marins and the Laboratoire des Sciences de l’Environnement Marin to conduct research on brown algae. The result of the study was a patent which claims to aid the production of phlorotannins (a type of tannins found in brown algae), which are used as natural extracts by the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries. Besides Yves Rocher, Brittany is also home to several key players in the cosmetic field, which has seen particularly strong growth over the last 20 years or so. Based in Dirinon and Relecq-Kerhuon, Technature specializes in the treatment of alginate and is a global leader in the production of masks.  The company generates sales of EUR 20 million, 50% of which comes from outside France. R&D represents 10% of its workforce. Laboratoires Gilbert makes gels, creams oils and balms for its Algotherm range; as well as aromatherapy products, liquid soaps and oleo limestone baby milk for its Laboratories Gilbert arm. The group’s Plouédern production unit is specialized in the biotechnological exploitation of algae and in marine cosmetics and employs 100 people. Lessonia, which was founded in 2002, works with global cosmetics brands such as L’Oréal, for whom it has developed a new shampoo composed of flower petals.  Lessonia is present in 75 countries. Agrimer - Bretagne Cosmétique Marins is a key player in the algae sector, in which it claims to be the only firm to cover the entire production chain (from the collection of algae to the finished product). 75% of its sales come from export. According to the group’s president André Prigent, Agrimer has the capacity to produce 10,000 tonnes of algae per year. As well as the market leader Yves Rocher and the more established brands, there is also space for smaller companies to break into the market. 50% of the firms in the region employ less than ten people (a figure which is closer to 60% in Finistère). These companies generate on average some EUR 650,000 in revenues. They invest on average 14 to 15% of their sales in R&D. One such small company is Plouineau-based Formaderm, which was founded in 2002 and deals in phytotherapy (gels with plant-based extracts) and aromatherapy (essential oils). It employs ten people and generates EUR 850,000 in revenues. Quimper based Yslab, which was founded in 2000 and has 13 employees, offers finished products based on marine biotechnology. Among its offering is a toothpaste made with algae extract. Yslab is present in Russia, China, the Middle East and Europe. 90% of its revenues comes from export. “The marine cosmetics sector has truly evolved,” comments André Prigent, President of Agrimer-Bretagne Cosmétiques Marins. “Twenty years ago, not many people were interested in cosmetic biotechnology. Today it’s become central. At the last in-cosmetics trade show it was one of the areas at the heart of the innovations,” adds Roland Conanec of CBB Capbiotek. With a combination of small and medium-sized companies anchoring themselves on Brittany’s marine cosmetic map, it seems clear that this landscape is no longer just about Yves Rocher."
"“Brazilian consumers are a strategic source of inspiration for L’Oréal,” Delphine Allard, L’Oréal Brasil","Premium Beauty News - How is this innovation centre positioned within the L’Oréal Group? Delphine Allard - It is part of the global network of L’Oréal innovation centres across the world, which comprises five other hubs in Japan, China, India, the United States, and South Africa. They all work hand in hand with our research centres in France. Last year, we inaugurated a new generation building on the Bom Jesus island close to Rio, but the R&I activity already existed in Brazil since 2009, on four different sites. The new site helped us gather all our teams and gain efficiency. Premium Beauty News - What is this investment aimed to? Delphine Allard - Brazil is the world’s 4th beauty market, so it has a strategic importance. But if the L’Oréal group chose to invest that much, it is also due to the diversity you can find there. Brazil is the only country where you can easily find the eight hair types in our classification, from the straightest to the curliest. In addition, out of the 66 skin tones in the classification system set up by L’Oréal, 55 can be found in Brazil. It is a very important source of inspiration for us. Meeting the needs of this great diversity is almost like meeting the needs of the whole world’s diversity. Also, beauty is important for Brazilian women. They are among the most demanding and expert women in the world. It was crucial for us to get as close as possible to this strategic source of inspiration, in order to understand their routines and meet their needs. In this centre, we have the installations and equipment to welcome and understand them. Premium Beauty News - Does L’Oréal Brasil Research have any specificities? Delphine Allard - The main mission of our R&I centre is to develop products based on local consumers’ needs, but with a global potential. Due to climate conditions, aggressive treatments, and specific hair types, Brazilian women use five hair care products a day on average as part of their routines, compared to three on average for American or European women. Therefore, hair care is definitely the top priority category on which we have been focusing the most. Last year, we launched our first leave-on treatment adapted to Brazilian women’s damaged hair: Elsève Cicatri Renov. Then, this product conquered the American market, and more recently Europe, where it is available under the name Cica Crème. It is a perfect example of an innovation developed in Brazil, but with a global potential. Premium Beauty News - Have you been working on other categories? Delphine Allard - Our second flagship category is sun care, in particular face sunscreens. The high UV indices and the humid climate in Brazil lead us to meet very specific needs, i.e. a very high, long-lasting protection and a mattifying skin feel, the ‘toque seco’ effect for oily skins. Our laboratory was able to meet these needs, in particular by drawing inspiration from a technology initially intended for skincare and developed by the international L’Oréal Research network. This AIRlicium technology is endowed with an extremely strong humidity and sebum absorption power. Based on this innovation, we launched a specific range, Anthelios AIRlicium by La Roche-Posay, with a very high protection up to an SPF70. Women here can use a sun protection factor of 70 on a daily basis: so it sets even higher standards in terms of product sensoriality and long wear. Initially launched with white and tinted versions, the Anthelios AIRlicium range got wider this year, with three new shades to meet the diversity of skin colours in the whole country. Today, this range helps us remain leaders in the category of tinted sun care, which shows a high growth rate and represents 45% of the sun care market. Due to its specificities, this product is only dedicated to the Brazilian market for now, but we have been evaluating its potential and working on a better-adapted version on the global level. Premium Beauty News - To what extent is this L’Oréal Brasil R&I centre a model of the genre within the L’Oréal network? Delphine Allard - Our installations are definitely up-to-date, with a unique Flex laboratory within the L’Oréal Group. It is not segmented according to categories, but to activities (weighing, control, manufacturing…). Beyond the advantage of improving flows and capitalizing on the equipment, it helps us favour cross fertilization between the various categories. A technician can be developing a hair treatment formula next to someone working on sun care and exchange about textures, protocols… It generates ideas and it is a more efficient collaborative and creative workspace. That is why we are unique and are becoming a model for other centres. Also, we have an exemplary assessment area, with all the installations needed to work, again, as close as possible to consumers, whether it be for the design, with co-creations, or for product assessment, from the prototype phase to the final validation. This co-creation concept is very interesting: for example, last year, we were able to launch a special range for curly hair designed with Brazilian consumers for local brand Niely. These women were consulted right from the beginning of the project until the final name choice. Premium Beauty News - Is the outstanding potential of Brazilian diversity an additional form of inspiration for L’Oréal Research? Delphine Allard - Apart from product development, we have an Advanced Research team whose main role is to discover, work, and put forward the ingredients derived from the Brazilian biodiversity on the global level. In Brazil, we are lucky enough to have access to inspiring ingredients with unique performances. To this aim, we work with local suppliers or directly in partnership with local communities as part of our Sharing Beauty With All programme. It has already resulted in a number of projects on ingredients identified as inspiring and highly efficient, like kamu kamu for Vichy, murumuru, cupuaçu, and pracaxi. Premium Beauty News - Do Brazilian women prefer cosmetics containing Brazilian ingredients? Delphine Allard - What matters to them are natural ingredients in general. The naturalness trend is important to many of them. However, they never compromise on performance for the sake of naturalness."
Alkos aims for industrial excellence with freshly inaugurated plant in France,"Premium Beauty News - You have just achieved a major project! Philippe Pavageau - Indeed! The challenge was to reposition Inter Cosmétiques as a major and unavoidable industrial player in the sector of personal care and make-up contract manufacturing, by providing the Company with an industrial tool that would allow producing in optimum conditions the innovative formulas devised by our Marketing teams and developed by our R&D teams. Led by Franck Dechatre, the site Director, the complete project spanned over two years (2016/2017). The logistics activity moved first in December 2017 and the complete transfer of our two sites in Angers (UP1 and UP2) to the new facility was completed by the end of March 2018. The new site has a bigger manufacturing capacity (1,400 m²) and a very large surface area dedicated to the packaging workshop (3,000 m²). Brand new equipment was also installed, including a new Atex 6 ton-tank for the cold processing of liquids, a next-generation lipstick filling machine equipped with metal and silicone pans with automatic feeding (labelling, mechanical nominal output of 60 pcs / min on average). These new investments enable Inter Cosmétiques to increase its production and manufacturing capacity by about 40%. This also allowed the Group to have a manufacturing workshop with the highest international standards, to gain competitiveness and consolidate the quality of the service offered to customers. Premium Beauty News - An awesome result that helps to see the future with optimism? Philippe Pavageau - We are of course, like our staff, whose working conditions have improved considerably, very satisfied with the result and I want to take this opportunity to once again thank Franck and his teams for the tremendous work accomplished in ensuring the continuity of operations including during the transfer of activities from the former site to the new one. However, a modern industrial site is not a sufficient condition for achieving the industrial excellence we are targeting, but it is a necessary condition, which we fulfil today. Our task is not completed and we are now tackling the huge challenge of industrial excellence. It is important to underline that we are also committed to a very active corporate social responsibility policy, which is part of our values and meets the expectations of all our key accounts. As such, we are proud to have recently been granted the Ecovadis Gold certification for the Inter Cosmétiques and Alkos sites. We are forging on with our existential goal: the satisfaction of our clients, because it is with their trust and their new projects that we can progress and support their development. Our investment programme in terms of industrial tools will provide us with the necessary levers to carry out this mission. A new milestone in the development of the Alkos Group The Company has gone a long way since December 1986 when Jean Pierre Sandrin created the Laboratoires Inter Cosmétiques and started operating in the suburbs of Angers, in the West of France. At the time, lipstick was manually or semi-manually poured into 40-cavity metal moulds. The bulk was heated in vessels or in a saucepan, the temperature of moulds was controlled by simply passing the hand over them, then the bulk was cooled in the fridge and after the required time, moulds were opened and one by one the grapes were hand-picked and placed in the mechanisms. After having extended its activity to filling and manual decoration, in the early 1990s Mr Sandrin pioneered the development of the first airless filling machine in cooperation with the Valois Company, a major innovation which attracted new customers. Because of this success, the historical site became too small and the Company had to move in October 1992 in the UP1 factory, at 8 rue de la Claie with a staff of about 80 people; a location where the company will stay for 25 years until the end of 2017. In the meantime, with the development of activities a second site in Beaucouzé, called UP2 opened in July 1999 in parallel with the acquisition of SAGAL to the Guerlain/Dior/Chanel EIG (Economic Interest Grouping), a Company based near Chartres, specialized in the manufacture of high end soaps and scented deodorants. The activity will continue to flourish in the 1990s with the outsourcing of logistics and storage operations to an operator in the neighbouring industrial zone In 2008, Gérard Gieux bought the Inter Cosmetiques and SAGAL companies to create the Alkos Group, which was then gathering Cosmogen, a supplier of cosmetic accessories and packaging, and Alkos Cosmétiques, a French-based manufacturer of cosmetic pencils. After the severe economic crisis in the late 2000s, and under the leadership of Dominique Vautier, its President, the activity took a new boost with the arrival of Florence Lefeuvre to head the Sales and Marketing. An industrial master plan will quickly demonstrate, early 2014, that the two UP1 and UP2 sites would no longer be able to sustain the expected growth. Several options were therefore considered: - An expansion on the existing UP1 site.
– The transfer of the make-up activity on the site of Alkos Cosmétiques in Boulogne sur Mer.
– The construction of a new site or the rehabilitation of an existing industrial site available for sale. Two sites were available in the suburbs of Angers and the one previously occupied by Valéo was eventually selected. The new plant project was definitively adopted in September 2015, with the financial support of local administrations."
"“It is critical to take into account the complete change in consumer habits over the past few years,” Jean François Harpes, IL Cosmetics","It’s no secret that the nail polish sector has been experiencing a global decline over the past four years. In such a context, leveraging consumer insight and market analysis to understand the expectations of end users and to tailor product development is a key axis of Luxembourg-based group IL Cosmetics’ strategy. The group recently commissioned a market research company to conduct a study on its most important European markets; namely Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy, across the nail polish and nail cosmetics spectrum. The aim was to find out “why the nail polish market, which used to be around 6 billion units, has dropped to under three,” Harpes explains. “We believe it’s absolutely critical to take into account the complete change in consumer habits over the past few years.” Users are moving beyond traditional nail polish, and semi-permanent is one area that is seeing significant growth. “Semi-permanent, which about four years ago had a market share in the U.S. and Europe of about five to ten percent, gained very large market shares,” Harpes explains. ""It is between 25 and 40 percent depending on the market, and has an even stronger penetration rate of about 40 percent in some markets such as Ukraine and Russia.” With more nail polish users looking to semi-permanent formulas, this sub-segment is predicted to grow further still in the future. Natural formulas are a small but growing trend. While consumers are looking for eco-friendly formulas, the market has been slow to respond to consumer demand, mainly due to technical constraints. “It is big in the idea but small in the sales, except in China where alternative water-based formulas account already for at least 1/3 of the market,” Harpes says. “This is because brands haven’t found suitable formulas that pushed them to move away from normal nail polish.” While such formulas don’t necessarily have to be water-based, says Harpes, they need to be more natural, safer and chemical free. Hybrid formulas, which currently only claim a three to five percent market share, could have a real future, says Harpes, provided that the category brings something more than what is already on the market. “Hybrid will have a future if it is really a category in between [conventional] nail polish and semi-permanent,” he states. He explains: “That means, if you can apply with the brush, if it dries reasonably fast, if the performance is better than nail polish, if it’s long-lasting and if you can remove it easily.” Harpes claims that, with nothing on the market that currently fits this bill, hybrid polishes are ripe for innovation. IL Cosmetics seems well-positioned to tackle the tough market, having made significant investments since the second quarter of 2017 to allow it to offer products across the entire nail cosmetics spectrum: conventional nail polishes and alternative formulas (water-based, odour-free, naturally sourced ingredient formulas), as well as hybrid and semi-permanent. The company now has independent teams working across the different segments (more than 20% of its employees work in R&D and innovation), which enables multiple, parallel product innovations - said to be key to the group’s flexibility. In the middle of last year, for example, IL Cosmetics began looking to the growing segment of soak-off gel polish, and will present its formulations in this area at the upcoming MakeUp in Paris trade show, which will take place on 21 and 22 June at the Carrousel du Louvre in the French capital. While conventional nail polish remains the group’s core business, Harpes says that understanding the technicalities of the semi-permanent category will help guide further developments in the intermediate hybrid category. Given the difficult market, IL Cosmetics is not one to rest on its laurels. The group says it continually strives to outsmart its own developments by improving and updating formulas, with all of its new launches validated upstream by consumer panels. Beyond the nail category, the company is also looking to develop by entering new categories through its lips and eye makeup division Luxcos. Luxcos currently manufactures mascaras, liquid eyeliners and lip glosses. “We’re looking to other lip products and we’re looking to foundations… this is probably still six months to a year ahead,” reveals Harpes. “We believe that the basis for this diversification is setting up the internal structures which allow us to be active in many new segments. All these diversification plans are supported and will be followed by a reinforcement of the marketing teams.” To this end, an acquisition could be on the cards. “As well as internal growth, we are also still looking into possibilities of external growth,” said Harpes, adding that this is likely to be for other makeup products in the lip area, or perhaps foundations. Watch this space."
Fiabila enters the Brazilian nail polish market,"The opening of this new, twelfth production site just shows how strong the Brazilian market’s potential is. Considered as the first global market in volume for nail polish, Brazil boasts exponential dynamics. “Brazil should soon be ranked first in value, as the nail polish unit price is very low there,” declares Pierre Miasnik, the group’s President. This future situation goes with consumers’ search for more qualitative products. “The market is not mature in terms of offering and marketing, so there is a strong potential for a restructured, more qualitative, diversified, and technical offering,” adds General Manager Alexandre Miasnik. As the only one global producer in this field to have a production unit in Brazil, Fiabila appears as a choice partner for major Brazilian players and global cosmetics brands as they enter a market devoid of any tailor-made packaging expert in nail polish. In addition, this opportunity helps the manufacturer highlight his unique know-how and technologies. The latest change in Sun Prodigy showcased at Cosmoprof 2018 perfectly exemplifies this. A pioneer in hybrid formulas, Fiabila has been working for several years on improving their performances to reach levels close to permanent nail polish gels, only without the drawbacks. The Sun Prodigy patented solution is derived from this technology. Based on the development of an innovative oligomer, the formula polymerizes in the presence of natural UV rays, those of the day light, for a long wear, shiny result that can last over seven days. It is a three-step application: the base for the adhesion, the coloured layer, and the overlayer sensitive to the sun rays. Each of these three specific products can also be used separately. “The Brazilian market is very specific. Women often go to beauty salons, where the application is definitely affordable, but home routines are increasingly popular. In addition, they are not turned to semi-permanent polish at all, whereas customer expectations tend to be focused on long wear and shininess, as well as quality, to prevent any allergic reactions, which are frequent with local products. So, our solution has it all to convince them,” comments Alexandre Miasnik. The new production site spreads across 15,000 m2, including 8,000 m2 of buildings, for a manufacturing capacity of 20 tonnes of base per day and eight filling and packaging lines, three of which are already working. Two additional ones will be operational this summer, and three others are scheduled in the short term. The plant comprises an R&D laboratory to control raw materials and finished products and offers customers very high-level service and flexibility. “Fiabila can supply all market segments, whatever the price positioning, but always with a better quality offering. The price range is very large here, it can range from 3 to more than 20 Reais, and the formulas are not always that safe,” explains Alexandre Miasnik. “Our offering is also much diversified for players whose demand can range from simple colourless bases to turnkey finished products. Our flexibility is an advantage,” he adds. At the end of their first year of activity, the two Directors draw positive conclusions from the significant investments made. “We are already working with high-profile players in Brazil, and more widely across Latin America. The globalization of local brands plays a positive role: we can provide them with a qualified product which can be distributed all around the world without any risks,” asserts the group’s President."
Beauty full service: Marvinpac acquires a stake in the capital of Strand Cosmetics Europe,"Premium Beauty News - Marvinpac and Strand Cosmetics Europe already know each other well?! Éric Bouvier - Indeed, Strand Cosmetics and Marvinpac have been working together for more than three years as part of MS Swiss Cosmetics, a joint venture dedicated to the development, manufacturing and packaging of Swiss made skincare and make-up products. We realized very quickly that other synergies were possible, beyond the ""Made in Switzerland"", especially through the use of the Marvinpac site in the Czech Republic. This collaboration has already enabled us to win new interesting tenders. In addition, building on these early successes, we started to give wider consideration to an even closer partnership and laid out hard data. We defined a strategic plan, with, as a first step, Marvinpac taking a minority but yet significant stake in Strand Cosmetics Europe. Ludovic Hericher - Beyond the strategic aspects, there is also a human adventure behind this. As soon as we started working together on the MS Swiss Cosmetics project the contribution from our teams, was already very strong, which encouraged us to go one step further. Premium Beauty News - What are the objectives of this merger? Éric Bouvier - This will allow us to significantly broaden our offer. Depending on our customers’ needs, we will be able to offer made in France, made in Switzerland, or European products. Ludovic Hericher - Brands that trust us can now rely on three industrial tools complying with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) standards, some of which are specific to the production of OTC products. This will help us better meet the growing expectations of brands in terms of production capacity, responsiveness and competitiveness. Bulk is always produced in France or Switzerland to respect the designation of origin dear to our customers. Some filling operations can also be carried out in the Czech Republic to offer our customers very competitive costs. Through our three sites, we can therefore guarantee a continuity of production (Business continuity plan or BCP), an increasingly important parameter for brands. Premium Beauty News - With some investments on top of it? Éric Bouvier - Of course! Mainly in order to further strengthen our production capacities, in both Switzerland and France. At Strand Cosmetics Europe’s site, near Lyon, where many things have already been done, we will continue to increase our bulk production and filling capacity. Ludovic Hericher - New investments are also planned in Switzerland and we will boost our production capacity in the Czech Republic where are performed filling operations for jars, vials, BB cream-type compacts, and tubes in a certified high hygiene environment audited by leading brands. Several million pieces are already filled and conditioned. The aim is to further strengthen these capacities and expand further our portfolios with new product lines. Premium Beauty News - Will this merger lead to a specialization of your production sites? Ludovic Hericher - This is not on the agenda, but we will continue to work to strengthen synergies where they really make sense. The MS Swiss Cosmetics experience has demonstrated that with an efficient staff, we are already capable of achieving substantial revenues and are ready to record a fine growth with the premium brands trusting us. We rely on the infrastructure of our respective companies, particularly in terms of R & D, regulatory affairs, marketing and sales, industrialization and supply chain. Today, to support brands in their new needs, agility in a fast track mode is required to be ready willing and able to respond to their important growth driven needs. For this, working in close connection with our customers and a rigorous follow-up are the key. It is therefore important that each of our entities remain relatively autonomous while benefiting from the Group’s synergies. Éric Bouvier - Let us also specify that all entities will keep their own identity. Premium Beauty News - There is a growing concentration of players in the cosmetics subcontracting area. The accelerating of pace of launches and the increasing demands of brands on their distributors seem to generate increasing pressure? Éric Bouvier - Undeniably pressure is increasing in terms of prices and deadlines. We must support the growth of brands by offering as much flexibility as possible. The supply chain becomes a strategic element of the offer and this calls for significant resources requirements, both human and industrial. We just hired a Supply Chain Director coming from a large group in the medical device industry. Ludovic Hericher - Full service has always been part of Marvinpac’s DNA. At a time when demand from brands is becoming stronger and more complex, the rapprochement with Strand Cosmetics Europe is the guarantee to offer our customers a one-stop window offering R & D, bulk manufacturing, filling operations and even the preparation of shipments, not to mention regulatory issues. We can also offer our specific knowledge for co-packing, the manufacturing of assembled boxes and kitting in our site in the Czech Republic. In short, as you can see, we are more than ever in working order! PremiumBeautynews - What are the next steps? Éric Bouvier, Ludovic Hericher -  We are launching a series of meetings bringing together our teams to build a joint marketing and sales strategy in cosmetics, with offers that integrate the specificity, expertise and identity of our sites."
"“Cosmetica Italia should be recognized as the national reference entity in the cosmetics industry”, Renato Ancorotti","Premium Beauty News - You are succeeding Fabio Rossello, who has worked a lot on promoting the Italian perfume & cosmetics industry since 2011. How important is this industry today? Renato Ancorotti - In 2017, the Italian cosmetics industry achieved a total turnover of 11 billion euros (+4.3%), even 15.7 billion euros if you count the whole chain, from the ingredients to the finished products, including the machines and the packaging. Export remains one of the key growth drivers of this branch in Italy, since, for the same year 2017, it rose by 8%, compared to the previous year, reaching 4.7 billion euros. Premium Beauty News - What are your programme’s top priorities? Renato Ancorotti – First, my mission will obviously be to do everything I can to make sure this sector develops according to ethical and responsible values. I will do everything needed to offer as many internal services as possible for our members. I consider my mission as a means to promote the values of the industry abroad and to protect the interests of our branch. The only vision needed for the Association is, above all, to be the only reference point for all cosmetics companies. I have planned to quickly organize a large meeting to redefine our strategic priorities and better understand how we should govern the association. In addition, I intend to appoint what I call a “coordinator”, who will be in charge of regularly visiting members in their premises, so that they are better-informed about the services the association can offer them. He/she will listen to their ideas and needs, which will then be shared and evaluated. Actually, I think the presence of a Board member that belongs to the same group as the company visited would contribute to strengthening the relationships between the Association and its members. Premium Beauty News - What are your views on governance? Renato Ancorotti - I think it is important to reinforce the role of our Board of Directors, by creating more operational positions. It will be essential to collaborate with the other organizations representative of the industry and with key people, as well as with the authorities, for example as regards training. We need to be able to share more about our industrial and commercial experiences. We will need to organize more meetings with each other. To me, it is important to make the association more flexible, to build a real structured network with the participation of new entrepreneurs guided by some of our own members who would act as “tutors”. And of course, all this should be done with perfect loyalty. Premium Beauty News - Will there be working groups? Renato Ancorotti - Of course there will be! They are very important. It is crucial to set up an accurate programme, and probably to increase these groups’ budgets. Each of them will need to be representative of the member sectors. Of course, we also need to invest in environmental protection, and we should not forget about better representing major companies. Premium Beauty News - Is the global level a priority for you? Renato Ancorotti - It is essential! We will most likely need to be more present in exhibitions and fairs. We will also need to develop more things with foreign countries’ local authorities. And of course, we should create a service to help companies export their products. It is very important for Cosmetica Italia to be recognized as a national reference entity by the main global players. Premium Beauty News - Services, services, more and more services! Renato Ancorotti - Of course! But we need to make them more and more profitable, interesting, and better-adapted to our members, by increasing our revenue, and then reinvesting them in the association’s activities. Premium Beauty News - Communication and marketing are essentials today… Renato Ancorotti - That’s true! Hence our analysis and search for potential partners to help us better know and analyze our customers’ needs. In addition, to better communicate, we should optimize our database. I also intend to strengthen our internal and external communication campaigns. Premium Beauty News - It seems you also want to redefine the scope of a few sectors within the association… Renato Ancorotti - Indeed! That of packaging in particular should be included, so that we can represent our branch more efficiently. 
Cosmetics represent a field of excellence for the “Made in Italy” mark, but we will need to better focus our communications on it, so we can keep improving the trust in and reputation of our industry. We need to reinforce relationships with business stakeholders and ensure we take part in new economic and institutional initiatives. Premium Beauty News - What are your plans as regards technical and legislative activities? Renato Ancorotti - It is an essential aspect for any association worthy of its name! We should pay particular attention to the most relevant and emerging issues (for example, the next cosmetics regulation review, the common criteria, e-commerce/selective distribution). We need to help the industry work and efficiently innovate and guarantee regulatory stability. We should take part in the debates and get involved to overcome the technical/regulatory obstacles related to international trade in order to protect and develop export. Premium Beauty News - Last major issue: research and environment… Renato Ancorotti - Again, we will need to promote the collaboration of our study centre with external bodies as well as the creation of training courses in cosmetics. Lastly, I would like to emphasize my commitment as regards ethics and sustainable development. We should encourage all members to commit to environmental strategies, for example by adopting the ISO certification on environmental management, and raise their awareness of corporate social responsibility. In addition, we intend to renew our support to the La Forza e il Sorriso programme, which is meant to help women cope with the visible side effects of the treatments of all cancer types, thanks to free beauty workshops."
Texen completes its reorganization and launches 4.0 transformation,"""Like many successful companies that have become leaders in their market, Texen has grown internationally, relying in particular on a series of acquisitions, starting with Mar-Lee in the United States, followed by C+N Packaging in 2014 and Topline the following year,"" explains Ludovic Anceau, CEO of Texen and President of the Luxury Goods and Beauty Business Unit of PSB Industries. Indeed, Texen’s history looks like a success story. Strongly anchored in the French ""Plastics Valley"", Europe’s biggest cluster of plastic converters, the company has a strong industrial culture. As part of the PSB Industries group, it can also rely on a stable family shareholding, firmly committed to its development. ""Thanks to significant investments that have allowed a very high level of automation, Texen is one of the packaging suppliers that have managed to maintain most their activities in France,"" stresses Ludovic Anceau. A real asset when the time of relocation has come, under the pressure of requests for agility and speed to market. The arrival of Ludovic Anceau at the head of the company coincided with the integration of Topline. ""In a context of changing demands from our customers, it was the right moment to combine industrial and trading capabilities. The acceleration of launches, the reduction of development times, the mushrooming of small series and the lower visibility in the medium and long term, meant a more agile and more responsive organization adapted to a variety of brand needs."" With eleven industrial sites around the world and four sales offices (Paris, New York, Sao Paulo, Shanghai), the PSB Industries Group’s Luxury Goods and Beauty Business Unit is now based on three pillars: Texen Industries, Texen Beauty Partners and Texen Innovation. With its strong technological expertise, the industrial base of the pole was renamed Texen Industries. It is dedicated to exclusive and personalized packaging, developed around the world as close as possible to customers through an industrial network spreading over three continents. The Mayet (mascara, lipgloss) and CMSI (closures, perfumes, skincare and selective boxes) French sites are the spearheads of Texen Industries. Each of these factories is linked to two other sites of the group for a bigger capacity. This new organization will make it possible to rationalize and mutualize investments, in particular to continue the transformation of production sites towards Industry 4.0 with a view to greater flexibility and agility. ""Several sites of the beauty pole are already very advanced on this subject. CMSI, for instance, operates highly automated lines and Mayet is installing its first 4.0 line for a multi decoration mascara and multi formats project. This experience will serve as a basis for a complete 4.0 industrialization of the plant,"" explains Ludovic Anceau. By divesting from its Food and Retail Business Unit (CGL Pack), PSB Industries has given itself the financial means to initiate its transformation while giving itself the possibility to make new acquisitions in the luxury and beauty sector. ""We remain in an industrial logic to strengthen the group through complementary acquisitions where it will be useful, either in geographic terms or product and technological terms."" The sourcing and full-service base, dubbed Texen Beauty Partners, is designed to meet the needs of customers who do not necessarily invest in individual moulds but are in need of innovation and speed to market. Organized around the group’s trading entities in Europe, the United States and a sourcing hub in China, Texen Beauty Partners relies on a strong network of partners, particularly in Asia, and enables the co-development of global solutions, from formulation to accessories, in addition to the industrial offer. For Ludovic Anceau: ""What is important in full service is to master the logistics of products and the chain of services at local and global levels. This allows to quickly be able to address a request and respond precisely to specific customer demands."" Finally, Texen Innovation must allow the Luxury and Beauty business unit to better analyse the markets and better target innovations and investments. Texen Innovation brings together the marketing, communication and innovation functions of the pole at the global level. Besides the marketing team, the development team was strengthened. ""More than an organizational change, it is a structural transformation. We are moving from the juxtaposition of independent SMEs to the collaboration of complementary poles and skills,"" insists Ludovic Anceau. Simultaneously, Texen is strengthening its CSR policy. A manager has been recruited to meet the expectations of customers in this field, and anticipate them. Texen is also investing heavily in human resources with the creation of a ""Texen School"", in training and in the search for new profiles to meet the challenges of the digital revolution. ""Today, we must be ready to react to all scenarios and be moving on all positions, according to the needs of the customers. This requires agile factories, reliable partners and robust skills across different product categories,"" concludes Ludovic Anceau."
The Granado Group continues to grow in Brazil and in Europe,"Premium Beauty News - You purchased Granado in 1994, as the historic brand was in need of modernization. Twenty years later, it embodies – again – the dynamism of Brazilian cosmetics with many points of sale and the beginnings of its global development. Christopher Freeman - Granado is the oldest cosmetics brand in Brazil. Mr Granado, the founder’s grandson, sold it as they were facing difficulties. We repositioned it based on its beautiful heritage associated with its apothecary origins. The first wholly-owned store opened ten years ago, and there are now 62 of them all over the country. We are also present in a concept store in Portugal, in France, and more widely in Europe, through the on and offline Sephora network, where our products have been available for a few weeks. Premium Beauty News - Is France Granado’s other favourite country? Sissi Freeman - It is, the brand has received a warm welcome there. We arrived in France thanks to the Bon Marché department store five years ago. Our products very quickly found their public, which encouraged us to open a store on Bonaparte Street. We have been considering the opportunity of opening a second point of sale in the Marais quarter, where we are actually represented from May 25 to June 17 in the Paris de Janeiro pop-up store. And we also have an e-shop. Premium Beauty News - Are you considering developing in other countries or continents? Christopher Freeman - It is important to do this step by step. The fact that we recently got access to the Sephora network helps us be present in 230 points of sale in Europe. We are going to open a wholly-owned store in Lisbon, and then maybe in England or Germany, why not? Premium Beauty News - Today, you are putting Phebo forward by opening three stores in Brazil by August. Sissi Freeman - We wanted to give this brand more space, because it does not get as much as it deserves in Granado stores. Phebo is a brand from Belém known of all Brazilians for several generations for its soaps and fragrances. It really embodies Brazil, and that is what customers will find in store, with a modern decoration focused on local ingredients and materials like wood and plants in a very colourful setting. The experience is different from Granado’s pharmaceutical culture. Phebo stores will highlight ingredients and customization. For example, customers will be able to have their perfume bottles engraved in store. The first Perfumaria Phebo will open in June in the Leblon quarter of Rio, and then another will be inaugurated in July in Curitiba, and a third in August in São Paulo. Premium Beauty News - What has changed since the Puig group acquired shares in the company in 2016? Christopher Freeman - The support Puig provided is a precious help for us, with new technologies, in particular in the field of perfumery. It also helps us strengthen our investments. It is a family group, we work with the same spirit. It was a very good decision. Premium Beauty News - Are all Granado/Phebo products made in Brazil? Christopher Freeman - We make almost everything – formulas, packaging, and finished products - in our brand new plant located one hour from Rio, and for which we have just invested 150 million reais. Only makeup products and specific packaging are outsourced. Premium Beauty News - How is the market doing given the economic and political situation in Brazil? Christopher Freeman - The cosmetics market maintained itself during the crisis, and it started growing again in 2017. As regards Granado, we have always done much better than the market. Our sales rose by 15% in the first quarter, compared to 2017. But for now, the overall situation is still unclear and should remain so until 2019."
Nippon Shikizai: Japanese innovation boosting European mascara,"Mascara is one of the most used makeup products among Asian women. It is the everyday beauty gesture: in front of the mirror, while commuting to work, in the office before an important meeting... Creating the perfect mascara formula therefore became Nippon Shikizai’s priority. In fact, it is a real challenge that was taken up by the Japanese leader because, according to experts, eyelashes of Asian women are stiff, short, ""fan shaped"" and pointing downwards! The tests and research conducted by the Company have finally enabled Nippon Shikizai’s formulators to formulate THE mascara with a ""doe-eye"" effect (the one worn by Natalie Portman and Bella Hadid). ""Bringing to life the dreams of Asian women was not easy,"" explained one of Nippon Shikizai’s formulators, Mai Akimoto. ""I also have typical Asian eyelashes. To find myself beautiful, I feel the need to give length, curve and volume to my lashes."" In general, Japanese women are very meticulous and follow, as for so many other things, a set ritual during their makeup routine. Perfection is a prerequisite for the Japanese, Chinese or Korean consumer, which involves applying the right product, with the right brush and with a precise gesture. We mustn’t forget the unfavourable environment, knowing that climate in Asian countries is often hot and humid and you will have a complete snapshot of the issues related to the development of a mascara for the Japanese market. Mascara must indeed be water resistant. Ultimate issue: Asian women don’t like waterproof mascaras, which are too difficult to remove. From this observation, Nippon Shikizai developed an ultra-innovative formula called the ""Warm Water Washable Mascara"".  To date, more than 100 million mascaras based on Nippon Shikizai’s top-formula have already been sold in Asia. ""Now our goal is to make this innovation available for European brands and consumers. European lashes being very different from Asian lashes, we needed to find a European partner capable of designing a brush perfectly compatible with our formula and with the morphology of European lashes, to sublimate the beauty of Western women. We worked with the Albéa Group, the leading designer of mascara packs and brushes in order to combine our expertise and co-develop an optimal make-up solution,"" explained Tsuyoshi Hasuo, President of Thépenier Pharma & Cosmetics and Nippon Shikizai France, the European subsidiaries of the Nippon Shikizai Group. ""The Albéa industrial facility in Bottanuco near Milan was used as a meeting point for Albéa’s Tips Studio teams and Nippon Shikizai’s formulation team. We tested all possible combinations on European lashes to come up with the perfect brush/formula compatibility. The result of the collaboration is a success. Nippon Shikizai can now offer European customers an innovative formula, which has already won over millions of Asian consumers with a combination of pack + bush + formulation perfectly adapted to their type of lashes,"" he added. At the end of the month, on its stand at the MakeUp in Paris trade show, Nippon Shikizai will again demonstrate its formidable capacity for innovation by presenting its new collection on the theme of ""J-Beauty"", and will give pride of place to the mascara originating from its collaboration with Albéa."
Aircos is moving up a gear,"The Aircos company actually holds a long track record, which begun in 1952 with the creation of the Airsec company and a patent granted for a desiccating process and which later lead to the creation of Aircos. Four important milestones will have marked the company’s development. In 1989 with the construction of a second production plant in Ardon, France, to support the other French plant in Romorantin who will later specialize in makeup. Then 2000 sees the creation of a R&D Formulation Laboratory in Paris, at the Group’s headquarters, specialized in the formulation of powders. In 2012, Aircos developed its brand new in-house Back Injection, IPM process. And finally, in 2015, the Company decides to focus on the development of its export sales. Needless to say, the IPM process was clearly a very smart idea!? ""With this back-injection process developed six years ago,"" explains Sirot. ""We can really put forward our mastery of the container/content compatibility. This technology which stems from our expertise as formulation and injection specialists was fully developed in-house. And most of all, our process allows highlighting all the properties of the ingredients (in particular pigments and nacres) and resulting in astonishing softness, brightness and payoff. We have also clearly benefited from the craze for products with a metal effect, where our IPM process delivers unmatched performances."" This technology is so successful that Aircos today has no trouble feeding its ten IPM machines running in Romorantin. ""IPM is undeniably one of our key assets,"" underlines Sirot, ""this is why we continue building on the potential of our R & D laboratories to keep on innovating."" ""Our export sales have jumped from 5% four years ago to almost 50% today!"" says Thomas Sirot.  “In recent years, we haven’t stopped proposing very innovative and truly differentiating formulas in all the areas of the products we manufacture with the industrial guarantee of complying with GMP standards. We have also invested a great deal commercially, particularly on the two Coasts the United States, but also in the Middle East. Proposing and producing our own packaging is undeniably a very important asset in times when demand for Full Service is so high.” It must be said that Aircos’ Ardon plant is home to some 35 injection and bi-injection machines ranging from 25 tons to 330 tons. Production lines which are dedicated to makeup cases, intermediate size packagings or samples, without forgetting printing and assembling machines. Total industrial investments, including the extension of the Romorantin makeup site, amounted for the two sites in 2017 and 2018, to EUR 4.5 million. A figure to compare to the 10 million achieved in 2014! Quite a track record for this family-run French SME of 170 people which integrated in December 2017 another family owned Group, Anjac Health & Beauty, posting EUR 190 million. in sales and with very complementary activities in terms of formulation, manufacture and packaging of health, beauty, medical devices and hygiene products. The acquisition of Aircos is part of Anjac’s ambition to build a group of companies with high added value. The expertise of the SME in the area of makeup enables the Company to strengthen its field of expertise and therefore to diversify its offer. The integration of Aircos is also in line with the commitment of the Anjac Group for promoting French industrial excellence, an asset already recognized for the six other Group companies: Sicaf, Chemineau, Eurowipes, Shadeline, LPEV and more recently Pascual."
Le Jardin Retrouvé survey community for next fragrance,"As a perfumer for Roure Bertrand (now known as Givaudan) as from 1935, Yuri Gutsatz created many fragrances for Carven, Dior, or Estée Lauder. In the 1970s, the cutting edge artist claimed a third path in perfumery. “With his writings and firm stance, he really theorized this concept of parallel perfumery. He defended perfumers’ freedom to create without being subject to marketing constraints and, above all, to choose the raw materials themselves, in all palettes,” Clara Feder emphasized. Revived by son Michel with the support of young perfumer Maxence Moutte, the brand now counts seven fragrances re-released exactly as they were in accordance with the current IFRA standards. This return was made possible thanks to the creator’s iconoclastic vision, this large freedom of choice as regards the ingredients and their sourcing, an eco-responsible approach, and a unique refillable bottle. As far as communication is concerned, the brand puts an emphasis on the interpersonal relationships with customers and enthusiasts on social media. The brand chose to nurture this close relationship by making their community take part in the whole process, including the choice of the next perfume. Out of the 2,000 formulas making up Yuri Gutsatz’s professional heritage, an invaluable olfactory testament representing a whole career, four were selected for their exclusive qualities and modernity. Today, the final choice is made by the customers, the influencers, and the brand’s lovers. “We deeply believe that giving the power to our customers – some of them have been loyal to the brand for decades – and perfume lovers all over the world is the most beautiful tribute we could pay to my humanist and cosmopolitan father, a creator of perfumes,” Michel Gutsatz explains. It has actually been possible for a month -and until June 15 - to submit a request on the dedicated website www.perfumeparty.paris in order to receive samples of the four perfumes selected. Four 3 ml mini-sprays identified with a colour are then sent to the participants, who can express their colour choice on the website. “People actually make determined choices for one fragrance or the other. They make a blind choice, red or yellow or black, always with much passion,” comments Clara Feder. The consultation relayed by bloggers and influencers is available in 34 countries in the five continents, and over 300 tests have already been ordered. The winning perfume will be unveiled on June 24, and then offered in limited edition and numbered by hand in bottles that had been chosen by Yuri Gutsatz for the preferential rate of 100 euros for 50 ml."
Novacap asserts its ambitions and invests in blockchain technology,"Today established as the worldwide leader for salicylic acid, Novacap [1] has also an excellent position in other essential ingredients, such as methyl salicylate and sodium bicarbonate. The company now intends to leverage on its global leadership positions in pharmaceuticals to conquer the cosmetic market. For the last three years, Novacap has significantly broaden its cosmetic portfolio via several key acquisitions: Uetikon, in 2015, a German company specializing in tailor made synthesis of complex molecules for pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, Chemoxy in 2017, a British company, specialized in custom processing, solvent recovery, environmentally friendly solvents, and specialty personal care ingredients such as emollient, preservative booster esters, and in 2017 too, ID bio, a French company specialized in classical or biotechnological extraction and purification of botanical substances, and PCAS, a company specializing in the development and manufacturing of complex molecules for life science industries. This dynamic mergers and acquisitions strategy, completed by the group’s initial know-how in pharmaceutics and fine chemistry, now allows Novacap to offer a cutting-edge portfolio for the cosmetic market. A comprehensive cosmetic offer Functional Care
– Essential ingredients such as Salicylic acid and Sodium Bicarbonate
– Classical ingredients such as ChemoxyCare®8 (Caprylyl glycol), and ChemoxyCare®2EHG  Active Care
– Active ingredients
 -Botanicals… Services
– Fine chemistry (new molecule synthesis, Biocatalysis, Protein engineering tool…)
– Botanicals (customized plant extracts, active co-creation…)
– Full service finished products… In line with its strong ambition, Novacap has chosen to invest in the blockchain technology, which will be deployed first in the group’s botanical and biotech active business units by the end of 2018. “The first ambition is to guaranty the traceability of organic active ingredients, in compliance with Ecocert/Cosmos label, from raw material purchase to finished product shipment,” the company highlights."
"Wide Society, the new eco-responsible brand by The Different Company","Wide Society packaging materials are recyclable (glass, aluminium, linen, cotton) and/or made of certified recycled materials (cardboard). Only the pumps, which can be unscrewed, are based on plastic. This way, the new brand successfully rides on the sustainable wave of daily perfumes, with convenient travel-size packs to be refilled over and over again. Three case versions are available: – Escapade, a travel kit made of cotton containing three mini refillable 10 ml bottles (EUR45);
– Weekender, composed of six 10 ml bottles and of the funnel (EUR80);
– The big size 100 ml linen case, funnel and capsule included, available for 95 euros, which makes it possible to refill mini bottles if needed, or can be left in the bathroom. Each case presents a perfume Absolu among the six fragrances created by the brand’s perfumers, Émilie Coppermann (Symrise) and Alexandra Monet (Drom). These six creations, Acqua Travelis, Up in the Air, Sign of Times, Nubes, Suite#6, and Night Air, make up an anthology of varied trails, from the most ethereal to the most sensual for a long-lasting result, thanks to the 20% concentration of Absolu. Wide Society will be mainly present on European and North-American markets, on different distribution channels: perfume stores, travel retail, department stores, concept stores…"
Beauty Success Group launches a “neo-perfumery” concept,"Within the context of a receding selective market, Beauty Success Group set itself broader objectives focused on beauty services to seize growth opportunities. “We believe there is a territory to conquer, which highlights both selective and niche brands and meets new consumer expectations involving highly-personalized, tailor-made advice,” Stéphanie Chalard asserts. One may think about a return to the codes of the perfumery trade, but Stéphanie Chalard prefers to talk about neo-perfumery with a very modern approach. Their points of sale will lay out an offering combining niche and selective products and featuring a high-end salon. “We consider there is a population that wants to have access to a selection of the two types of products, but with a highly specialized service. It is all based on the customer relationship. This service will involve sustained training for our advisors about the art of welcoming customers and getting to know them, not only through their purchases, but also through their own personality,” she adds. The group has also been working on this approach with its partner brands. “It is a very popular concept among brands, because they think we revive and build up an identity for the selective network.” Today, the family group counts five brand networks, the flagship channel being the Beauty Success selective stores – 320 perfume stores/salons mainly settled in small and medium-sized cities – completed with 170 Esthetic Center salons. The three other brands are making progress: Beauty Full Days, a new generation of beauty salons, the Parapharmacie Tanguy network and Beauty Sisters for Millennials. This new concept, whose name will be unveiled when the first store opens in June in Périgueux, completes the cluster of existing brands, but it will not depend on the Beauty Success brand. A second opening should be scheduled for early 2019 to set up a national network mainly settled in big cities in the long run."
Parfums Berdoues to enrich their offering,"Initially based on transmission, innovation, and creativity values, the Berdoues group is now present in 40 countries with about ten brands – an exemplary development for this family SME that managed to revitalize their market generation after generation. Henri Berdoues’s iconic 1930s creations, like Colognes by the 1902 brand, or Violette de Toulouse, were followed by an opening to supermarket channels with Blondépil and Petits Plaisirs by Pierre Berdoues in the 1960s. In the 2000s, his daughter Sophie initiated the purchase of the ELLES and IKKS licences, as well as of Molyneux perfumes, very popular for export. Iconic and historical brand 1902 has just been enriched with a range of body skincare products based on natural ingredients perfumed with the Mille Fleurs Berdoues olfactory signature. The 1967 Pierre Berdoues mille fleurs, a container intended for collecting the results of unsuccessful tests performed by perfumers during olfactory sessions, led to the creation of a unique olfactory concentrate. Today, this floral formula, which was preciously preserved for 50 years, is associated with the range’s formulas composed of 90% to 98% natural ingredients. Each of the eight skincare products (scrub, milk, shower gel, soap, water, hand cream…) has its own complex comprising two to five plant-derived actives. The range has been available in pharmacies and parapharmacies since late February. Since it was launched, the Collection Grands Crus has known a real success in alternative perfumery, in particular in the United States and Europe, thanks to its complex associations and raw materials carefully selected all around the world. At the very beginning, the collection was based on the olfactory interpretation of a world region by a master perfumer. The range has now been enriched with a new Peng Lai fragrance by Sébastien Martin to pay tribute to a Chinese legend. This fruity, floral fragrance unveils an alliance between Osmanthus, a Chinese precious material, Laotian benzoin, and Brazilian tonka bean. The new 100 ml version has been available since late February for 80 euros."
TechnicoFlor continues its international expansion with the opening of a creative centre in Dubai,"With a total surface area of approximately 300m2, TechnicoFlor Dubai facility will feature a sampling laboratory and an olfactory and aromatic creative centre. By the end of 2018, the new structure should have ten employees (the subsidiary manager, an evaluator, a creative perfumer, a sales person, and the marketing department ...). The group’s goal is to better meet the needs of its customers in the Gulf countries and the Middle East, including the United Arab Emirates, Iran and Pakistan, which are big consumers of perfumes. ""These markets have unique and well-differentiated olfactory preferences, and it was important for TechnicoFlor to dedicate a specific centre for them,"" explained François-Patrick Sabater, the TechnicoFlor Group’s CEO. As a preview of the opening of the new centre, TechnicoFlor will unveil a series of new olfactory creations at the Beauty World Middle East show, to be held on 8-10 May 2018 in Dubai. Designed by the group’s perfumers - Bertrand Duchaufour and Pierre Flores - the launches will include amber, oud, woody, floral, rosé and iridescent scents. The company will also showcase 10 mukhallats, ""pure perfumes, very popular in the Middle East, with musk, sensual, animal, leather, spicy and smoky notes."" Since its creation in 1982, TechnicoFlor has tapped into international markets. The group, which today has 200 employees including a team of 8 perfume creators, sells its products in more than 60 countries including the Middle East, Asia, Western and Central Europe. The group generates more than 70% of its turnover (almost 60 million euros in 2017) from exports, particularly in Asian markets. ""With production centres in China, France, Miami and Jakarta, creative centres in Marseille, Paris, Dubai and an office in Singapore, we are able to create olfactory and aromatic compositions that meet all types of expectations for a wide array of markets and to supply our customers all over the world,"" said François-Patrick Sabater. The group aims to continue its international expansion with the upcoming opening of another creative office in New York and further aims to enter the Brazilian and Indian markets. However, TechnicoFlor is also striving to consolidate its position in the French market. The group recently started a EUR 12 million investment for the construction of new production facilities in Marseille. The two environment-friendly new units will open their doors during the summer 2019. Featuring a total surface area of more than 5000 m2, they will allow the company to double its production capacity. ""Our customers are looking for our creativity and our range of natural raw materials developed over the last 10 years, including our own patchouli supply chain in Indonesia. They appreciate our responsiveness, and especially our ability to deliver small batches, which greatly interest famous perfume, cosmetic or household product companies when they develop new ranges,"" concluded the group president."
Amorepacific Group gives a boost to global expansion,"Amorepacific is giving a boost to its international development. The group has just announced the launch of Hera - it’s luxury beauty brand - in Singapore this coming May.  A new challenge for the Korean brand, which was launched successfully in China in 2016.  “With a high demand in global brands and great interest in trends, Singapore strategically is a very important market for Amorepacific. Even before its launch, consumers showed much interest in the trend leading brand Hera. On May 10, Hera will be opening its first store in Takashimaya Department Store located in Singapore’s main shopping street. Hera will also be opening a boutique store within the first half of 2018,” announced the group in a release. Amos Professional - Korea’s number one hair professional brand - will also make its first step into the global market by launching in Singapore. Mamonde entered US’ biggest beauty retailer Ulta in the past March, and innisfree recently made its debut in Japan. The group is also actively paving its way to previously untouched markets. Amorepacific established new corporate offices in Dubai, UAE, and in Melbourne, Australia. The entry into the Middle East started with the launch of Etude House, the company’s makeup brand dedicated to millennials, last month, in partnership with the with Alshaya Group, the largest retailer in the region.  The first Etude House store in the Middle East opened on March 17 in the Dubai Mall, the country’s biggest shopping mall. A second store opened on March 22 in The Avenues Mall, Kuwait’s largest shopping mall. The brand will expand its business to neighbouring countries with another store scheduled to open in Saudi Arabia within the first half of this year. Eventually, the group recently announced its entry in Australia with the launch of Laneige, its global premium brand, at Sephora on March 14.  The company plans to launch Amorepacific, its luxury flagship brand of the same name, and Innisfree, its global natural and eco-friendly beauty brand later this year. Amorepacific is well known for having launched and sold millions of cushion compacts globally. The company intends to take advantage of global interest in the K-beauty to become one of the world’s beauty giants. To achieve this goal the group needs to consolidate its market shares in Asia, in particular by addressing competition from Japanese brands, while diversifying its global reach."
"Jacques Fath perfumes, a limitless renewal","The Maison had been asleep for several decades, leaving Green Water and Iris Gris lovers with their own memories. When Rania Naïm revived Jacques Fath, she aimed to give these fragrances their rightful place back, while creating a world faithful to the avant-gardist, modern personality of their creator, a contemporary of Christian Dior. “I wanted to convey his spirit through perfumes,” she explains. She immediately thought about Cécile Zarokian, an independent perfumer who designed many alternative perfumery creations. “I was very honoured, but also much impressed, because Jacques Fath perfumes are great references in perfumery”, Cécile Zarokian reveals. The first Fath’s Essentials collection was born in 2016, inspired from the world of travel and colours. It featured three free creations, but most of all, the re-edition of the famous Green Water. “Working on such a monument was a real challenge for me. This perfume has its own enthusiasts, so they had expectations and I could not disappoint them,” explains Cécile Zarokian. To get as close as possible to the 1947 original version by perfumer Vincent Roubert, she worked with her nose only, without any formula, based on the original fragrance stored at the Osmothèque, the world’s perfume archive based in Versailles, France. Just like in the fashion designer’s era, when the price of the concentrate did not matter and the creation quality prevailed, Rania Naïm let the creator work with much freedom of choice, in particular in terms of raw material quantities. “There is no such thing as a briefing for these perfumes, I let creators work and I do not impose any budget limit, but the raw materials need to be beautiful,” the artistic director confirms. For example, to revive its original trail, Green Water required 5% of Néroli essence. “It is huge, but it is essential, because other than its Hesperidia and aromatic aspects, Néroli is really one of the key ingredients in this perfume,” adds Cécile Zarokian, who is delighted with the freedom of action she also enjoyed for the composition of the three other juices in the collection: Curaçao Bay, Vers le Sud, and sensual Bel Ambre. In 2017, a second collection composed by Italian perfumer Luca Maffei enriched the brand’s world with four new fragrances directly inspired from the creator’s work. The two perfumers will be gathered for a new collection in 2019. Two years after this rebirth, Jacques Fath perfumes are now focusing on the other major reference of the Maison, Iris Gris. The re-edition, called Iris de Fath, has just been showcased at the Milan Esxence show. The creation constraints were the same as for Green Water. Without any existing formula, there was no choice but to recompose the fragrance using the nose, which required a whole year of development. Concerned about being as faithful as possible to the mythical original version, Rania Naïm felt the need to collaborate with a jury of great perfumers: she opened the challenge to different creators. “It was so important that we could not be the only ones to decide. I contacted the best noses for all our different proposals,” she explains. After a blind test, the jury unanimously chose the version of young perfumer Patrice Revillard, of independent perfume laboratory Maelström. The high quantities of Iris concrete and absolute make it the most expensive concentrate in the world. As such, only 150 bottles of perfume will be edited every year, for about 1,500 euros for 30 ml. The bottle design is identical to the original and completed with a few more sophisticated touches. The Iris Gris rebirth is announced as one of the milestones of the year in the world of high perfumery."

"“Cross-border e-commerce is well-adapted to the Chinese beauty market”, Joël Palix, Feelunique","“Feelunique achieves a turnover of more than 100 million pounds, mainly online, by offering 550 cosmetics brands to distribute their products all around the world overnight,” the CEO explains. Based on a cross-border e-commerce model, the British platform founded in 2004 only settled in China in October 2015. Then, they contacted Azoya, a Shenzhen-based company, which developed the Chinese version of the Feelunique website and manages merchandising, marketing, and customer service on the local level. “Right now, we are distributing 350 brands and 20% of our global sales are made in China,” explains Joël Palix. To him, this success is due to the fact that Chinese people shop a lot online (the beauty market in China represents 12% of global sales, but 30% of online sales on the global level), and are extremely well-informed. “Chinese consumers spend hours trying to get information on brands that are not available in China on platforms specifically created to this end, like Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book). That is why the cross-border model is real relevant.” Local e-commerce is only a limited part of the market, “because Chinese people do not trust local platforms, which can sell potentially harmful counterfeits when it comes to cosmetics. So, they prefer to turn to Western websites,” says Joël Palix. The latter also offer less expensive products, because there are fewer taxes: Chinese buyers are sensitive to this advantage. For foreign brands, the cross-border model is a means to penetrate the Chinese market faster, “otherwise it takes 6 to 18 months to register products on the local level,” Joël Palix warns. “Then, the products need to be approved by Chinese authorities, who impose animal testing, and many brands consider it unethical.” The cross-border model is absolutely legal in China. As a result, companies can get rid of burdensome constraints and test the market without much investment. All this does not mean you will be successful, no matter what, since the key for brands is to attract people’s attention and create a community, whether online or in real life. “Today, Chinese consumers want more than a product, they want to interact with the brand and feel like they belong to a community, a specific lifestyle,” Joël Palix reiterates. “The platform you use is actually less important than the quality of your content and how you adapt to the Chinese calendar, how you build up your relationship with consumers, even outside China, through KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders) or the Chinese diaspora abroad – they can spread the word to their families and friends in China.” Right now, WeChat remains the essential platform if you want to reach the Chinese public. “It is our main driver today. It is crucial to develop a strategy specific to WeChat, with an exclusively Chinese content,” emphasizes Joël Palix, explaining that Feelunique is not present on major platforms like Tmall and JD.com. “That made people rather sceptical when we launched our brand in China.” “However, we are now open to other platforms, including Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book), and we do everything to make sure our model is the right one in this fast-changing Chinese environment.” To Joël Palix, Feelunique has gained efficacy in terms of global functioning since the company entered China, because “this country leads the way in the field of online beauty sales.”"
"After five acquisitions in three years, KDC is targeting another twofold increase in sales!","Indeed the KDC Group (Knowlton Development Corporation) has quite a track record! It all started in 2002 with the creation of the Emballages Knowlton Company, employing 300 people, with sales of $80 million.  In 2003, the investment fund Novacap took control of the Company. The first acquisitions took place in 2007 with the Tri Tech Laboratories and Body Blue Inc Companies. But it is in 2014 that things really started accelerating, with the launch of the Novacap Industries IV fund, which gave the Group the financial tools to fulling their expansionist strategy. In January 2015, KDC acquired the ChemAid Laboratories, a formulator and manufacturer of skincare, hair care and bath and body products with a plant in Saddle Brook, New Jersey. On October 14 and 21 of the same year, KDC acquired the companies of Kolmar Laboratories and Acupac Packaging from the Kolmar Labs Group, a New-York-based custom formulator and manufacturer of color cosmetics, personal care and skincare products, and of Cosmetic Technologies, a California-based cosmetics and personal care products contract manufacturer. The latter acquisition allowed the Canadian Group to extend its scope to the West Coast. The conquest of the West continued with the takeover on 16 November 2016 of Thibiant International, a formulator and manufacturer of personal and skincare products based in Chatsworth, California. “We found particularly attractive Thibiant’s innovation-driven business model, its high-tech facilities and equipment, its exceptional client base,"" emphasized Nicholas Whitley. On November 9, 2017, the KDC Group took over the Aromair Fine Fragrance Company, a full-service manufacturer and supplier specializing in home and air care categories based in New Albany, Ohio. One month later, on December 12, KDC officials announced the acquisition of Northern Labs, a full-service liquid product contract manufacturer serving the personal and home care markets. Located in Wisconsin, the company is specialising in liquid, gel, lotion, and paste products. For Nicholas Whitley, the adventure is far from over.  After this impressive series of acquisitions, KDC Group started the structuring of their offer as a global leader in beauty innovation. At the MakeUp in Los Angeles tradeshow in February, KDC launched their newly branded image, “kdc/one” to the industry.  “One” network of reputable, best-in-class custom formulators and manufacturers that collectively deliver high-touch innovation, operational excellence, and speed to market to established and emerging beauty, personal care and home care companies. To further send the message that kdc/one is committed to being the leader and destination for true innovation, the network is gearing up to open the doors to their state-of-the-art Innovation Lab this summer in Saddle Brook, NJ. What’s next for kdc/one?  “The goal of one billion dollar turnover is now within sight and the next growth stages could very well be in Europe and Asia.  Kdc/one is a force to be reckoned with and we are excited to build on this momentum to provide the highest level of quality, service and innovation to our brand partners,” said Nicholas Whitley."
"“We are diversifying our development and aiming for a EUR100 million turnover”, Laurent Mercier, CEO Eurofragance","Premium Beauty News - You joined the group four years ago. Laurent Mercier - Four beautiful years. Eurofragance is the wonderful story of a family company founded 27 years ago. At that time, visionary Santiago Sabatés successfully developed his company in the Middle East. When I joined the group in 2013, 90% of our turnover was achieved with exports, including 80% in the Gulf. This Catalan firm is little-known in certain regions, and yet Eurofragance is the leader in oriental perfumery: it is ahead of the biggest global players in fine perfumery there, including Firmenich, Givaudan, and IFF. Today, we aim to open new markets and new categories, so the idea when I came here in 2013 was for me to diversify activities, while preserving our leadership in Fine Fragrance in the Middle East. Premium Beauty News - Has the change of direction been initiated? Laurent Mercier - We opened a development centre in Dubai in autumn 2015 with 25 people, two perfumers, laboratories, an analysis team, and a sales force. The development phase used to be managed from Spain. In June 2016, we inaugurated a second, 1,100 m2 centre in Singapore, and then a plant last year, still in Singapore. All this involves our production for Asia. The first subsidiary of the group was created in 2009 in Mexico City, where we have more than 40 employees and a plant mainly dedicated to the Central American market. Ultimately, last December, we bought Atlanta-based Fragrance Design in the United States, to make it easier for us to penetrate this huge market at the right time. In Europe, we have put back our Turkish subsidiary on the rails. It completes our centre and plant in Barcelona. Turkey is both an interesting and competitive market. So, today, we count five development centres, in Spain, Mexico, Dubai, Singapore, and Atlanta, as well as four production plants. In terms of infrastructure, we have everything we need. To me, it was essential not to centralize it all. The Sales Director is in Dubai, the perfumer manager is in Singapore, and so is the Development Director. The idea is to create a real global group, a Fragrance House boutique with 13 perfumers and as many evaluators. Today, Eurofragance represents 300 people, 60% in Spain and 40% elsewhere. Premium Beauty News - What markets have you been scrutinizing the most? Laurent Mercier - South-East Asia, because there are several major perfume fortresses like Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia… Thanks to our unique history, we have the advantage of being really familiar with Muslim markets, which makes it easier to penetrate them. There are olfactory bonds that can be worked on in Indonesia and Malaysia. From our Dubai centre, we are taking serious interest in India. It is an economically very dynamic continent country that boasts a real perfume culture. Iran also deserves attention, because you need to be there today to be ready tomorrow. The same goes for Africa. In Europe, we aim to reach niche brands. We are not very demanding in terms of volume, compared to major perfume houses. The complexity of creation even motivates us at a small scale. And we have all the skills needed to succeed in the field of Home Fragrance. Lastly, following recent groupings and acquisitions, the American market has known a concentration that, to us, creates the opportunity to serve small to medium-sized brands. Premium Beauty News - What are your ambitions? Laurent Mercier - For the year 2017, we ended with 72 million euros, i.e. +7.5% compared to 2016, but with a very slow growth in the Gulf region, where it is quite complicated right now due to the different conflicts going on (Yemen, Libya, Syria, Iraq…). We aim to become part of the club that achieves 100 million euro turnovers within the next three to four years, and to stabilize the Gulf region at 50% of our turnover. Eurofragance belongs to a family that is much attached to the industry. Today, there is no discussion about eventually selling the group. Premium Beauty News - What seduced you in this project? Laurent Mercier  - Our new President Santiago Sabatés is a real entrepreneur, meaning he embodies everything the term involves. He knows how to take risks and work things through. I have a more standard manager profile and a global experience, so we complete each other quite well."

"“We’re aiming a 10% market share within two years in France,” Simon Duffy, Bulldog","Premium Beauty News - What’s so special about Bulldog? Simon Duffy - Bulldog is a different brand with a unique offering for men. The male market is very specific. The idea for Bulldog was born when we noticed that there were no straightforward skincare options for men who wanted products packed with natural ingredients.  Bulldog is the first men’s skincare line based on natural ingredients.  The products are also free from a wide list of what we consider as “unwanted” ingredients such as parabens, SLS, artificial colours, synthetic fragrances or ingredients from animal sources. We’re also doing our best with regard to sustainability.  We’re now using sugarcane based plastics from Brazil’s Braskem for our packaging.  That’s a big way for us to stand out from competition! The big difference of course is that we mainly target men. We wanted to create a very male company.  Bulldog is man’s best and smarter companion! Premium Beauty News - You’re now launching in France, which has the reputation to be a difficult market for indie cosmetic brands? Simon Duffy - We’re very excited to be in France. It is the right time as we’re now feeling more comfortable as a company.  Big brands, such as L’Oréal and Nivea, clearly dominate in the French market but now we think we now have the possibility to face the competition here and to address skincare needs of male’s consumers in France with a different offering. As far as cosmetic products are concerned, people want results.  However, they are also increasingly interested in the brands’ values and the way they run their businesses.  It’s getting harder and harder to hide as a company, it is therefore very essential to present good stories and to be authentic. Premium Beauty News - What are your main goals in France? Simon Duffy - We’re launching in France with a selection of 6 products (out of a full line of 40 products) at Carrefour and Carrefour Market, and online at Amazon and beauteprivee.fr For the short-term, we want our products to be available everywhere our competitors are.  This is why we’re launching in the mass retail channel here, while we’re in department stores or speciality retails in other countries. We do not have massive budgets but our brand is very distinctive, our packaging and the way we formulate our products make a huge difference. We’re aiming a 10% market share within two years in France. Premium Beauty News - What are the next steps for Bulldog? Simon Duffy - We’re looking for new market opening such as Japan.  We’re currently available in 24 countries, including Korea, the USA, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Thailand. Export sales represent about 50% of our annual turnover and in the next years we expect them to reach the 70% mark. We want to grow and we are investing in our first TV campaigns and we’re also working on big innovation launches..."
"""IL Cosmetics Group is leveraging its expertise in all areas of make-up,"" Jean-François Harpes, CEO","Premium Beauty News - What is the position of the IL Cosmetics Group today in the make-up market? Jean-François Harpes - We are the European leader for the manufacture of nail polish, serving brands worldwide. For over 34 years, we have been developing premium nail polish formulas, tailored to the needs of each market. Expectations vary from one continent to the other and even countries, so it is essential to have a perfect knowledge of each of them.

While the IL Cosmetics Group is widely recognized for its expertise in nail polish, it has also made use of its know-how in other make-up categories. Premium Beauty News - You are diversifying your activity? Jean-François Harpes - The term diversification could mean no longer focusing on our core business, which remains nail polish. But in fact the Group created several ""expert poles"" for the development of the different types of products. Each of them operates by using the same rigorous testing and development processes that characterize the nail polish pole. Luxcos, our make-up division, boasts more than 15 years of expertise and is enjoying double-digit growth (+ 20% in 2017). We produce mascaras - which already have a strong positioning in the European market - but also lipgloss and liquid eyeliners. We are also working on other products categories. Some of our client have won awards with our mascara formulas. To date, we are less known in the lipgloss category, but we have nonetheless already received positive feedbacks from the market with products fitting exactly the needs of consumers. Our goal is to develop a “one-stop-shop” for all eyes, lips, face and nails cosmetic products. We plan to expand in other cosmetic categories in the coming years, which will certainly contribute to the development of our Group. Premium Beauty News - On what growth drivers does IL Cosmetics rely? Jean-François Harpes - Our growth and the development of our expertise relies on two approaches: Cosmetic Intelligence and Leading Innovation.

The Cosmetic Intelligence approach combines our knowledge of the market with our know-how and our ability to offer complete, ready-to-use turnkey solutions adapted to the needs of our clients. With these drivers, we were able to develop different expert poles, which enable the Group to have a multi-product offer: mascaras, lipgloss, liquid eyeliners mainly. Premium Beauty News - Are you ready in terms of infrastructure? Jean-François Harpes - In our preparation we have neglected no aspect. Not only in terms of R&D resources and investments, but also concerning our production capacity, which today offers great flexibility for the production and filling of many different products. IL Cosmetics had already boosted its industrial development with a 40 million-euro investment plan over the 2013-2018 period. In Poland, the packing unit, which was recently expanded, now enjoys a filling capacity of 240 million units. A second multi-product packing unit of 10,000 m2 will ensure our capability and flexibility to absorb new multi-product developments, whatever the category."
"“We are building a real Hub of Innovation”, Fabrizio Buscaini, Chromavis CEO","Premium Beauty News - How do you address this new challenge? Fabrizio Buscaini - The challenge is to instil in Chromavis a new mentality and a new product vision totally based on a motivated, “hungry” and proud team, as well as an outstanding Industrial Plan at its basis. The goal for the Company is to create and produce products with extraordinary quality that change and adapt themselves to the market mutations. Currently, Chromavis is focused on its internal reorganization that will be based on speed and flexible solutions, thought specifically for both clients and market needs. Chromavis has proudly created products that have become true and real “distinctive categories”, but it has also the awareness that is not enough to have a complete “product portfolio”, it always has the necessary courage to reinvent itself, to try new ways to think, produce and create. Premium Beauty News - A brand new plant in 2020!  Fabrizio Buscaini - Chromavis is changing its way of seeing and thinking, furthermore, it’s also planning to relocate in brand new headquarters that will unify all three existing Italian sites in just one area, in order to support the ambitious growth to double the turnover in 2020. It is also necessary to build a new corporate culture, and to generate a new business model for Chromavis. Clients expect smart solutions and these cannot be linked only to bulk production. The goal is to create products with a value and, why not, uniqueness. If we look to the future, the most important development perspective for Chromavis is linked to the construction of its new headquarters (an area of 100,000 m²) that, as announced, will be ready by 2020. The project foresees the construction of a real Hub of Innovation, a place to be proud to be part of, with wide green areas, interiors illuminated with natural lights and pleasant and stimulating common working areas. Premium Beauty News - What is your insight concerning these major changes in you sector? Fabrizio Buscaini - Mapping our sector is increasingly difficult; the on-line business dynamics have changed the rules. The market is very fast, consumers are well-informed thanks to the online selling platforms and social networking. Their requests are extremely demanding and clear: high performances, new concepts and products delivering promises which are immediately perceivable by the end consumer.  All this at the speed of light in terms of logistics and products offering. On this base, Chromavis is building up its future by redefining its strategy, organization and culture, investing in a new Headquarter that will represent a “New Era” for Chromavis, with an outstanding futuristic project like never seen before in the colour cosmetic manufacturing sector."
Sillages Paris redefines perfume codes to seduce Millennials,"Maxime Garcia-Janin wants to create perfumes of our times. After a marketing experience at Giorgio Armani’s (L’Oréal) and Dior’s (LVMH), this young 27-year-old entrepreneur built his own project based on the sad discovery that people were disenchanted with perfumes, in particular young people. “In only five years, 1.4 million people stopped buying perfume through the selective channel and the market became standardized. People feel less pleasure when they buy perfumes now, and neither advice nor experience provide any added value anymore. The digital revolution is a real opportunity to reach people again, in particular young people, who have no problem with online shopping, as can be seen with makeup or fashion… Why not with perfume?” asks Maxime Garcia-Janin. Sillages Paris stands out with a novel, high-end perfume personalization offering online. “I wanted everyone to be able to create a perfume that would best suit and correspond to them, and which would contain the beautiful, natural, sustainable ingredients of high perfumery,” he adds. The principle is simple and quick. Thanks to an algorithm, the user selects six ingredients from a suggested list, which leads them to the formulas developed by four “new generation” perfumer-creators: Amélie Jacquin (Givaudan), Alex Lee (Mane), Mylène Alran (Robertet) and Sébastien Plan. The algorithm only suggests combinations validated by these perfumers. “It is a highly fast and playful solution that can be used in micro-moments, like when you queuing at the supermarket. At the same time, the emphasis on ingredients educates people to perfumery,” explains Maxime Garcia-Janin. Once the women’s, men’s, or unisex fragrance has been determined, several choices are suggested: you order either the bottle delivered with its testing sample, or the three-sample box containing the perfume selected and two similar ones. Both choices are affordable: EUR12 for the sample box, EUR83 for the 50 ml bottle. Shipping and returns are free and 100% reimbursed if consumers are not satisfied. “There is absolutely nothing that prevents returns, that is important,” the creator adds. Sillages Paris will launch a new travel-size, 15 ml bottle in March for EUR27. The perfumes are handmade on request in the brand’s Parisian workshops. Drawn by designer Pierre Katz, the bottle is featured in an original plant-derived polystyrene case manufactured by a company specialized in recycling. Launched last November and exclusively promoted on Instagram, in particular by influencers, the brand seems to be reaching its public. “After only two months, we got more than 500 customers and 4,500 followers on Instagram. The buzz has started, even with older people, despite our off-beat tone,” Maxime Garcia-Janin comments. Of course, Maxime Garcia-Janin has further ambitions. New formulas will soon be added to the algorithm. “The idea is to regularly release new compositions to offer more choices,” he adds. The brand was meant to get global from the very beginning. They should also focus on the American market, the land of Instagram!"
Sephora rolls out its new generation of connected stores,"Implemented in France and in some European countries since the beginning of 2017, the ""New Sephora Experience"" concept, based on services and connected beauty, is no available in Paris at the Saint-Lazare railway station. With an area of 840m2, this new specially designed store proposes all the services associated with this concept and takes the experience one step further with new in-store areas. In times of e-shopping and social networks, Sephora is banking on the complementarity between e-commerce and brick and mortar stores. An approach that required the introduction of new digital and physical services, often 100% personalized. The Beauty Hub is undoubtedly the most telling example of this renewal. This service enables accessing, via iPads, to a virtual lookbook to find ideas and get inspired by new trends, test virtually beauty looks via the ""Virtual Artist"", find the foundation color matching your natural skin tone with the ""Color Profile"", or to share one’s looks and favorites with the beauty community thanks to the ""Beauty Board"". Mixing the codes of the Sephora universe with an urban architecture (concrete, raw ceiling), the Saint-Lazare ""New Sephora Experience"" store also offers new areas and new services. Customers can now discover a ""Mini Skincare Market"" with skincare products in a travel format and various low-price kits to test brands, and also a new display entirely dedicated to ""Super Ingredients"". A ""Sephora Collection Mask Bar"" was also given pride of place in the store for customers to enjoy an express application when purchasing a Sephora mask for the face, the feet, the hands, the lips or the eye area. Along the same vein, the retail brand also proposes to visit the ""Amika Styling Bar"" to experiment a hair care or a brushing with the brand products. Sephora also proposes its complimentary engraving service, which allows personalizing a perfume bottle, a makeup palette or a lipstick."

Lush champions transgender rights with a new campaign (and a bath melt),"Shoppers can support the cause by purchasing the brand’s new limited-edition bath melt ""Inner Truth"", which will have 100% of its sales directed to organizations that support the trans community in North America. Containing fair trade organic cocoa butter and uplifting orange oil, the melt promises to soften and moisturize skin when added to a hot bath. Throughout the duration of the campaign, the brand’s North American store windows will be stripped free of products and decorated with screens showing quotes from its own transgender and non-binary staff members. It has also launched an online platform full of resources for the trans community and anyone else to learn about how to be a good ""ally."" The move is the latest indication that the beauty and fashion industries are waking up to the need for greater diversification when it comes to transgender representatives. Major brands such as L’Oréal Paris, which included transgender model and trans rights activist Hari Nef in its ""Your Skin, Your Story"" campaign last January and later briefly hired transgender model Munroe Bergdorf to star in its #allworthit campaign, has made an effort to be a part of the conversation. The relationship with Bergdorf was ill-fated, but she was later snapped up by rival brand Illamasqua to front a seasonal campaign. Meanwhile, last December saw the launch of unisex makeup brand Jecca, which was designed with transgender women in mind, while Valentina Sampaio became the first transgender model to land a French magazine cover when she posed for Vogue Paris’s March issue.

"""Our wish is to continue investing in France"" Edouard Macquart-Moulin, Natura Brasil","Premium Beauty News - Have your objectives changed for the French market? Edouard Macquart-Moulin - They haven’t changed. The objectives of Natura Brasil are based on three pillars: economic development and societal and environmental commitments. Whatever the distribution channel, direct sales, own stores or through partnerships, the important thing for us is to be profitable and to express our values in terms of sustainable and societal development. Premium Beauty News - Why did you put an end to your direct sales operation in the country? Edouard Macquart-Moulin - With more than 1000 beauty consultants loyal to the brand, believe me, it was not with a light heart that we made the decision in December 2016. This is an important channel for Natura Brasil but the market did not enable us to balance the economic pillar. However, the wish of our founders and shareholders is to stay in France and continue to invest. Premium Beauty News - What will be your new strategy? Edouard Macquart-Moulin - Our strategy is to develop a network of own stores. We already have a store in the Marais, and we also inaugurated last December a second store in the 4 Temps shopping centre in Paris - La Défense. On February 9th we will open a third store in the Vélizy 2 shopping centre in the south of Paris. In the course of the year we will continue to study opportunities for the opening of additional stores, in the Paris region or in French provinces. A lot of consumers who have known Natura Brasil through their beauty consultants are now waiting to find a store next to their home. Meanwhile, we are developing partnerships with French retailers such as Monoprix, Le Printemps and Birchbox, through on- and off-line sales. Premium Beauty News - You kept your e-store? Edouard Macquart-Moulin - Yes, it is still very successful. We are focusing on an integrated channel approach. Nowadays, every consumer is recognized, whether in a point of sales or on the internet. Premium Beauty News - Hence, these new stores will be the windows of Natura Brasil, how do you describe them? Edouard Macquart-Moulin - They are an invitation to discover Brazil in a 40 to 50 m² concept, which allows the customer to feel the warmth of the country and all the values of Natura Brasil, with a lot of natural raw materials, wood, plants, ingredients, a sensory experience. As for products, we have a portfolio of a hundred references for the body, hair and face and babies. Premium Beauty News - Your Group recently acquired the retail brand The Body Shop, will you develop a common strategy? Edouard Macquart-Moulin - We obviously share the same vision, which is of working and participating in creating a better world. But like what was done with AESOP, the two brands will continue to operate separately from a marketing and sales point of view to preserve their own identities. On the other hand, even if it is a bit too early to talk about it, there is obviously an industrial strategy of optimization. Thanks to this partnership, The Body Shop will be able to access, for example, to the sourcing of raw materials from South America, Amazonia. There will be synergies wherever possible in terms of infrastructure and logistics. Premium Beauty News - Are you looking to expand your foothold in Europe? Edouard Macquart-Moulin - At the international level, the Group aims to be present in 70 countries in the next ten years with its own stores and direct sales for certain locations. We will take advantage of the global presence of The Body Shop to establish ourselves in some cities. Today, we are present in most South American countries, in Mexico and we have two stores in New York, which represents twenty countries to date. In Europe, in addition to French speaking countries, we are looking primarily at Germany and the UK. A partnership has already been established with the online sales site Feelunique, which distributes our products in the UK with very encouraging first results."

"Scent O2, a new player in Europe in the alternative perfume circuit","Born from a common passion for authenticity and quality in alternative perfumery, the Scent O2 Company brings together the expertise of Johann Vitrey, who is the founding Manager of Sesame by JV, a distributor of niche perfume brands for the Middle East and Africa, and Anne Claire Kraft, won over by the emotional world of perfumes after a corporate career. ""I’m madly in love with perfumes. They reinforce the beauty of a breath and transform it from a physical necessity to pure aestheticism. They remind us that we are alive,"" she commented. The five dioxygen molecules in the Company logo illustrate the five activities roll out in five territories. Scent O2 will thus manage distribution, consulting, training, retail and management activities of own brands in five European areas: – Benelux,
– Germany,
– Austria and Switzerland,
– Italy, Spain & Portugal, France,
– and UK. Alongside the own brand of candles Promenade à Auvers, it already groups a dozen promising names in niche perfumery, all of them with a complementary story and positioning, among which, Sous Le Manteau, launched in February 2017. ""It’s a true conceptual brand that reconnects to the very essence of the fragrance, sensuality, seduction, with no compromise and with a ’brand’ signature that goes beyond juices. Fragrances are inspired by nineteenth century aphrodisiac elixirs with their mysterious, spicy and animal notes,"" detailed Anne Claire Kraft. The portfolio also includes a heritage brand still kept secret, and the private collection of the Spanish Master Perfumer Rosendo Mateu, and a brand with an oriental positioning."
Online Sales: Beauté Privée exceeds forecasts,"""We indeed had expected strong growth but the increase was much higher than what we had imagined, especially in the last quarter. Our order volume has increased by 100% compared to the previous year,"" commented Xavier Chauvin, CEO and co-founder of the site. The Head of the Company sees in this fine performance a real shift in consumption habits, stimulated by the increasing use of digital technologies, the ease of use of devices and the search for new brands and beauty trends. ""Which places us as the first pure player in Beauty,"" he added. A leading edge, which was reached thanks to identified levers that proved to be highly efficient. The site has maintained its momentum with new alternative brands. They now represent 30% of the offer, estimated to 1300 brand partners, including 300 newcomers in 2017. ""Expectations are really high for these new brands that we are promoting in an interesting way on social networks,"" detailed Xavier Chauvin. The second growth impetus comes from mobile phones (tablets excluded), which currently accounted for 80% of total traffic, thus representing a 150% sales increase. ""In the sphere of mobile applications alone, our growth is of 300%. Which means these behaviours are now fully adopted,"" added the CEO. For the year alone, more than 1.5 million new members were recruited by the site, which currently has about 4 million members. This is a result of the innovative work achieved in terms of communication, especially on the key notion of ’real time’. ""Along with sending the appropriate personalized message, we added timely sending: when the user is active and captive, using his app, and this whatever the media. This enables us new transformation performances"", explained Xavier Chauvin. To complement this positive picture, the rapprochement with the online site Showroom privé, early 2017, has enabled us to increase the volume of devices available, propose comprehensive solutions to brands (sales, media device, piggy back inserts, customer knowledge...), in short, to structure our growth. ""Being backed by Showroomprivé enables us to share best practices and to have a more trouble-free ramp up"" confirmed Xavier Chauvin."
Nuxe elects Tmall to set up in China,"Allowing foreign brands to sell products in China without bearing the burden of costs and administrative duties of a physical location, cross border BtoC e-commerce has experienced significant growth over the past few years in China, which should count 74 million of cross border shoppers in 2018, according to iiMediaresearch. Supported by Chinese authorities which see e-commerce as a tool to foster national consumption at the expense of purchases made by Chinese tourists abroad, the procedure is yet highly regulated. For instance, Alibaba requires brands to resort to a TP or “Tmall Partner” based in China to make the link with the platform. Nuxe has thus partnered with NextBeauty, a company founded by Grégoire Grandchamp comprising a team of Chinese experts formerly employed by L’Oréal China and Alibaba. “Don’t go thinking that platforms will do the job for brands”, he asserts. “Our role is to understand how to collaborate with brands and to develop a sales and marketing strategy to make them succeed on Tmall”. To attract the largest possible number of Chinese internet users, the TP encourages brands to make good use of the Tmall agenda which revolves around 6 major promotional events, notably Singles’ Day on November 11th or “11/11”, an online 24-hour shopping day launched in 2009 by Alibaba. In 2017, the Chinese giant announced a sales record of US$25.3 billion, a 39% increase over 2016, made at 90% through the mobile app – but also claims another victory, i.e. a move upmarket and a strong improvement of its brand image compared to the promotional sales events from its early beginning. The main innovation of the Tmall platform lies in the opening of a Luxury Pavillon dedicated to luxury brands, where Guerlain managed to sell a perfume at the price of 500.000 yuans (EUR65.000). Cosmetics brands did not skimp on resources. Lancôme invited six Chinese celebrities to introduce its products from different perspectives. SKII designed a limited edition presented in a joyful and playful way. MAC made 200 models parade at the “See Now Buy Now” show organised by Tmall. Estée Lauder, L’Oréal and Shisheido installed pop-up stores during the time of the event… “11/11 gains momentum through the integration of new codes such as premiumisation, customization, gaming and entertainment”, recaps Julie Bonnet. “11/11 is no longer a mere promotional event, but has become a major opportunity to bring together various brands, thus allowing us to combine branding and business.” Nuxe chose to feature three ranges of products - l’Huile prodigieuse, Rêve de miel and the Crème fraîche de beauté. “Preparation is what matters most”, insists Grégoire Grandchamp, who urges the need to begin planning six months ahead of the 11/11 event. Nuxe mainly focused on influencers, calling for a nationally-recognised KOL (Key Opinion Leader) expert in the field of cosmetics, Wu Miao (吴淼), as well as four regional celebrities coming from areas around Beijing, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Shanghai, “with the aim of attracting 2 million followers.” “Influencers play a critical role in today’s cosmetics”, asserts Grégoire Grandchamp. “Even brands which were originally little known in China like Leonor Greyl, whom we cooperate with, is currently expanding quite rapidly with the help of some KOLs.” However, he insists on the need to ensure that the influencers selected have a good knowledge of the brand and appreciate its products, “as a good influencer is someone who maintains a private and genuine relationship with the brand, who is a real fan. It is also important to establish long-lasting relationships with them, in order to avoid attracting fake followers.” For Julie Bonnet, influencers even “dominate the media landscape in China”. “Yet, there is one critical aspect that you must consider, especially as a French brand. Indeed, you must give influencers free rein if you want to succeed in China. You must let KOLs get insight-driven.” The outcome of 11/11 was “in line with Nuxe’s expectations, with 50 % of the sales turnover achieved for this first year which was rather short.” Brands usually achieve 35-40% over a normal year, indicates Grégoire Grandchamp, who assures that NextBeauty offers a long-term, balanced partnership between turnover and branding. “We give brands access to Alibaba’s data in English, to offer them a more targeted outreach in terms of customers profile and purchase trend”, he explains, adding that despite Tmall, NextBeauty regularly works with six or seven other platforms. To resort to cross-border e-commerce, brands are not obliged to go through Tmall. Other platforms exist, such as JD.com, which achieved a sales record of US$ 19.2 billion this year at 11/11 (a 50% increase in comparison with 2016), Xiaohongshu.com or even the leader Kaola.com (member of the Chinese group NetEase), less popular in Europe. “The landscape becomes more heterogeneous, more prolific and more complex”, indicates Laure de Carayon, organizer of China Connect. “These are interesting opportunities for those who are willing to look deeper into it.”"
"""We want to become the mass market leader for natural cosmetics"", Éric Renard, La Phocéenne de Cosmétique","Premium Beauty News - In 2016, on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of Le Petit Olivier, you had announced your intention to double your turnover by 2020, particularly by means of external growth. Here you are! Éric Renard - The Lovéa brand achieved EUR 11.5 million in sales, i.e., roughly half of the turnover of our brand Le Petit Olivier (EUR 22 million in 2016). This was quite a huge operation for a company our size. Our goal is to reach an overall turnover of EUR 50 million by 2020, thanks in particular to an increase in export sales. We are convinced that some significant synergies exist in this area between Lovéa and Le Petit Olivier. For 2018, we are targeting a turnover of EUR 35 to 38 million, which would make us the first French SME in the cosmetics sector operating in mass markets. On the other hand, we will remain focused on product development and marketing. The Laboratoires Biocos will continue to produce the Lovéa ranges in their dedicated production facilities, while diversifying their subcontracting activity for other customers. Premium Beauty News - What are the main synergies between Le Petit Olivier and Lovéa? Éric Renard - Both brands have a very complementary positioning. Le Petit Olivier is a brand with a traditional natural signature, deeply rooted in the Provençal universe. Lovéa is a young and exotic brand with an organic certification. It is the pioneering brand in supermarkets for organic certified sun care products, which enabled the Company to become the third market leader in this segment in France. The brand boasts exceptional expertise and legitimacy in sun care products, which is a major asset that we intend to fully preserve. But we believe that it also enjoys a strong legitimacy in other categories. We are going to start working on the development of other ranges, particularly shower gels and maybe deodorants, to be launched next year. The other exciting synergy concerns export sales. Lovéa achieves about 25% of its turnover abroad, vs. 28 to 29% for Le Petit Olivier. Our goal for the Group is to reach 33% in 2020. Le Petit Olivier is present in 64 countries against 38 for Lovéa. We have a very strong presence in some countries, like Russia, where the Lovéa brand is not present. We have also set foot in new markets in South America and Central America (Ecuador, Chile, Colombia) where the Lovéa brand is not active. Conversely, Lovéa has a strong foothold in the Netherlands and the Middle East (United Arab Emirates, Lebanon) where the brand Le Petit Olivier is not too present. In addition, we operate in similar distribution channels. Generally in supermarkets, drugstores and sometimes pharmacies. This will allow us to fully rely on our respective sales and distribution forces. Premium Beauty News - What are your strategic priorities? Éric Renard - We want Lovéa to become an exotic natural brand of reference in mass distribution, first by strengthening its presence in the sun care segment and then by consolidating and developing its positions in other categories. Furthermore, we want to build on the existing synergies between the two brands to develop sales in France, Europe (Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland), in Russia on the Mediterranean rim and more particularly Morocco and Tunisia. To this end, we are banking on the French know-how in cosmetics and on the recognition of Made in France products across the world. All our products are made in France, even if some raw materials like argan or monoï oil are obviously sourced abroad."
Certina Packaging France is born!,"Premium Beauty News - The common point to all these companies: the transformation of plastic materials by means of extrusion blow moulding, injection blow moulding and injection, to make all kinds of containers: bottles, jars, closures, etc. And, a speciality: cosmetics! Stéphane Perrollier - This is indeed the DNA of each company part of the Group with an extremely clear ""market positioning"": that of providing quality packagings, specific or standard, in quantities suiting every request and with maximum flexibility. The Rebhan, Herman Koch and Qualiform Companies are in this area, particularly complementary and the three of them enable to cater for the three segments in which they operate. This provides the market with a specialized group offering great agility. Premium Beauty News - And the dynamism of each of these companies cannot be denied! Stéphane Perrollier - This is certainly due to the enthusiasm driving the management and all the people who work for the group. All of them are highly invested today in this ""new adventure"". Each of the group’s entities understand the opportunity they are given to work alongside and share the same vision with clearly stated goals. Serving cosmetic and personal care brands for over 100 years, Hermann Koch offers its clients a wide selection of single- and thick-wall standard jars, sticks, roll-ons. All these made in Germany products can be combined with many different closures. From elegant standard components to luxurious customized works of art, Qualiform provides international beauty brands, packaging solutions that are designed in France and in the US, with a dedication to material innovation and performance. As a producer of cosmetic packaging solutions, Rebhan is the undisputed leader in the manufacture of Polymer Glass containers with also a wide selection of standard bottles and accessories. Premium Beauty News - In your case, you were more particularly in charge of Qualiform but you also recently created Certina Packaging France... Stéphane Perrollier - This is right. And in this context, I entrusted the management of Certina Packaging France to Vincent Gilbert, Group VP Sales for France. This new entity will allow us to roll out our strategy on the French cosmetics market. As for Qualiform, it is one of the most prestigious manufacturers of plastic bottles for the premium markets. Each year we produce millions of bottles for many international brands thanks to the commitment and enthusiasm of our teams based in Oyonnax, France. Premium Beauty News - A company that deserved to be expertly run! Stéphane Perrollier - Exactly! Our goal is to increase the investments, of course, not only in equipment, but also in women and men. On the industrial front, the previous group in charge had very cleverly invested in a raw materials autonomous management platform and in blow moulding. For our part, we have decided this year to dedicate a significant share of our turnover (12%) in industrial investments with, in particular, the installation of control cameras on our five screen printing lines.  This technological shift is obviously very positive for the teams who previously were in charge of performing these controls and who now are entrusted with a new role in the management of the line. Note that we have also invested in a new eight-cavity extrusion blow moulding machine to better meet the needs of our customers during key product launches. Premium Beauty News - Is the environment a strong axis?  Stéphane Perrollier - Yes, very strong and, as you can see with this raw materials management platform, we have an edge. Our commitment towards environment is also part of our DNA. We are convinced that the best way to respect the environment is to be vigilant and proactive by constantly seeking opportunities for improvements in our processes and by instilling in our teams a respectful and responsible attitude towards the planet. With this aim in mind, we have audits carried out to control our CO2 emissions. When they ask for it, we can provide our customers with a detailed summary for each of the projects we are working on. Hence, our customers can clearly visualize the efforts made to reduce CO2 emissions and thus contribute to the sustainability of their bottles. Each bottle design on which we work, must meet our quality control requirements, and must also undergo a series of tests directly related to their environmental impact and sustainability. In this context, we offer our customers the possibility of using eco-friendly plastic materials. We are convinced that environment protection is also a state of mind. Our premises have been optimized to be more energy efficient. As a company, we have agreed to invest almost exclusively in the appropriate equipment and infrastructures to reduce the environmental impact (fully electric production machines, LED lighting, optimized heating/cooling systems in offices). Premium Beauty News - In terms of market segments, you are positioned in skincare but also in make-up and scented derivatives... Stéphane Perrollier - We are indeed very present in these markets. Make-up is a segment to which we are paying a lot of attention. We are currently developing a new highly innovative project whose launch will take place in 2018. We also have a development policy for our range of standard product, a field in which Rebhan is particularly successful. You could check out their novel range, ""New Square"", made of Polymer Glass on our site www.certinapackaging.com"
Feelunique reports record Christmas sales,"Feelunique recorded strong trading in both the UK and internationally, and the company announced to on-track to reach approximately £100 million (about EUR 112,7 million) in retail sales for the 2017 calendar year. This announcement comes in the wake of the strong trading Feelunique experienced during the Black Friday promotion period. In the UK, retail sales were up 19% year-on-year to £7.4 million; while Christmas trading period retail sales in both China and France doubled. Feelunique’s performance was up against all KPIs, with average order values growing by 12 per cent, and nearly 1 million products shipped to 88 countries in the Christmas trading period. According to the retailer, the 12 Days of Beauty’ Christmas calendar was a best-seller, with eye shadow palettes also featuring strongly this year. UK best sellers included: Urban Decay Naked Heat Eyeshadow Palette; the GHD IV styler; Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair and Victor & Rolf Flowerbomb perfume. Top selling brands included Charlotte Tilbury, Chanel, Anastasia Beverley Hills, Urban Decay, Bare Minerals, YSL and Benefit, with Charlotte Tilbury’s Matte Revolution Walk of Shame lipstick being the best-selling product globally. “I am delighted with our record-breaking performance over the Christmas period, which further evidences our ability to capitalise on the consumer shift in the beauty market to online purchasing. We also remain on-track to reach £100 million in retail sales for the calendar year, which is a significant milestone for the business. Looking ahead to 2018, we will continue to grow market share in existing markets, with the scope to add further territories to our offering as a truly cross-border retailer. We will also be announcing the additions of several exciting new brands to the site early in the new year, solidifying Feelunique’s position as Europe’s leading online beauty retailer,” said Joel Palix, CEO of Feelunique. Founded in 2005, Feelunique is a cross-border online beauty retailer, shipping to over 120 countries and with dedicated websites in the UK, France, the EU, Germany, Norway, China and the US.  The company offers a choice of more than 30,000 products and 500 brands across makeup, skincare, haircare, fragrance and electricals. Feelunique claims over 130,000 site visits and more than 15,000 products sold every day, with 65% of sales coming from customers under the age of 35. It remains to be seen if the Boxing Days promotion period will be as profitable for Feelunique, but there is no reason for the trend to reverse."
Personalised products and bespoke services: The new luxury according to L’Oréal,"While the luxury cosmetics market is growing fast, it is also undergoing deepseated changes. “Boosted by digital, the arrival of new generations of customers and Chinese consumption, the luxury market is growing faster than ever. At the same time, it is forcing brands to reinvent themselves constantly”, says Nicolas Hieronimus, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of L’Oréal. According to Hieronimus, two new luxury markets are in the process of emerging. First, a market for affordable, accessible luxury whose swift growth is being driven by Gen Yers and Gen Zers around the world. The second market offers a high-premium, more experiential form of luxury reserved for connoisseurs, which crystallizes especially around ultra-premium skincare and niche perfumery. In this setting, L’Oréal Luxury has two priorities: “We’ve got to digitalise and diversify to meet consumers’ new expectations.” For L’Oréal Luxury, digital is both a great way to know consumers better and a fast-growing distribution channel.  “By harnessing data, social media, CRM and precision marketing, we can reach out to consumers in a pretty targeted way,” explains Nicolas Hieronimus.  Through these precision marketing efforts, the Luxury Division gathers key data on consumers, which it uses to identify specific expectations. Diversification-wise, L’Oréal Luxury is broadening and strengthening its brand portfolio to meet the many and varied needs of new consumer populations with perennial brands such as Lancôme, designer brands such as YSL and Giorgio Armani, and alternative brands like Kiehl’s and Atelier Cologne, or Urban Decay and It Cosmetics in the makeup category. As Nicolas Hieronimus sees it, the critical challenge for high-end brands is to offer consumers unforgettable experiences. To achieve this goal, the Luxury Division is counting on personalisation. A growing number of L’Oréal Luxury brands are now offering bespoke products, such as Yves Saint Laurent, which lets clients customise their lipstick by picking a colour, cap or by having a message engraved, to make it a unique object that can be offered as a gift or kept. Lancôme, meanwhile, recently began offering Le Teint Particulier, a new custom-made foundation that can be tailored to any skin type.  “In store, a beauty advisor scans and analyses the customer’s skin. The customer can then watch as a unique formula is prepared specifically for her.” A technological innovation designed to forge strong ties to the brand, but also “a huge operational challenge for the Group”, explains Thierry Cheval, head of Retail at L’Oréal.  “We’re talking about setting up micro-factories in public places, where they will be in contact with thousands of consumers. We can’t leave anything to chance.” Accordingly, two rounds of testing are conducted, comprising a first set of laboratory tests to verify the machines’ accuracy, performance and safety, and a second set at the sales outlets themselves to see whether the systems work properly in real-life conditions and over the long run. Thus, for the launch of Lancôme’s Teint Particulier in the USA, L’Oréal trialled the system at two stores on the West Coast before rolling it out at nine other US sales locations in the space of a year.  “Encouraged by our US success, we just launched this new service in France and now have 24 stores selling Le Teint Particulier on both sides of the Atlantic,” adds Thierry Cheval. The next step will be to roll out these services worldwide while developing new ones to make the customer experience even more special and memorable. “In the luxury market, it is crucial to give customers experiences. That is how we will continue to grow our online and in-store presence,” concludes Nicolas Hieronimus."
Intercos: What a year!,"Premium Beauty News - Your Group has certainly lived one of its most prosperous and, to say the least, eventful period, starting with its financial strengthening. Dario Ferrari - As you say in France, the planets are indeed well aligned for us! The equity participation of the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board, which has joined our other US financial partner, L Catterton Partners, enhances even more our potential to ensure our international development. Our first goal in the coming months is to successfully introduce the Group (IPO) on the Stock Market. Bearing in mind that, and this is important, the Company’s family background and control will remain unchanged. Premium Beauty News - Two major operations took place a few months apart: the joint venture with the Korean Group Shinsegae International Co. (SIC), and the takeover of Cosmint! Dario Ferrari - I must say I am particularly pleased to have been able to successfully achieve these two operations. They are of great importance for the development of our Group across all Beauty sectors in the world. The Italian company Cosmint, which was founded some 20 years ago and whose historic factory is located in Olgiate Comasco near Come, also has a cutting edge plant in Poland. This acquisition will enable us to strengthen ourselves considerably in the skincare, hair-care and body-care segments. But mostly, it will give us the possibility to increase our production areas by completely unclogging and reorganizing our current sites in Italy and specialise them by niche markets. With Cosmint’s additional turnover of 145 million euros, the Group’s turnover has now reached the 700 million euro mark. Note that the Masu family, the former owner, will continue, of course, to manage the company while M. Decio Masu will also be part of the Group’s Board of Directors. And, as a result, we are also setting foot in the perfume market, an also dynamic and very interesting sector to explore. Premium Beauty News - The second significant move was the completion last year, of the joint venture with the Korean Group Shinsegae International Co with the opening this year, of a production plant! Dario Ferrari - I must say that this was a great opportunity to seize. I always thought that an essential step in our conquest of the Asian market, and more particularly of the Chinese market, was to have a plant in South Korea. Innovation and quality, often associated with Korean productions in the area of beauty products, are indeed a vector of success. The search for novelty and perfection is really in the DNA of this people. No wonder why they are often called ""the Italians of Asia"". This can only bring us closer, right?! Don’t forget that we had already set up a R&D laboratory in this country. Knowing that the idea came from Mrs Chung Yoo-Kyung, President of the Cosmetics Department of the Shinsegae Group, the opportunity offered to bring to life in 2016 this joint venture with the Shinsegae Group was not to be missed. A joint venture which, as you know, is taking shape today with both the commissioning of a plant and of a Research Centre in Osan, in the Gyeonggi Province. A brand new factory, representing a 30 million dollar investment, built in just six months that covers an area of 15,000 m² and which is home to a hundred employees for the moment. Production, which has just started will focus on skincare and complexion products. Of course the whole team is Korean, with heading it, a man of experience, Mr. Jay Kim. Our goal for this unit is to reach 85 million dollars in sales by 2020. Premium Beauty News - Your foothold in Asia is therefore significantly strengthened! Dario Ferrari - All the more since we are also very satisfied with our industrial tool in China. To sum up, we have four factories, one of 50,000 m² and three others of 20,000 m2 each, not to mention a high-performance Innovation Centre. This year, our sales in this country will have increased twofold. Premium Beauty News - A word about the United States? Dario Ferrari - As you know, we already have a strong foothold there. But acquiring another company is still in the back of our minds."
"Gellé Frères, historic perfumes 2.0","In 1826, Jean-Baptiste and Augustin Gellé purchased a perfume store that belonged to Jean-Louis Gargeon, Marie-Antoinette’s perfumer in Versailles. Their perfumes and cosmetics were those of aristocrat and upper-middle class women in the 19th century, and then of icons in the early 20th. In 1945, the brand left the group of the Gellé heirs to turn towards more confidential herbal medicine and open a salon on Boulevard Haussmann. As he believed in the potential of this historic heritage, Simon Ménard took over the brand to put it back in tune with its time. “We started back from scratch and worked with historian Elisabeth de Feydeau to make the heritage DNA emerge,” explains the Director. Three great values emerged from this DNA and were brought up-to-date. Gellé Frères is the brand of queens – from Marie-Antoinette to entertainment queens Mistinguett and La Belle Otero, the first beauty icons. Now, Gellé Frères intend to target today’s queen, the hyper-connected “girl next door”, with a global digital approach. The Queen Index digital test “What queen are you?” to be filled in store or online offers to help every queen choose the best-suited perfume for them. The products have always been designed around flowers, and this world actually persists in the fragrance compositions. Every new perfume was developed by a perfumer and an olfacto-therapist to choose the flowers for their emotional benefits. “The idea is to make perfume become an emotional treatment,” says Simon Ménard. “To explain this emotion in store, we have associated it with music, by designing every one of the five fragrances listening to music. So, you can listen to your perfume.” Lastly, this brand has an innovation-oriented culture. The Gellé brothers were the first to use the hydro-distillation technique in the first steam plant located in Levallois, just west of Paris. Gellé Frères also innovated by adding glycerine to cosmetics for the first time. Today, innovation invites itself with a concept based on alcohol-free perfumes showcased in opaque bottles and formulated with the micro-encapsulation technique by Laboratoire TechnicoFlor. This more “natural” concept is especially popular in Asia, where the brand has high ambitions and was awarded the Organic Prize at the last Cosmoprof Asia show in Hong Kong. Already present in China with six 40m2 points of sale, they aim to develop in Japan and Korea with the support of their Chinese shareholders. France already counts a store on Avenue de L’Opéra, but the brand could soon inaugurate stands in department stores. “It took two years for the brand to develop until the store opened in March 2017, 19 Avenue de L’Opéra in Paris, just a short walking distance from where the Gellé brothers had opened their first store a century earlier. It is a global 4 to 5-million-euro project,” Simon Ménard reveals. The development of Gellé Frères is topped with an extension of product lines, mainly based on five fragrances and associated body care products. About sixty references will be added to the thirty existing ones. As for digital technologies, new experiences will soon be unveiled: customers coming to the store will be able to smell their perfume, while having a walk in mythical Parisian spots like Jardin du Luxembourg, thanks to a virtual helmet."
Oxygen Development acquires the Korean company Eyesome,"Oxygen Development, created some fifteen years ago continues to forge ahead. After moving into a state-of-the-art headquarters five years ago offering cutting edge equipment for R&D, formulation, manufacturing and filling of cosmetic products, the company closed its acquisition of 12-year-old Eyesome in November. “Eyesome along with our new skin care facility will allow us to bring Korean beauty and technology to our customers in a far more efficient manner than is available to them today. Beyond this we expect the transaction to greatly enhance our R&D capabilities given Eyesome’s alliances with Korean universities and focus on raw material development.” Scheduled to open in Q1 2018, Oxygen’s 140,000 square foot (13,000 sqm) new Florida-based skin care manufacturing will be equipped with the most modern Korean manufacturing equipment. “Oxygen is a global company today. We have people from 38 different countries who work at Oxygen. We will embrace these differences in cultures and perspectives, taking all the best practices from different regions of the world and encompass them into everything we do.” With the acquisition, last month, of the Korean Company Eyesome and by investing significantly in a new plant in South Florida, leaders at Oxygen Development are clearly demonstrating their strong will to be present in both the makeup and skincare niche. “Today, we already produce seven to eight million pieces in the skincare segment per year,” added officials. The integration of Eyesome and the new 140,000 square-foot  (13,000 sqm) plant in Florida will put a boost to this strategy."
Makeup: The Japanese group Nippon Shikizai in working order,"Premium Beauty News - A few words fist about your Group, its origin, its specialties and its development... Tsuyoshi Hasuo -  Nippon Shikizai began operating in the 1930s as a manufacturer of pigments for facial cosmetics and we are today one of Japan’s most innovative cosmetic and pharmaceutical suppliers in terms of R&D and manufacturing techniques. In addition to across-the-board manufacturing capabilities, overall quality control and an unparalleled commitment to research and development, we bring together under one roof, a unique group of specialists dedicated to providing cosmetic companies, worldwide, a complete business solution. Premium Beauty News - Your interest for France is not new? Tsuyoshi Hasuo - France is certainly one of the leading countries in the cosmetic field across the world where many cosmetic brands and world-renowned manufacturers have emerged from. The acquisition in 2000 of Thépenier Pharma Industrie (which was renamed Thépenier Pharma & cosmetics) was an excellent base enabling us to roll-out our strategy in Europe in the area of make-up. By taking over Thépenier, we were guaranteed to acquire a cutting edge production tool in terms of quality production and of compliance to standards at the best possible level. Requirements which are necessary in terms of pharmaceutical production enable us to develop ourselves with total serenity in the cosmetics sector. But we are also keeping an eye on the United States where this year nearly 20% of our turnover was achieved. Premium Beauty News - Seventeen years later, you have reached your goals! And you added a string to your bow by taking over Orléans Cosmetics! Tsuyoshi Hasuo - That’s right! You understood that we were patient. This acquisition of Orléans Cosmetics is also supported by major investments in Japan and, of course, in France. As for Japan, we are continuing to invest in our three factories and, more particularly, in the most recent one in Tsukuba, with a three-year investment programme of more than $ 25 million. This factory, which was commissioned in 2015, is capable of producing some 7 million units a year of cushion foundations and more than 10 million mascaras. We have invested a lot in hot filling. As you know we own a total of three factories in our country and a very large research laboratory where more than fifty people work. Over the last two years, our turnover in Japan has increased by more than 35%, the turnover of Thépenier Pharma by more than 45%. and that of Orléans Cosmetics, which we have just acquired, by more than 40%. The market is extremely dynamic. Premium Beauty News - What are the main assets of your Group in the current competitive environment? Tsuyoshi Hasuo - What our President, Kouji Okumura, had said in your columns in 2013 is still very actual: Our strategy is still based on four pillars: – We rely on creativity and technical expertise to provide exceptional products that can proudly bear the names of those who trust us.
– Our unwavering commitment to quality and our flexibility are the pillars of our business success. 
– We strive to be a major global player and the most innovative and respected cosmetics contract manufacturer.
– We seek to improve people’s lives with formulas that offer maximum sensory delight.
One of our strengths is undoubtedly our ability to innovate. Premium Beauty News - The takeover of Orléans Cosmetics also gives you additional advantages? Tsuyoshi Hasuo - Indeed, beyond the historical activity of liquid and pasty products manufactured by Thépenier Pharma & Cosmetics, this operation will enables Nippon Shikizai in France to extend its offer in the field of make-up. Like it already does on Asian and North American markets, with products made in Japan, it will now be able to offer cosmetic industry players operating in Europe, a full range of products and services designed and manufactured in France: Skincare (emulsions, lotions, gels), sunscreens, cosmetic powders, hot-poured products, high tech make-up pallets and scented derivatives. Finally, this merger will also benefit the optimization of our industrial organization in Europe, by enabling each site to refocus on its key know-how and to continuously develop the quality and originality of products offered by reinforcing and sectorizing the R&D teams of each structure. Thus, emulsions will be produced in Mortagne at Thépenier, while Orléans Cosmetics will be in charge of ""powders"" and hot poured products. Premium Beauty News - You also want to emphasize, rightly, on the benefits of this ""Franco-Japanese"" axis that makes your specificity today! Tsuyoshi Hasuo - Indeed I must insist on the fact that Nippon Shikizai is the only Asian subcontractor with production sites in Europe. This allows us to propose Asian market trends and innovations with a remarkable time-to-market, and what’s more, with the ""Made in France"" label! And that’s not all, our factory in Mortagne is FDA certified, it is one of the few in France, if not the only one, to be able to offer OTC products in the United States... this too, helps to make of Nippon Shikizaï a global player, up to the requirements of major international brands!"
Granado opens first store in Paris,"Opening their own store helped historic brand Granado - in association with Phebo, another historic Brazilian brand belonging to the same group - reassert their presence in Brazil starting from 2005 to highlight their heritage. “Few brands can boast the same story, it is important to have a store to put forward our origins. The brand’s identity depends on this,” explains Nazish Munchenbach, Marketing Director of Granado/Phebo. And the strategy proves successful, since the reborn brand now counts over 60 stores across Brazil. Supported by the Puig group, who took an equity stake a year ago, the Granado group has been enriching their lines, the latest being intended for babies’ sensitive skins, and has kept growing outside Brazil. As part of their global development, they confirm their affinity with the French public by inaugurating a flagship store Rue Bonaparte, in Paris, at the end of the year. “We came to Paris first thanks to the Bon Marché department store. It is here we get most recognition, there is a real emotional and cultural affinity between the two countries. It was actually logical and meaningful to really settle here before going elsewhere,” ensures Nazish Munchenbach. As a complement to the Bon Marché, with which specific and exclusive actions will be taken, the store will be decorated with the furniture found in Brazilian stores and spread across 70 m2 to offer most of the ranges signed by the two brands. The address chosen is located in the heart of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, and it benefits both from tourist and Parisian customers: according to the Director, it will help them test the brand’s consumer perception, apart from the department store. “This time, we will be in direct contact with French consumers, and that will help us understand their expectations and narrow our offering for them.” This new step towards Europe is completed with the opening of an e-shop, which has been accessible for a month, and other store projects are under study, in particular in Portugal. “Just like we did in Brazil, we will take time to consolidate and understand consumers’ interests. You can very quickly use and reuse a successful formula, but first, you need to find it. We actually have a very long-term project in mind,” Nazish Munchenbach promises. Granado Pharmácias

Italy: the Polo Cosmesi is in full swing,"This 2017 edition was characterized by the intervention of the President of the Polo of Cosmetics Matteo Moretti, determined to carry out what is now an aggregation of companies towards the birth of an extraterritorial cluster open to international markets. Objective shared with Lombardy Regional government and Municipality of Crema, the interlocutors present and with whom Moretti met on stage.  “Bond together to be competitive” was the leitmotif of the day. Formal engagement has come from the institutions. During the day, moments of entertainment alternated with training sessions, conferences and B2B meetings in a sparkling and informal atmosphere that promotes meetings between the various players in the industry such as suppliers of raw materials, robotic systems and intelligent sensors, strategic consultants, formulators and end users. The Polo Technologico della Cosmesi of Crema brings together 50 companies throughout the make-up production chain from formulation to packaging, from machinery to packing and filling industries (around Crema -just south-east of Milan- and which claims to produce more than 60% of the global selling of make-up), with 64 companies with more than 3,000 employees and a turnover of EUR 600 million to provide all the expertise needed to make the best make-up collections. Matteo Moretti, President of the Cosmetics Polo, has it all mapped out: “This year we have doubled the Innovation Day numbers and therefore, given the success and the results achieved, I can now anticipate that Innovation Day will come back next year.”"
"Claus Porto: revival through a new fragrance, Le Parfum","Over the 20th century, the Claus Porto family house gradually became part of Portugal’s cultural and historic heritage, thanks to their perfumes, but mostly their luxurious soaps carefully wrapped by hand in printed, coloured papers that left a strong impression and are still found all over the world. In 2015, the brand started afresh when the Brito family, who had directed the Ach Brito company for over a century (they also owned Ach.Brito and Confiança Lisboa, two brands specialized in toiletries and shaving products), sold the majority of the capital to an investment and risk capital company, Menlo Capital. A new team was put in place, led, among others, by artistic director Anne Margreet Honing and perfumer Lyn Harris, who creates the Miller Harris perfumes. Together, they endeavour to draw inspiration from the brand’s heritage to open it up to new horizons. “It is a great honour and responsibility to manage a company with such a history. Our job consists in making this heritage take on a new dimension and creating a new era for the brand,” reveals CEO Francisco Neto. To celebrate this adventure, the brand has launched a new fragrance for their 130th anniversary. “We are revisiting the brand through its exceptional DNA, and Le Parfum illustrates this approach with an exclusive strategy,” adds Francisco Neto. Claus Porto Le Parfum is an edition limited to 1,887 copies (1887 is the year the House was founded), and the series number is engraved by hand on every bottle. Through this exclusive approach, Claus Porto intends to reinforce their niche, lifestyle-oriented brand reputation. The juice was born between Lisbon and Porto. Anne Margreet Honing and Lyn Harris wished to convey the trip’s scents, emotions and encounters with citrus fruit, fig, and cedar wood notes. “This perfume evokes a break across Portugal, the discovery of its treasures,” explains Lyn Harris. Famous for their soap packaging, Claus Porto wanted a bottle that would live up to their fame. The artistic director plunged into the House’s archives and found inspiration in a bottle that dates back from the 1930s: they reinterpreted it by creating a smart, uncluttered bottle with curved, prominent lines, topped by a white cap, and featured in a white marble box. “Those that already know the brand will discover something new, and those that do not will discover a very delicate, unique fragrance,” claims Francisco Neto. Distributed overseas in independent perfume stores and department stores – Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman in New York, Liberty and Harrods in London, barber shops and concept stores – Claus Porto is also available in Paris, mainly at the Bon Marché department store, but also at Marie Antoinette’s, a perfume store in the Marais Quarter in central Paris. After opening wholly-owned stores in Lisbon and Porto, the brand is considering doing the same in big capitals like New York, Paris, Tokyo and London. “We like highlighting our luxury niche brand status. It is conveyed in packaging, raw materials, materials, prices, points of sale…,” the CEO concludes."
Strand Cosmetics Europe takes on a new dimension,"Decidedly, 2017 was a big year for Strand Cosmetics Europe!  Last February, the French company specialising in custom formulation manufacturing and filling of high-end skincare and make-up products opened an office in Brooklyn, New York City.  This Autumn, the company is completing the expansion works of its 12,800 m2 industrial site, which required an investment of 7 million euros and two years of work. ""Strand Cosmetics Europe is stepping up the challenge to become a leading manufacturer in its sector,"" said Éric Bouvier, General Manager, at the inauguration of the new site on October 26th.  ""Our project has been ambitious since the beginning. Our goal is to become a major player among the key subcontractors of international cosmetic brands and to provide our customers with an excellence-level service."" Strand Cosmetics Europe has chosen to transform its production site while maintaining the activity. The expansion of the facility allowed to improve the staff’s comfort and safety while implementing Good Manufacturing Practices similar to those of the pharmaceutical industry. The 4200 m2 additional space allowed the company to increase its production capacity but also to offer new services expected by its customers. ""Two years ago, with the exception of lipsticks, the company mainly supplied bulk to its customers. Today, our filling and packing business, including secondary packing, has expanded considerably. There is a strong demand for full service from customers,"" explains Éric Bouvier. Strand Cometics Europe now has 25 filling and packaging lines for tubes, jars, bottles and compacts and sheet masks, including a dozen lines which are fully automated. Innovation remains at the heart of the company’s DNA. The company employs around 30 staffs in R&D, of which 20 are in formulation and about ten in quality control. Each year, Strand Cosmetics Europe spends 5% of its turnover in innovation and has set up an advanced research unit to explore cutting-edge issues and new technologies and support projects with start-ups ... The skincare laboratory produces more than 200 new formulas per year, in response to requests from marketing or customers. About 20% of the time is allotted to the free creation of new textures and to meet and exchange with ingredients suppliers. ""Successful companies are those which, such as Strand, have the ability to constantly renew themselves and which are led by energetic and passionate teams. It is thanks to them that the cosmetics sector is France’s second net exporter,"" concluded Patrice O’Quin, President of the French federation of cosmetics manufacturers (FEBEA)."
Gotha Cosmetics: A brand new factory!,"Premium Beauty News - Gotha Cosmetics has made considerable investments  and your appointment coincides with the forthcoming relocation on a brand new site. Martin Breuer - That’s right! In exactly 16 weeks, the entire administrative team and production equipment and staff of Gotha Cosmetics will be relocated in this new site. A relocation that everyone has been waiting for a long time. We couldn’t stay any longer on the current site, which had become too small. This new location will of course enable us to be more efficient in all aspects and, more particularly, at the production level with a capacity increase of 100 %. In addition, we will have a dedicated OTC area, which will allow us to grow in this market segment, dedicated customer areas and a new showroom. Premium Beauty News - You just took office. A few words about yourself and your personal path. Martin Breuer - I have been in the beauty sector for the last sevn years. Prior to joining Gotha Cosmetics, I covered the role of CEO of Intercos Asia Pacific, before I was CFO of the Intercos Group. Premium Beauty News - Could you please recall the story of Gotha Cosmetics. Martin Breuer - Gotha Cosmetics Srl was founded in 2005 as a private label cosmetics manufacturing company. The Company is located in the province of Bergamo, near Milan, the capital of Italian fashion.  Its story began 20 years ago as a high-end skincare company, and then, in 2005, it transitioned into cosmetics with a vision of becoming a global point of reference in colour. Being a worldwide company, Gotha has three different locations to offer to its clients: its headquarters, located in Italy, are fully operational and this is where it produces all of its finest quality and highly innovative products.  Gotha also has two different locations in the United States which provide points of reference for all East and West Coast clients. These locations are used to conduct private and personalized presentations as well as showcase new product collections. Premium Beauty News - How would you characterize the product positioning of Gotha Cosmetics? Martin Breuer - Striving to incorporate the benefits of skin care products in cosmetics, Gotha has pioneered a new concept which is known today as ""colorceuticals"" or ""cosmeceauticals."" This has enabled Gotha to create high end technology emulsions giving it the reputation it has today: a standard and trend setter in emulsions from quality to innovation, performance and appeal. As time passed Gotha began to grow in all categories, mastering the art of creating primers, lipsticks, lip glosses, powders, hot pours and mascaras, while always keeping its skin care technology at the forefront.  Colours are our inspiration: now as well as the future, we continue to be inspired by pure creativity imaging to be cutting edge and will weave the possible and impossible through ongoing research. Realizing that a make-up product is more than a mix of thousand different ingredients, Gotha strives to combine long standing knowledge, sincere passion, tireless dedication and not a little fantasy, to transform your cosmetics dream into real life!  As the fingertip is unique to the person, we hope our customers will find their signature style in all Gotha creations. We serve customers that require bulk-only, semi-turnkey, and full turnkey orders. Whether the product is prestige, specialty, mass or OTC, we take products from initial inspiration to final execution. Premium Beauty News - Your vision?  Martin Breuer - The next important steps ahead will be to further globalize the Company. Thanks to the teams’ work, we currently have a leading position in the US market, especially among the Indie brands. Today, they represent an important portion of our business. This is normal, as we offered them the quantities and the proximity service they were expecting, not to mention quality of course, which remains a core element of our offer. Moreover, we are quite proud of being the suppliers of very big blockbuster in the United States. Now it is time to increase further our influence also in the rest of the world, with main focus on Europe and Asia."
LVMH combines luxury and sustainable commitment with Cha Ling,"The idea came to Guerlain’s President & CEO Laurent Boillot five years ago, when he travelled to the Chinese province of Yunnan, tea’s original birthplace. Moved by the beauty and richness of the biodiversity of the Xishuangbanna forest, an ecosystem threatened by deforestation, he decided to engage with biologist Josef Margraf and his wife Minguo-Li to save this ancient heritage sheltering highly venerated Pu’Er tea. To this aim, he chose to create a brand based on this precious ingredient endowed with a strong antioxidant power, and to use part of the revenues to reforest the place as it was originally, with a diversified ecosystem. Just like wine, Pu’Er tea has the specificity of improving with time. It peacefully matures in a cellar for decades, which makes its phytochemical profile gradually change. Beyond its strong antioxidant power, as it ages, it develops complementary molecules with an anti-aging action. Starting with these elements, the LVMH laboratories worked for three years to select the trees to harvest and develop formulas containing two types of tea – fresh tea harvested every year and tea that is at least four years old. “The products were developed following sustainable development principles, with a strict formulation charter, no parabens, no sulphates, and no silicones, although there is a strong sensorial level,” Élodie Sebag asserts. The formulas are composed of 85% to 99% green ingredients, the weight and volume of glass packs are reduced by 25%, and there is no external packaging: instead, there is a solution inspired from Furoshiki, a traditional Japanese technique for cloth packaging. Creams, and soon fluids will also be featured in ceramic containers made by hand in Limoges, France, for a refillable version. “We have sponsored the Tea Garden project in Yunnan, and we have already replanted more than 100,000 tea trees so far,” Élodie Sebag adds. Although all products are made in the Guerlain plant in St Jean de Braye, France, Cha Ling was intended to be globally positioned as a French-Chinese brand. “Very early on, we expressed the will, and that was important, to fully integrate the Chinese culture as soon as the development phase, and not just use the ingredient,” explains the CEO. The range integrates both skincare and rituals derived from traditional Chinese medicine for the application gesture, and of course, there is a whole environment around the ceremony of organic-certified Pu’Er tea (mugs, ceramic teapot). Launched in January 2016 simultaneously in France, at the Bon Marché department store, in Hong Kong, with a wholly-owned store, and on an e-shop, Cha Ling was then established in Shanghai in July, with a new store. Little by little, the brand gains fame with a targeted digital strategy (Instagram, platforms, Birchbox…), as well as a programme supported by micro-influencers in the beauty and lifestyle industry. “After a year and a half, we have achieved over 20% repurchases in the three countries,” Élodie Sebag. “Cha Ling is at the crossroads of different trends: wellness, the return of traditional medicines, in particular the Chinese medicine, and of course, the green movement. It seduces different customer profiles with different arguments – the overall Chinese tradition spirit in France, and the ‘made in France’ know-how in China. Lastly, it offers the LVMH efficacy for a meaningful purchase,” she concludes."
Omnicos banks on the future with a brand-new production facility,"It only took a “small” year for this new tool to be operational. A real “tour de force” on the part of contractors and of the designer, Beppe Riboli, who was so far more specialised in buildings designed for trend clubs. As a result, the visitor entering the place is immediately struck by this very sleek structure with original and pure lines, surrounded by greenery and covered by 7,700 butterflies. The feeling is even stronger once the first glass doors are passed.  The building and the terrace embrace the secret garden hosting the unique 400 years old olive tree. Luminosity, sheer whiteness... there is undoubtedly a feeling of serenity in the atmosphere. It is going to become a “delightful place” in which to work! The 700 m2 of laboratories are made entirely of glass windows overlooking on the outside. Production workshops for the processing of powders or liquids are divided into self-operating boxes (with an over-pressurized air system to avoid contamination), a few steps away from a fully automated storage hall built by Toyota and which delivers the exact quantity of raw material in one of the 2,000 individual pallet boxes, the 100% plastic “Omnibox”. Everything has been carefully devised so that the 140 people who work there every day feel comfortable and happy: just like their own home. Cafeteria, fitness room, auditorium, the “osteria” for the clients and the private parking for the employees… The 8,700 m2 of buildings, including the production halls, are completely self-sufficient in terms of electricity consumption thanks to a geothermic system and 260KW photovoltaic panels placed on the roof. “Opening the doors of our ’new home’ is our way of thanking every employee and co-worker, but also our clients and suppliers who have trusted us along all these years, allowing us to grow and evolve through the work we have always done, and keep on doing with great passion and enthusiasm,” explains Manuela Guerrini, Commercial Director. “Welcoming you inside our company is also a sign of transparency and integrity: that results in two open-style laboratories, the ‘Diamante’ and the ‘Kepleroom’, the new advanced research lab, but also a clear and conscious attention to Sustainable Development and the search for zero impact, in every area of the facility (i.e., led lights, geothermal system, a photovoltaic unit and antibacterial resin and paint), as well as a commitment to reducing production waste,” she adds. Founded in 1998, the Italian firm whose turnover will exceed this year 25 million euros (compared to the 5 million achieved six years earlier!), 90% of which is exported. It specializes in the formulation and production of make-up products. “Over the years,” details Manuela Guerrini, “Omnicos went from simple product supplier to product influencer and is today ready to take a further step by investing more and more in R&D, making of innovation a master word and obtaining recognition from industry players: this is the way to go! Innovation is not about ideas. It’s about making ideas happen. To innovate doesn’t simply mean to create something new. Innovating means to think and realize something, which was inexistent until then and which meets the clients’ needs. This implies the ability to fully understand their demands and, above all, to anticipate.” On the commercial side, the Italian firm, which already has a strong foothold in Europe, has decided to intensify its efforts on the North American continent with the aim of increasing twofold its activity. To this end, a new commercial agent was appointed in the person of Odette Bohan. Odette will be based on the West Coast, but she will also ensure a commercial presence on the entire territory. “As for Asia,” added Manuela Guerrini, “it will be on the agenda in two years!” Another immediate - industrial - objective: invest in the production of pencils with the arrival this year of three additional machines."
NYX targets makeup artists and ‘makeup addicts’ in L’Oréal’s new venture in Brazil,"Created in 1999 in the U.S. by South Korean entrepreneur Toni Ko, NYX Professional Makeup has emerged as an alternative between premium and mass-market makeup brands, claiming to offer professional-standard products to suit every budget. Available in 70 countries around the world, the brand first landed in Brazil in 2007 and has recently been relaunched by the L’Oréal Group after its acquisition three years ago. “L’Oréal’s mission is to offer beauty for all. In order to turn this concept into reality, it is crucial that we make high quality products widely available, including makeup, a category that has grown rapidly in Brazil in recent years,” says Bianca Pi, director of NYX in Brazil. Accounting for 26.4% of L’Oréal’s current turnover, the makeup category - which already has brand Maybelline in its consumer products division – has become one of the beauty giant’s strategic priorities for the next years. As part of the NYX’s restructuring plan, L’Oréal closed the kiosks that were still in operation in Brazil, which totaled 30 points of sale at the peak of operations, and collected the products. In this new phase, the brand will operate only through its own stores, offering more than 1500 products out of the 3000 items available in NYX’s portfolio – all of which will be imported into Brazil. The brand’s first store opened its doors in July in Rio. “It’s hard to work with such a wide product mix within the limited space of a kiosk. The stores will follow standards that include size and window display, aiming to create an inspiring environment for customers,” says Pi. The new stores – which Pi compares to candy shops – will have at least 80m2, seven meters of shop windows, plenty of mirrors and makeup available for testing. “We want customers to feel free to express themselves through makeup,” says Pi. According to Bianca Pi, NYX has two main target audiences in Brazil: professional makeup artists and what she calls ‘makeup junkies’ – teenagers and young women who describe themselves as ‘addicted to makeup’. A survey conducted by Nielson found that despite the unfavorable economic scenario in Brazil, this cosmetic category actually gained more than 2 million new consumers in the last year. More than 60% of them are women between the ages of 19 and 25. Product prices range from from R$ 20 (lip liners) to R$ 150 (eye shadow palettes). “We know how costly it can be for a professional makeup artist to build their own makeup kit. That’s why we offer a wide range of prices to suit every budget, from students ready to build their first kit to experienced makeup artists, who will find a wide choice of textures, colors, tools and finishings to add to their kits,” says Pi. With the professional market in mind, NYX sponsored the 8th International Makeup Congress, held in São Paulo in September during the latest edition of Beauty Fair. In addition to having a stand at the event, the brand held discussions about makeup trends among its team members and guests, including drag queen Nina Codorna, winner of the 1st Face Awards Brazil, organized by NYX. By the end of this year, more of the brand’s stores will be opened in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. NYX also plans to launch its e-commerce platform, which is currently under research and will take into account the most sought-after products locally. “We’re confident that NYX will be a hit in Brazil,” concludes Bianca Pi."
"Toly, set to invest strongly in 2018 to address the rise of subcontracting needs","Premium Beauty News - ""Who does not take a step forward, takes a step backwards! A saying that you follow to the letter!  Andy Gatesy - What other choice do we have? Everything is going so quickly today in the Beauty sector. Just look at what is happening, in particular, in the make-up niche. Dozens of new brands emerge every year... You can hardly believe the sales figures of these new brands posting millions of pieces, most of them unknown a few months ago, and that take the marketplace by storm. Subcontracting needs continue to grow... You must accompany and even anticipate the market and its trends. Demand for innovation is increasing more and more. We spend more than 300,000 euros in patent filings every year. Our development strategy in ""Cushion"" compacts, although started late, is exceeding our expectations with a level of orders never reached before. Success is the same in Asia with our packagings equipped with a dropper. New businesses are emerging everywhere in the world, like recently in Colombia. Premium Beauty News - Clearly, your former business of ""mere"" packaging manufacturer is changing at great speed!
 
Andy Gatesy - To say the least! And we adapt ourselves as quickly as possible. Every day, I can only be satisfied with my decision of having set up a top-level Innovation Centre in Malta, which was the result of many years of research in new packagings and new applicators for the perfume and cosmetic industry. Clients can access some 800 models on display, try them, test them, and compare them. But that’s not all! We also hired a MakeUp Artist two years ago and a Beauty Blogger three years ago. Each month a real ""Trend Team"" works with our development, innovation and design teams. We have managed to dramatically shorten the creation and production lead-times: in some cases, we jumped from seven months to three weeks! ’We started by being an engineering company - Building moulds and converting plastics and when I became CEO 26 years ago we became a packaging supplier and now we are a Beauty Solutions provider."
Tecnocosmesi: A new plant and already ten months of production in Canada,"Premium Beauty News - A few words on your Company... Francesco Fausti - As you know, we are based near Milan in the town of Massalengo. I created the Company in 1979 and we are specialized in the manufacture of cosmetic products for the make-up and skincare sector with a specialisation for ""OTC products,"" which has contributed a lot to our reputation. And we work for the biggest international groups in the area. Premium Beauty News -This new plant in Canada is a ""first"" in more ways than one! Why Canada? Francesco Fausti - Yes, it’s true! This is the first time we will be producing out of Italy. But let me remind you that we also have an antenna in New York since 2014. Why Canada? The reason is simple. This country of course very close to the United States, which remains the largest market for cosmetics in North America. Canada, where European culture is strong, offers all guarantees of economic stability, both financial and socially. Connections between Montreal and Genoa, a port city an hour’s drive from Massalengo, are extremely frequent and simple. Canada has all the necessary skills in terms of specialized and qualified personnel. The city of Laval, which we chose to settle, is also twenty minutes from the Montreal airport. Finally, it is much easier to enter the U.S. market coming from Canada as part of the trade agreements that exist between the two countries than it would be coming from Europe. Premium Beauty News - A dew figures? Francesco Fausti - The new 6,000 m2 factory is built on a 20,000 m² of land and the first production phase began last November. A second phase related to an increase in capacity is planned for early 2019, followed by a third phase within five years. The objective in five years, ensure that the Group’s total turnover is equally divided between Europe and the United States. Premium Beauty News - What is the amount of the investment? How many people work there today and do they do? Francesco Fausti - In total, the envelope amounts to more than 13 million euros, this includes the construction of the plant itself and the equipments and machines. We currently employ a dozen people, but this figure should quickly jump to about fifty in the coming months. Actually our project has proved its worth since presently, that is to say halfway our current fiscal year (March to April), we are producing twice has more as what was expected. As for the products, they currently only concern pressed powders and assembled products but in the medium and long term we will offer the whole range of Tecnocosmesi products. Premium Beauty News - A few words on your historic plant in Italy... Francesco Fausti - Our growth is still as strong and we are continuing to increase our capacity. And don’t forget that we are certified ISO 22716:2007 (Good Manufacturing Practices - GMP) and that last year we obtained the ISO 14001 certification. Our reputation stands in a few words: ""Quality, Experience and Creativity"", but also ""Innovation and Research"", which allows us to always aim ""higher"" in terms of colour ranges and texture performances. Finally, I insist on this desire to offer products ""Made in Italy"" products."
Euromonitor on Natura’s acquisition of The Body Shop,"“Natura Cosmeticos acquiring The Body Shop makes sense in the context of Natura’s existing portfolio and its shared values,” comments Hannah Symons, beauty and personal care analyst at Euromonitor. For several years, Natura has been experimenting retail strategy through its small high-end brand Aesop.  “Upon purchasing Aesop in 2012, Natura has facilitated the sustained growth of the brand’s best-in-class, mono-brand retail strategy,” said Hannah Symons. Building on this experience, Natura opened its first own physical store in Sao Paulo in 2016, a radical move considering that direct-selling has historically strongly underpinned the company’s DNA. “This was a clear signal of a change in retail tack for the company, which is why the acquisition does not come as a surprise,” added Symons. In parallel, after having entered the Brazilian market in October 2013 with the acquisition of 51% of Emporio Body Store, The Body Shop had initiated an ambitious retail plan in Brazil.  However, with an e-commerce presence and 130 shops in Brazil, the actual situation of The Body Shop in the country remained far below its initial goals. According to Euromonitor, The Body Shop being a pioneer of ethical sourcing and social responsibility in the beauty and personal care industry, makes it a perfect match for Natura’s green approach to production and plant-based heritage. “These shared values will help nurture the defining integrity of The Body Shop on an even greater global stage. This comes at a crucial time when many consumers are redefining their priorities and ethical consumption is topping agendas,” commented Hannah Symons. While sharing common ethical values, the two companies are very different in their geographical presence. “Whilst the majority of The Body Shop’s 2016 sales came from developed markets, Natura’s strength lies in the emerging regions, account for 98% of its value in 2016. Undoubtedly this exposure will provide a necessary springboard for The Body Shop to expand further into valuable emerging territories to help revive growth. In this case the acquisition would be a happy marriage; reducing Natura’s reliance on Brazil, whilst mitigating The Body Shop’s risk in stagnating developed regions,” concludes Symons."
L’Occitane lets the sunshine in with new store design,"L’Occitane is rethinking the design of its stores in France and abroad by testing a new concept named ""Sunshine"". More than 40 boutiques in Europe, the United States, the Middle East, Asia and Russia will be fully renovated to comply with the new design. In France, the first Sunshine boutique opened its doors on September 4, avenue des Ternes, in the 17th arrondissement in Paris. ""In a globalized world where the role of technologies is getting increasingly predominant, the L’Occitane cosmetics group has chosen to bet on more authenticity and a solid grounding in reality,"" explains the company in a statement. The new concept resolutely opts for vivid colours and a warm lighting. The brand’s iconic yellow is now massively colouring the shop’s inner and outer walls, sublimated by a warm lighting coming down from the ceiling and from backlit furniture. The new colour code modernizes the brand’s image, while retaining the essential references to its Provençal origins. When entering into the shop, the visitor’s eye is not attracted by flat screens but by a large round washbasin, the so-called “Ice Breaker” zone, which is intended as a facilitator between customers and shop-assistants. This is very symbolic of L’Occitane’s choice to limit the visible footprint of digital technologies in its stores.  The company wants to put digital technologies ""at the service of the sensory experience and not the opposite"". Various dedicated areas (face skincare, men’s products, fragrances, gifts, etc.) invite customers to test the products within a calm and friendly environment, with the help of shop assistants who will use the tablets available in the boutiques only for specific requests. Nevertheless, the new shops are far from being cut off from the digital world. Actually, digitalis everywhere in the back office as well as in the organization of a click-and-collect service called “Pick in Store”: customers can order online before withdrawing their product in the shop of their choice, three hours later. Other ""Sunshine"" shops are expected to open in the coming months in France and the concept is also being tested since August in China and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region."
"“Just because you are demanding, does not mean you cannot be caring,” Isabelle Guyomarch, CCI Productions","Isabelle Guyomarch purchased CCI Productions in 2008. She managed to give new impetus to the company to preserve its future. Her business is focused on perfumes and cosmetics manufacturing for third parties, from the development to the packaging phase. Then, four years ago, she had to fight an aggressive breast cancer: that is when she realized how difficult it is to manage both an activity and a disease. “As a company director, I just could not stop working, and yet I was sick,” she explains. Through her career, she happened to meet many women like her, who also felt desperate because of their diseases and distressed to lose their jobs or not be able to get back to it. “After this hardship, I needed to make sense of something that was, well, nonsense. I felt like creating a different model in my company,” she claims. The day she met Anne-Sophie Tuszinsky - who has founded the company association Cancer@work - was decisive. Isabelle Guyomarch decided to set up an original CSR policy [1] within her own company. She created a training workshop in January 2017 to help people stay at work or make them get back to it after a long disease through flexible hours and work pace, as well as a considerate management. “When you are off for a long time, it is very stressful to get back to work – you are tired, things go fast, and it is hard to make contact with the others. This workshop helps gradually readapt to the world of work and reconnect with your social life and life as well,” she says. The project is intended for every profile and all sources of exclusion due to illness, and not just cancer. It has already showed positive results on the whole company. The overall absenteeism rate has declined. “It does not mean sick people work more, but their will and courage are seen as models by others,” explains Isabelle Guyomarch, who also observed a caring social climate in turn, as well as a certain pride of the employees in their company – 80% are women. These aspects corroborate the Director’s vision on her approach: make this societal project a positive, profitable element for the company. “I wanted to make it a strength, an opportunity, not a cost item full of constraints like most other companies do. You can earn money and still do good to your environment and measure the benefits of your actions,” she asserts. To her, wellness at work, the positive effects the company’s activity creates on her internal and external environment represent a management solution. The human parameter is at the core of the industrial group’s culture. “Beyond this experience, my strategy is also aimed to break taboos on cancer at work and breast cancer in particular. 50% of women lose their jobs three years after the disease. The less skilled can very quickly find themselves in a precarious situation,” adds Isabelle Guyomarch, who insists on the notion of societal project. She will share this message and others with CCI Productions customers at the official presentation of her action next October 19 – she will also announce her decision to sponsor the Cancer&Travail “Allo Alex” hotline. “Our relationship with our customers goes much beyond the quality of our products. These brands are also committed, and they really want the company with which they work to take care of their employees. Just because you are demanding, does not mean you cannot be caring – it is the combination of the two aspects that is innovative,” concludes Isabelle Guyomarch."
Beauty full service: The ambitions of the Swiss company Marvinpac!,"A few figures first... In 2016, Marvinpac had sales of 45 million Euros for a workforce of 250 people, 23 million co-packed units and 11 million co-manufactured units. Premium Beauty News - From where does Marvinpac originate? Vincent Isselin - At the start, this Swiss company, created in 1999, was specialized in cardboard processing. As part of a proactive and supportive approach to our clients, we expanded our areas of expertise to offer more and more services over the years. From contract packing to conditioning including the creation of packagings and the development of accessories, the Company gained momentum naturally. Historically, with customers operating mainly in the food sector (including the largest, the Nestlé Group and its flagship product Nespresso. Then new markets gradually opened up, with the Pharmacy and, of course, the Beauty sector in the broad sense and more particularly skincare. Thus in addition to the opportunity offered by this joint venture in 2016 with the Strand Cosmetics Europe Group, Marvinpac decided to step up a notch its development strategy across the cosmetic spectrum, including make-up. The creation of the French subsidiary is aimed at accompanying Beauty brands with our global solution dedicated to custom packaging. A trade in which we stand as key player in Europe. From custom packaging to design, manufacturing and management of accessories, to the production of rigid boxes, we are able to offer a turnkey service and premium quality throughout the value chain. Premium Beauty News - What does your offer consist of? Vincent Isselin - This is a high value-added service offering, with quality turnkey solutions, and an increasingly optimized ""time to market"". It is by relying on our purchasing organization, our project development department, our established partnerships with suppliers and our two industrial sites that we have been able, for years, to provide a service of excellence, ranging from pure co-packing operation to real full-service. In addition, all services are carried out in full compliance with the most stringent international standards in terms of quality, traceability and safety, thanks to a product quality supervised and guaranteed by a dedicated team in charge of the application of protocols and compatibility studies on behalf of its customers. 
By establishing ourselves in France, the world’s cradle for high-end and luxury products, we aim to accelerate our development on the cosmetics market, among others and get closer to international brands. As I said above, in the continuation of the development of our cosmetic activities initiated 5 years ago, strengthened by the creation of MS Swiss Cosmetics in 2016, France appears today as a natural destination for us.

BCM Cosmétique: as trendy as it gets,"For this 2017/2018 collection, BCM has identified three major trends that have inspired their latest innovations and launches for all cosmetic product categories. “Conversely, every BCM category expert also provided food for thought for the trend we had predefined, thanks to their product expertise, and we had a very fulfilling, multicultural discussion,” explains Marie-Christine Clerc, Sales & Marketing Director for the Face category. In addition, to assert the expression of their message, BCM developed an olfactory signature for every family, in collaboration with a perfume composition house. The first trend for this collection is named  Do It . It expresses strength and determination, girl power and self-confidence – a sort of can-do attitude, adds Marie-Christine Clerc. It corresponds to textures that hold their promises, are reassuring and long-lasting for high-performance products, and combine with vitality and energy notes, like tangerine, bergamot orange, and ginger. In the three makeup categories – Lips, Face, and Eyes – the Power Lips 2-in-1 provides a plumper effect on the lips and lip contour. Test results have shown this serum and lip makeup product guarantees a 50% enhanced hydration performance. Also, the vitamin-enriched Mini Outdoor Lipstick can withstand any sports activities. Anti-wrinkle makeup base Ready, Aim, Primer! removes both pores and fine lines. Power Blush, a long-lasting compact powder, contains pigments that can last even after the texture has disappeared. Ultimately, also long-lasting, the Eyebrow Pomade can play with the climate, while offering a very natural makeup result on the brows.  Be it  is the second family. It embodies diversity in benevolence, identity, ethics, tribe spirit… “It is intended for more committed women asserting their lifestyle,” Marie-Christine Clerc comments.  Be It  creations boast a fragrance profile that evokes indulgence with green fig and pepper notes. BCM completed the  Be It  trend with Enchanted Lipsticks, mauve, green, yellow, and blue lipsticks which provide the lips with a highly personalized, pinkish colour when they come in contact with the skin’s pH. Also following this trend, there is the astonishing Peel & Reveal Lip Mask, a moisturizing, coloured peel-off mask for the lips which, once the film removed, leaves the mouth naturally tinted and material-free for two hours. For the complexion, the Vegan Complexion Equalizer excludes all products of animal origin and, with the accuracy of a dropper or clic pen, adds and mixes a drop of colour-concentrated emulsion with a day cream or sun cream. “For consumers, the message in line with the trend is clearly: I am myself with my usual products and I do not need multiple creams,” explains Marie-Christine Clerc. BCM has also designed a Mineral Powder Foundation with mineral pigments, a natural powder which turns into cream on the skin for a radiant result. Here is another example, this time following the multi-mask micro-trend: BCM has developed a line composed of three masks based on natural ingredients to be used individually or combined with each other for a complete ritual – SOS Soothing Face Mask for sensitive and dehydrated skins, SOS Detox Face Mask for a purifying action with charcoal powder, and the leave-on 3 Minute Eraser Mask, with a fresh texture. Lastly, the  Feel It  trend embodies the holistic quest for wellness, nature preservation, and the right balance between the body and mind. “This movement has been trendy for quite long, and it keeps changing,” Marie-Christine Clerc asserts. The range offers products with sensorial textures for a clean finish. The olfactory notes convey oriental glamour, sensuality, and relief, thanks to tangerine, pepper, and lavender. These are contained in Overnight Sleep In Hair Oil, a silicone-free oil for hair ends, and Lip Nectar, an anti-aging lip treatment based on essential oils and vitamins. This was just an overview: this collection rich in texture and formulation innovations should get even broader at the next Luxe Pack Monaco show."
Walgreens Boots Alliance sells BCM to the Fareva Group,"Under the terms of the agreement, Fareva will take ownership of BCM, Walgreens Boots Alliance’s contract manufacturing business in the personal care sector.  Simultaneously, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Fareva have agreed on a 10-year global partnership for the manufacture and supply of Walgreens Boots Alliance own beauty brands and private label products, including products for sale in the USA. BCM, the contract manufacturing business of Walgreens Boots Alliance, is one of the largest health and beauty contract manufacturers in Western Europe.  The company operates factories in Nottingham in the UK, Vitré in France and Frankfurt in Germany. For its part, Fareva is a leading global subcontractor for the beauty and health markets. The group manufactures in 11 countries, including the USA, and has significant research and development capabilities. “The proposed agreement will create a partnership to provide Walgreens Boots Alliance with a core multinational manufacturing and development resource, enabling the company to accelerate its global product strategy,” explains Walgreens Boots Alliance in a release.

"“Augmented reality is a great tool to create desire and we’ll soon extend it to skin care”, Alice Chang, Perfect Corp","Premium Beauty News - The applications of the YouCam suite [1] are now among the most popular augmented reality apps for smartphones.  How did this idea emerge? Alice Chang - I used to work for CyberLink, our parent company, which is specialised in augmented reality and facial recognition technologies.  A few years ago, I realized that these technologies could be adapted in order to be used on smartphones which are a much more dynamic market than personal computers.  As smartphones were becoming more performant, we understood they would soon play a key role in everyone’s daily life. However, while smartphone had good cameras, the existing image editing tools were not adapted to the skyrocketing selfie trend.  When edited, selfies looked fake.  We wanted to improve the quality of selfies and to enable every woman to enhance her natural beauty, exactly what makeup is doing. This is why we launched YouCam Perfect, which was a huge success. The development of YouCam Makeup was the second step.  It was a natural development in order to help women to improve the quality of the pictures they send to their friends or publish on social media.  This second app was much more difficult to develop than the first one because we had to apply the makeup very precisely, with nice and accurate colours.  We therefore developed a colour blending technology so as the application be as realistic as possible. Thanks to this tool, the colour which is virtually applied will merge with the user’s skin tone and will look different on different faces… Furthermore, makeup application had to be accurate even if the user was moving its head.  Eventually, the success of this second app went well beyond our expectations. Premium Beauty News - Did you immediately understand you were changing the way consumers are testing products and thus disrupting the beauty industry? Alice Chang - It was exactly what we wanted to do.  However, at that very moment we had no idea of what would be the business model.  From the beginning, we decided that the two apps would be free for users, because in the new economy you first have to grow your size and get the biggest share of the market.  But we had no idea of what would be our income sources.  We just had the intuition that augmented reality had a huge potential on smartphones! As the YouCam Makeup app became increasingly popular among millennials, we started to make links with beauty brands and retailers.  And we had impressive results.  The more consumers try beauty products, the more interested they are in buying them.  Trying through the app is very similar than trying the real product, that’s the main asset of YouCam Makeup: it is realistic and there is no risk no constraints in trying a wide array of products and colours! We also developed tools so as users can try colour cosmetics in stores. Trying makeup products has always been difficult in stores, because of cost and sanitary issues. Now we provide a convenient and realistic solution. The beauty industry is now very familiar with augmented reality technologies and we strongly contributed to that. We are now discussing with a lot of brands and we recently signed a global contract with the L’Oréal Group.  It’s a win-win deal for brands or retailers, for users and for us. We have only two years but we developed very fast! Premium Beauty News - So far, augmented reality testing is focused on colour cosmetics, including nail colours. Do you think that new categories could be added? Alice Chang - In the wake of our agreement with L’Oréal we are working on new developments to enlarge the range of product categories that can be tested through our apps.  For instance, we’ll soon allow our users to test skin care products! The skin analytic care tool we’ll be added into the YouCam Makeup app and will be launched globally within a few weeks. It will identify skin imperfections, targeting five issues: skin tone, spot control, wrinkle resilience, texture refinement, dark circles.  The aim is to allow people to visualize how their skin is changing and improving with the use of skin care products, and also to provide them with advices. Furthermore, we are continuously improving the app. We’ll soon launch a new 3D simulation which will allow to be get even more realistic effects with makeup which will follow the face movements.  We’ll also add new features such as the possibility to try a large variety of accessories. Recently we launched live shows in North America including Mexico. This tool aims vloggers, bloggers and brand ambassadors to promote their preferred products and viewers can shop simultaneously. We continue to develop new tools, to innovate and to move forward. Augmented reality is a great tool to create desire for products and to help people understand what products could bring to them. Furthermore, the importance of mobile devices will continue to grow in our daily lives with a lot of new apps, including ours."
"“We have every reason to be optimistic”, Loïc Armand, Cosmetics Europe President","Premium Beauty News - What is your vision of the cosmetics market evolution? Loïc Armand - I have an extremely optimistic vision of it. The cosmetics market is the only one to have gone through the crisis without batting an eyelid. We meet basic needs, while offering affordable products. On the global level, our industry is driven by the rise in middle classes’ purchasing power: there is already a significant growth potential in Latin America, India, and South Asia. And in the future, we foresee a very strong growth in the demand for our products in Africa, which is definitely the new frontier for our industry. It is on this continent that future markets are developing. As for Europe, the tendency is positive, despite cyclical changes. It remains the first global market by far. In 2016, the cosmetics industry’s growth apart from the UK was evaluated at 1.2%, even if the turmoil in the currency markets following the Brexit vote compelled us to reduce it to +0.8%. Premium Beauty News - Talking about this, how will Brexit impact the European industry? Loïc Armand - The European industry cannot remain indifferent to the questions that emerged about Europe’s future. But if Brexit is an important issue that will need to be dealt with, it is not a major challenge for us. The real problem would have been Frexit, if France had got out of the European Union or euro area. From this standpoint, the French election result has made us much more optimistic. The French have elected the most Europhilic executive power and Parliament the country has ever had. The fact that Europe has recovered a dynamic economic growth should help meet citizens’ job expectations. In addition, the EU should make sure it provides satisfactory answers to security needs. Premium Beauty News – Is the UK still about to free itself from part of the European regulations? Loïc Armand - We will see what they actually decide to do. Right now, it is good form to criticize European regulations. Of course, they are not flawless, but we do think they are the most protective for consumers and the environment, and they still allow for companies to innovate. Since the first European Directive regulated our business in 1976, our industry has exchanged a lot with the authorities on these issues. European cosmetics regulations have become a reference point for many countries. As for us, we endeavour to support global convergence on their main principles: responsibility of the person that places products on the market, risk assessment, distinction between risk and hazard, etc. We have recently won several battles. That is how the Chinese government has taken over most of the principles of the best regulatory practices for their new regulations… It is the fruit of six years of exchanges and dialogue with local authorities. India is another example of this: recently, they were still one of the rare countries not to recognize the notion of inevitable traces of heavy metals. This anomaly was resolved by modifying the Indian Federal Law in December 2016, taking over the European regulations principles. Premium Beauty News - And yet, recently, European consumer associations were still criticizing the presence of allergens and suspected endocrine disruptors in cosmetics available on the European market. Loïc Armand - There is still a lot of misunderstanding as regards these issues. Consumer associations are not opponents, we need to exchange with them. But the difference between hazard and risk is still misunderstood. It is a real challenge for us."
Parfums de Marly enters the new Printemps de la Beauté department store with a redesigned concept,"No more off-beat Neo-Baroque atmosphere or allusions to the reign of King Louis XV! The niche perfume brand founded in 2009 by Julien Sprecher has redesigned their retail concept for a more classic, Haussmanian-inspired decoration created by designer Hubert de Malherbe. References to King Louis XV and his passion for horses will not disappear though – they will only get more sober. “We are creating a brand identity that is less marked and more accessible,” emphasizes Julien Sausset, CEO of Parfums de Marly. First, the new concept will be deployed in the brand’s future shop-in-shop (15m2) in Printemps Haussmann’s brand new Scent Room in Paris (opening planned on July 17, 2017), and then in the new 42m2 store to be inaugurated in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in February 2018, in the Dubai Mall Luxury extension. “The fact that we are entering the world’s largest concept store dedicated to the beauty experience is a step further in our development and visibility,” explains Julien Sausset about the brand’s entering the new Printemps Haussmann beauty section. In France, the brand already has a wholly-owned store in Paris, on Cambon Street, and it is also available in Cannes, at Taizo’s, and in Paris 8 Monaco high perfumery section. On the global level, Parfums de Marly is available in 48 countries and about 450 points of sale: at Harrods’ and Selfridges’ in London, in the United States, with a wholly-owned store opened in January 2016 in New York’s Meatpacking District, and at Bloomingdale’s, but also at Nordstrom’s in about fifty points of sale, and in Asia, in specialized multi-brand shops in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. To widen the audience, the brand will also develop the women’s offering. So far, Parfums de Marly offered a 22-juice collection (16 for men, 6 for women), and achieved over 60% of their sales with men’s/mixed perfumes. The brand has just launched a 23rd fragrance for women, Delina, with a floral note dominated by Turkish rose, but also lily of the valley and peony scents. “It had a dazzling success from the very beginning, as 80 items were marketed in the first weekend at Selfridges’ in London, and as many at Beymen’s in Istanbul, over the same period,” Julien Sausset rejoices. As sales have risen by 48% in Europe and more than 60% in the United States over the past twelve months, Parfums de Marly aims to keep expanding at the same pace to reach the Top 10 of niche perfume brands. Among others, they will focus on developing sales in Asia and reinforcing their digital presence with a new website and e-shop. Lastly, the current offering of perfumes and candles will be completed with a bath range to be launched during the first semester 2018."
"Historical heritage: Kumano, from calligraphy to make-up brushes","Squirrel, goat, horse or badger hair, Tesshu Takemori makes the difference in an instant before detailing the properties of each animal hair for making makeup brushes. “Size, shape, suppleness, hardness, everything counts and decides the nature of the brush, its use (powder, foundation …).  If the tip of a hair is damaged, it is damn. And this know-how is transmitted from father to son,” says the Japanese artisan. Mr. Takemori is the heir of the brush workshop created in 1952 by his father Kazuo, president of Chikuho-Do, one of the iconic brush companies of Kumano, a city located about 20 kilometers from Hiroshima.  Chikuho-Do is also the creator of brushes for famous Japanese cosmetic brands such as Shiseido, RMK or Kanebo. Brushes are the recognized emblem of Kumano and the community even dedicates some religious ceremonies to the tool.  Approximately 80% of the Japan-made brushes for fine-arts, calligraphy and make-up are produced in this urban area of 24,000 inhabitants. About 1,500 employees of family-owned businesses work in this sector, including 20 “masters” such as Tesshu Takemori. “The tradition of handcrafted writing brushes already existed in other parts of Japan, such as Nara or Harima, but about 180 years ago people in the Kumano area thought they could produce cheaper items and sucessfully grew the business,” says Mr. Takemori during a tour of his company, which is lodged between beautiful traditional homes at the foot of the mountains.  At the time “quality was not exceptional”. Today, at Chikuho-Do, about a hundred staff, mostly women, are working to make thousands of brushes, using their hands and eyes as the main tools … but neither scissors nor computer! “The secret is to keep the tip of the hairs, not to cut it, because it is where their essential function is and that’s what differentiates our brushes from many foreign models,” insists the artisan. “The first step is to distribute the hairs that come from China, Russia, or other countries in the form of balls in layers. This is the only place where a machine is involved,” said Mr. Takemori. “This hand work is impossible to automate,” he says. Furthermore, all required tools have to be produced specially, such as the “koma”, a kind of wooden mould used to shape each brush, adds Tesshu’s grandson, Yutaro Takemori. Throughout the process, “rebellious and mischievous hairs are removed one by one with a sort of metallic blade which, coupled to the index finger, acts as a clamp. This sorting technique differs from those used anywhere else in the world,” says Tesshu Takenori. These small trade secrets, called “waza”, make the difference. “Of course, we know there are protest movements against the use of natural hair, but we do not kill animals specifically to make brushes,” insists the young Yutaro. According to him, the use of synthetic hairs is not necessarily a solution more environmental-friendly solution, given the required use of chemicals. “The creation of the nylon tips is now possible but it remains impossible to reproduce the cuticles of natural hairs,” adds his grandfather Tesshu. “International make-up artists working with most famous actresses and models, especially those of Paris fashion shows, do really appreciate Kumano’s brushes,” explains Yoko Miyake, who supports local artisans in their development abroad. The city exports its brushes to the United States, Europe and Asia, says the Kumano Manufacturers Association."

The quantum leap of Artcosmetics!,"Premium Beauty News - Artcosmetics was created in 1990! Hence, you will be celebrating its 27th anniversary! Pierfranco Accardo - Indeed our progression was fast, but it mostly increased in the early 2000s. From 2002 onwards, a targeted commercial policy enabled Artcosmetics to become a recognized manufacturer and a new benchmark in the Italian market. Artcosmetics is growing at an amazing pace. Our Company, a third-party make-up manufacturer posted a turnover of 45 million euros in 2015, up 25% over 2014, + 55% in 2016 reaching 70 million - we expect to close the fiscal year with 80 million euros. Tangible growth, thanks also to the expansion of the production capacity: over the years Artcosmetics has opened new sites and today it can rely on 11 production sites in Italy, a sales office in New York and an office in Seoul. Among major projects, the opening of a new factory in order to improve production capacity; a new factory, which will bring the total production area from the current 16,000 m2 square meters to more than 32,000 m2. As for this new factory that will be up and running in 2018, it will allow us to double production, nothing less! The Company’s name, Artcosmetics, draws on the primary values of Art, namely, vision, creativity and the ""look beyond"". Premium Beauty News - You owe much of your progression to your R&D Department...

These relationships are indispensable to create cutting edge formulas with quality ingredients. In the same way, true partnerships are established with packaging suppliers, with whom it is possible to materialize ideas for creating new gestures and new delivery systems. No less important is our collaboration with high-level designers for the development of cutting-edge mechanical technologies. Premium Beauty News - Your export business strategy is clearly focused on the United States? Pierfranco Accardo - That’s right, but Asia is also a key target. We actually recently opened an office in Seoul, South Korea."
"Asia, an unwavering appetite for conquest","To say the least, this small island, often subjected to clouds and rain, is still directly or indirectly in control of the Asian subcontracting industry. Everyone knows that its inhabitants have shaped and continue to shape the Asian packaging industry and are now increasingly involved in Full Service. The biggest players in mainland China are often Taiwanese natives. For the past several months, a number of Taiwanese manufacturers operating in the sector have also had a tendency to relocate on their island, ""less risky"", they claim. Anyhow, big or small businesses alike, industrial investments are continuing apace. This is the case with Capicolor, a small family owned business with a staff of 80 people created in 1972 and specialized in the manufacturing of eyeliners (5 million per year) but also eyebrow pencils (3 million per year), and for the past two years of eyeshadows. All products considered, the Company sells about 200 million units per year. Main customers: China, followed by Dubai Japan, India and other South-eastern Asian countries, not forgetting Britain and Sweden. The concept of Full Service continues to prevail in Taiwan like elsewhere. As a proof, the exponential growth of the firm Time Source, at first, twenty years ago, a packaging manufacturer for the beauty industry and who progressively but resolutely shifted to a Full Service offer. Fifty people, twenty injection moulding machines, five million dollars in sales, the Taiwanese Company which manufactures make-up compacts but also mascaras, will post this year a 25% growth in sales thanks in particular to its Full Service offer that it intends to further expand by offering more options. The commitment towards investment is the same at Cosmeti (16 million dollars in sales, 70% generated by the U.S. market and the remainder by Europe), another family owned business, specialized in the manufacture of make-up compacts, which employs 70 people and which is about to acquire a second brand new plant (operational by the end of next year) representing a total investment of 3 million dollars, with on top of it, a population of injection machines that will jump from 20 to 35 units. Note that moulds are all manufactured in-house. China, precisely, that will keep on making the headlines in the next few months with its dynamism and the fast creation of news brands accelerating by the week. Among the latest examples to date, the Beukay Group, both a subcontractor and owner of several brands, was created in 1997 by a brother and his sister, Gary Cui and Masa Cui, behind the creation, among others, of the brand Marie Dalgar, a big hit not only in China but also in the whole Asian continent, and which aims to conquer the rest of the world. A brand whose growth has been close to 60% over three years. A brand specialized in make-up products with a development based on traditional circuits but also (and thoroughly) on e-commerce with a team of nearly a hundred people fully dedicated daily to the job. A well-oiled sales and marketing strategy that leaves nothing to chance, combining both a presence on the ground, one-day promotional actions in malls, and trendy events. The main strike force of the Beukay Group both a subcontractor and brand creator: its three production sites spread over more than 25,000 m² of buildings and employing more than an thousand people, three R&D centres based in Shanghai, Tokyo and Paris. Main assets of the Group, its two leaders, Gary Cui and more particularly Masa Cui. ""Coming from a non cosmetic background, reads the Company’s presentation folder, there were many ups and down in the beginning of Masa. But her dedication towards the brands development, unique sense of vision, and her passion towards beauty make Marie Dalgar what it is today. Through constant innovation, artistic concept and the integration of inspiration, she has committed to build the brand into a top-notch artistic make-up brand in China"". Japan: the pioneering spirit of Nippon Shikizai The news had made the headlines a few weeks ago: The Japanese Group Nippon Shikizai announced the acquisition of the French Company Orleans Cosmetics, specializing mainly in the production of make-up powders. A Japanese Group created in 1957, with a staff of more than 750 people, whose turnover increased by 60% in three years and who had already bought in France, in 2000 the Thepenier Pharma Industrie Company. A group that can boast today an annual production capacity of more than 3,600 tonnes of liquid formulas, over 2,000 tonnes of pasty products, 350 tonnes of powders and 30 tonnes of hot-poured products. The Group is showing its commitment to growth in Europe but also in the United States and China."
"Dominique, a Maison de Beauté with real French inspirations in Brazil","Olivia Camplez used to work in Paris in the field of e-commerce (Apple, Pixmania), but four years ago, her dreams of remote places randomly drove her to São Paulo, Brazil. She decided to settle there, even though she did not speak Portuguese. She quickly met with local start-ups and gradually got used to her new Paulista life. But one thing was missing: a choice of high-end, niche cosmetics and skincare products. In just a few days, she got the idea of opening a concept store dedicated to this world: her own Maison de Beauté. Once she had set up her business plan, found funding sources, chosen the brands and products she wanted to be referenced, as well as the store location, moved in, and taken care of customs barrier administrative issues, among others, Dominique - Maison de Beauté opened at last, on a late November day in 2016. Designed by the Centdegrés agency as a Parisian Haussmanian flat, the place is welcoming and unusual. Dermatologist Joëlle Ciocco provides professional treatments in the beauty salon area, and about twenty brands are offered in the store area: they were all chosen with great care according to ethical criteria, and with a holistic rather than exclusively cosmetic vision of beauty and wellness. Treatments for the face (By Terry, Diptyque, Joëlle Ciocco), body (Uka), and hair (Christophe Robin, Rahua), makeup products (Ilia, RMS Beauty), and perfumes (Terry de Ginsburg) complete the offering of candles (Cire Trudon, Diptyque), pillows, accessories, and tea (Kusmi Tea). “I wanted a concept that would embody beauty’s paradise, a place where customers would feel at home and warmly welcomed and advised to find everything that would contribute to their own wellness. I wanted to develop the notion of shopping experience,” Olivia explains. The concept has no equivalent in Brazil, which makes it attractive: it became a success in just a few months. “In Brazil, women love novelty and originality. In addition, even in times of crisis, they actually find refuge in beauty,” the creator has observed. “There is also quite a new phenomenon. In this country fond of plastic surgery, skincare lags behind other segments. And yet, today’s women, our 30 to 60-year-old customers, most of whom regularly travel, are increasingly more receptive to naturalness, organic products, and ethics. They no longer need to get immediate results, they act consciously, and they have this notion of time and product and use quality,” she adds. Given the first results and thanks to her main investor Galeries Lafayette, Olivia intends to keep growing. She will organize several pop-up stores before the end of the year in Brasilia and Rio and also plans to open other shops in Mexico and Colombia. As for products, new brands from all continents will soon be referenced, in particular perfume brands. The idea is to launch six new ones per year, and maybe a private label as well."
Pascual Cosmétiques: a thriving subcontractor,"Simon Pascual, the company’s General Manager, has invested 12 million euros in the acquisition and fitting-out of a 20,000 m2 plant, including 5,000 m2 dedicated to the Pascual Cosmétiques activity (compared to 1,900 m2 for the former site), with a much larger R&D laboratory, a production area well-proportioned to integrate several new lines, and a storage area with a total capacity of 1,800 palettes. The 15,000 m2 remaining are rented to other companies. As soon as late August 2017, the subcontractor will inaugurate a new lipstick line with flexible moulds on this site, for a new production capacity of 1.8 million items per month, compared to 1 million right now. In the course of the year, a filling line for flexible tubes will complete the production tool. Pascual Cosmétiques mainly develops, manufactures and conditions makeup products – lipsticks, blushes, eye shadows, blushers, nail varnish, and creams in jars – except for powders and pencils. The company works for many major French and global brands. Their turnover has increased threefold over the past three years (4.8 million euros in 2016, compared to 1.6 million in 2014), and the management has banked on a 25 to 35% growth in 2017. To keep up with this growth, beyond their investments in new premises and equipment, Pascual Cosmétiques is about to proceed to new recruitments, both for production and technical positions, in particular in R&D, or reps functions. In the long run, the company does not exclude carrying out an external growth operation, in France or abroad, preferably with a player equipped with a powder division. In addition, the company will showcase their latest innovations at the MakeUp in Paris show, which will be held at the Carrousel du Louvre in Paris on June 22-23, 2017. It will be an opportunity to discover Cream to Powder Lips, a lipstick whose creamy texture when it is applied on the skin instantaneously turns into a silky powder to lay down a light coloured touch on the lips, without any material sensation. In fact, this innovation was selected by the MakeUp in Paris innovation jury to be part of the Innovation Tree, where the best innovations developed by the show’s exhibitors are showcased every year. Also on the agenda, Color Illusion Lipstick, a range with ultra-modern colours that slide on the lips to create a soft, satin-like film with clearly wiser colours, from tender pink to intense plum. Now, that is a company to keep an eye on!"
Natura aims to become a global cosmetics leader,"Acquired by L’Oréal in 2006, The Body Shop is a British brand of nature-inspired cosmetic products.  Founded in 1976 by Anita Roddick in Brighton, England, The Body Shop has expanded into a global leader in natural beauty, with the deep-rooted belief that business can be ethical and sustainable. The Body Shop is now present in more than 60 countries around the world, through various distribution channels including more than 3,000 point of sales (130 in Brazil) and e-commerce. In 2016, it generated retail sales of around 1.5 billion euros and net sales of 921 million euros. “Natura is the best new owner we could imagine to nurture the brand DNA around naturality and ethics,” said Jean-Paul Agon, Chairman & CEO of L’Oréal. Indeed, the values of Natura Cosméticos - which offers products made from natural ingredients, in particular Amazonian nuts or berries sustainable and ethically sourced from communities - are very close to those of The Body Shop. ""Natura and The Body Shop have always followed parallel paths that are now converging,"" said Guilherme Leal, co-chairman of Natura Cosméticos’ board of directors of. However, as far as their geographical presence and distribution channels are concerned, the two companies are very different. The Body Shop is present in more than 60 countries around the world, mainly in Europe, Asia, North America and the Middle East, but its footprint in South America (Brazil and Chile) is quite smaller (2% of the global turnover). The Natura brand, on the other hand, is mainly present in Brazil and in South America.  The Brazilian company, which initiated its international development in 2013 with the acquisition of Aesop, finds in the acquisition of The Body Shop the opportunity to dramatically accelerate its global growth. Furthermore, the acquisition of The Body Shop will help Natura to accelerate the diversification of its distribution channels while offering the opportunity to expand the presence of the British brand in Brazil through its network of 1.3 million consultants. The proposed transaction will be submitted to L’Oréal’s employee representative body and is subject to regulatory approval notably in Brazil and in the United States. According to L’Oréal, the proposed transaction is expected to close during 2017."
Ancorotti Cosmetics: Targeting 100 million euros in 2017,"The production of mascaras remains the main propeller of the company’s development, while leaving room for other emerging makeup products as well. The Italian firm is now present in all the niches of the makeup sector. ""Our emphasis is now on foundations, lipsticks and extruded powders. Several machines were purchased for this"" announces Mr Ancorotti. The company has further increased its fleet of back injection machines by bringing it to 23 units. ""We are undoubtedly the first in the world to own so many machines of this type"" he claims. In the meantime, the company has carried out the purchase of an industrial unit next to the already owned buildings. This site truly represents industrial archaeology: it was created in 1969 by the well-known architect Zanuso, with the collaboration of Renzo Piano, for Olivetti, the famous typewriter manufacturer. Ancorotti Cosmetics has decided to renovate these 30000 sqm building to restore its prestige and image. The works will last for about a year and a half. Moreover, the figures concerning employment are indicative of Ancorotti Cosmetics’ continuous growth: 372 people are employed, with a majority of women. Women represent 65% of the employees. In 2016, 90 temporary contracts were confirmed and, this year, another 40 people have been employed. These numbers speak for themselves. “Moreover, the company is very young: the average age is 36 and the employees come from 15 different countries, with the objective of becoming an even younger and more culturally and ethnically diverse company,” Mr Ancorotti says. The export business represents more than 80% of the total sales volume. Ancorotti Cosmetics’ focus for 2017 will be on the US market, which will continue to grow in 2018 and be a driving force in the beauty industry, in particular thanks to the engaging social media communication of US colour cosmetic brands. In this context, Ancorotti Cosmetics’ main goal is to continue to provide fresh and innovative ideas, inspiring major companies and offering creative products.  The company will thus present its latest innovations at the Make Up in Paris event (June 22-23, 2017). “The whole company works on the preparation of this participation. The makeup trends deepened for this 2017 edition are a tale of two extremes: classy and elegant colours (porcelain skin, flushed cheeks and striking eyes plus full, outstanding lips) or high amounts of glitters, metallic hues and shine, with textures reminding of desert sand and broken glass. All this, with a great attention to the vegan concept and to the quality of the ingredients used.”"
"The Germany make-up industry, more than ever at the top!","A dynamism embodied by one of the jewels of the German industry, Schwan Cosmetics (3,200 employees) whose sales have increased significantly in the 2015/2016 fiscal year, rising by 14.3% to 364.3 million euros including more than 174 million for sharpenable pencils, more than 112 million for mechanical pencils, 62 millions for liquid liners and more than 17 million for mascaras and other products.  Investments amounted to more than 30 million euros and were made predominantly in the development of new products and in increasing capacity in Germany and abroad. “More than half a billion consumers require an enormous product range, particularly as their requirements are becoming more and more individual. Our aim is to create the perfect products for every woman in the world,” said the Managing Director Dr. Jörg Karas. Schwan Cosmetics is represented by ten subsidiaries across four continents (Germany, Czech Republic, China, Indonesia, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and the United States). A year after opening the Centre of Excellence in Murfreesboro, Tennessee (USA), Schwan Cosmetics can see positive first results: Production has got off to a good start and the integration of the new employees has been completed. The strategy of opening local production sites in the markets is also paying off in Central and South America. After expanding their Mexico site, the Colombia site was in turn expanded. As for the current year, digital will be the hallmark of the year for the German company. Bernd Preuschoff, Schwan Cosmetics’ new Vice President Digital Transformation, will launch discussions in a keynote at the round table on Beauty in the Digital era, at the next MakeUp in Paris. For Bernd Preuschoff, ""digital change is on the way. For companies, it is essential to identify these changes and seize new opportunities for innovation."" Recently, Schwan Cosmetics also launched the ""Schwan Digital Studio"": This unit is central to all themes related to digital transformation in the company; its role will be to collect new ideas, test them and bring them to market quickly. To deliver a quality digital experience, according to Bernd Preuschoff, digital technology must not only inspire the user, it must most of all satisfy its needs and solve its problems while generating a ""wow effect”. At the MakeUp in Paris trade show, Bernd Preuschoff will explain why the use of digital, to inspire the consumer in the field of beauty, is not going far enough. Indeed, other industries that have been considerably ""shaken"" by the digital wave have had to acknowledge that users expect most of all, solutions meeting their needs. Hence if cosmetic companies focus not only on inspiration but on the user’s experience, they will also have to prepare themselves to deal with ""digital perturbations"". Mascara, the ""flagship"" product! The Rusi company another player based in the Nuremberg region is just as dynamic; the Company employs 180 people with EUR20 million in sales, i.e., an increase of more than 8% in 2016 compared to the previous year. Its owner and CEO, Klaus Sindel, has every reason of being satisfied. Specialized in the manufacture of mascaras but also lipgloss and eyeliners, the Company after having invested half a million euros in 2016 in its production tool, plans to buy five more injection machines in the twelve months to come, that is an increase in production of about 20%... ""Being fully autonomous and integrated at the manufacturing level is indeed a strong commitment of the company,”  saidKlaus Sindel. A few kilometres from there, at Geka, which belongs since last year to the Swiss Group, Sulzer, the finding is the same!  The factory in Bechhofen will soon be too small. ""This merger will result in the creation of a major player in the field of precision plastic injection,” stated a few months ago its CEO, Amaury de Mentière.  “We must now finalize our integration within the APS Division and make use of industrial and development synergies. Mixpac which is also part of the APS Division is known for its mastery in the management of fluids and mixers. We could certainly use this expertise in the area of make-up and other cosmetics. We are working on it. We also plan to expand our Bechoffen plant and works are expected to begin later this year.” In addition, Geka has further expanded its Brazil plant and could successfully launch the first local products. Geka has introduced a number of new products such as the pureSENSATION 2K brush, the softSECRET Sandwich brush or the LASH STAR Supernova Mascara with the patented multi-benefit brush, just to name a few... Upper north, between Bonn and Cologne, in the small town of Niederkassel next to the Rhine River, the 100% family owned Company, United Brands Marketing GmbH (UBM). The classic German family Company headed by David J. Kohen (CEO USA) and his wife Ivonne K. Kohen (CEO Europe), remains a model of its kind. With its 60 people from 28 different nations and nearly EUR12 million in sales expected in 2017 - mainly specialized in the manufacturing of liquid eyeliner ink pens and dip liners – including all the plastic parts manufactured in house -, time is more than ever for expansion, investments and diversification. Over the past few months, UBM have invested the hefty amount of 3.2 million euros only in their headquarters in Germany in the acquisition of eight injection machines, six fully automatic pen assembly machines and six hot stamp printing machines – and the first robotic fully automatic subunit packing machine. The company also set up its United States subsidiary United Brands Manufacturing Inc. beginning of 2016. A new show room will be opened around June 2017 in New York Manhattan because of the massive growing number of US clients and multinationals. The first US factory with 2.000 m² production space is planned for the year 2019 in the State of New Jersey – exactly the same products but Made in USA. ""We are certainly the only manufacturer in the world offering so many models, designs and different sizes of Liquid Ink Liner Pens in every major market segment – mass, middle and luxury premium. We offer pens in 4 different diameters (8 mm, 10 mm, 12 mm and 16 mm), jumbo size; all products are available also with PBT brush nibs,"" explained David J. Kohen, owner and CEO. And there is more to come! The firm, which already launched in March 2017 the new Dip Liner product line, is now about to launch in the fourth quarter of 2017 a new range of mechanical / retractable wax lead pencils. The next planned step end in 2018 is to enter the niche of mascaras. ""We are fortunate to own over 45.000 m² of land for further expansion around our existing 3 factory buildings,"" said David J. Kohen. As a consequence, he has already planned the construction of a new 10.800 m² new modern GMP building on two levels for the end of 2018 next to the existing factories. As for the number of new products and innovations that regularly emerge from the Company’s Product Development Department, they are galore... As for Faber Castell Cosmetics, at the headquarters of the German group in Stein near Nuremberg, smiles are on all faces. Out of a total staff of over 7,500 people worldwide, nearly 800 of them are part of the Cosmetic business unit. A Division that posted excellent results last year with double-digit sales growth. ""Step by step,"" recently explained the Managing Director Christina Zech, ""we adjust our textures to be able to produce them similarly on all our production sites, thus providing us and our customers a high level of flexibility. On the whole, we strive to increase our global reach and to be closer to our customers. In addition, we are working on an extension of our packaging offer, with innovative formulas specially developed for each format; this is as you know, one of our key competences. Our international customers can be sure to find at a ‘one-stop shop’: high quality products, convenience and safety where we stand behind with our reputation.” Concerning products, the company highlights its Slim Plastic line MAGNETIC, “the perfect pencil for super long-lasting eye- and lip-formulations.”  It can easily be customized in any colour and is now available with shiny, matte, pearly and metallic finish.  “We developed extraordinary formulations and a striking colour range that varies from classic to electric, matte to metallic. Its gel-like consistency makes it glide-on like a dream then sets to a super lasting finish,” she adds. During MakeUp in Paris this year, Faber Castell Cosmetics is going to showcase “an extraordinary full colour, wet shine lipstick texture that is super creamy and buttery and thanks to our Jumbo-sized pencil a mess-free and controlled application is a breeze.” Eventually, for Faber Castell Cosmetics, liquid eyeliners are one of the main drivers in the cosmetics world. “We offer Slim and Chubby Liquid liners with a variety of different tips for different styles. At Cosmopack Bologna we presented two new tips: PEEK-A-BOO eye styler has a paddle tip with integrated peek that provides a double-flow passage around the central opening ensuring a continuous, extraordinary saturated line. And, CANDY BEAD lip tint has a bubble-shaped tip with cushion feel. It glides on easily with a smooth touch and provides a soft and saturated line. We presented it with a 10h lasting liptint but of course, you can also have it in an eyeliner format.”"
MS swiss cosmetics gains momentum,"One year after its arrival on the market and after the kick-start of its first production batches in October 2016, the new-comer continues to consolidate its assets to seduce the ultra-premium cosmetics brands. The company already operates brand-new and state-of-the-art and OTCs-compliant production facilities. For instance, MS swiss cosmetics has ""clean rooms"" to produce cosmetic cares in optimal hygiene and safety conditions and in total match with the European, Asian and American regulations. As soon as they are delivered, the raw materials are checked in a dedicated space, that is equipped with a laminar flow. A WHM (Ware House Management) system manages 6,000 pallet locations in FIFO / FEFO mode. The whole facility has been conceived to control the flows - air, materials - and to avoid any risk of cross contamination. Within the installations, the manufacturing rooms have the latest generation equipment according to the type of formulas to be manufactured: emulsions, lotions, etc.  In particular, MS swiss cosmetics is equipped with full airless production tanks, a process that allows to ensure a better preservation of the final product as well as the highest emulsion quality, free from air bubbles. A specific equipment is dedicated to the filling of flexible tubes, bottles and jars, airless & full-airless bottles, and the manufacturing of single use masks. MS swiss cosmetics carries out bulk production and filling services, as well as quality checks and certifications in compliance with regulatory prescriptions and customers requirements. MS has embedded the ISO 9001, ISO 22716, OHSAS 18001-2007 standards in its Quality Management System.  An integrated organoleptic and physic-chemical analysis laboratory facilitates the control operations throughout the production process. Microbiological analyses are outsourced to an ISO 17025 accredited laboratory.  The Swiss-quality of the products is also linked to the quality of the water used in the production site.  “The products benefit from the exceptional location of the facility, which is dominated by the Dent de Lys, where the Veveyse-de-Châtel river takes its origin. As a major component of cosmetics care, the water that is supplied to the plant is of a very high quality level at the very outset. It is then purified by reverse osmosis system before being distributed in the clean rooms,” claims MS swiss cosmetics. Starting in the summer of 2017, MS will run an in-house R & D laboratory. The formulas, which were previously developed by Strand Cosmetics Europe in Lyon, will be designed in the Swiss facility. Thanks to MS swiss cosmetics production and R&D capabilities, customers can benefit from the ’Swiss made’ label, the of which requirements were made tougher at the beginning of January 2017 [1]. Besides designing, manufacturing and packaging of formulas, MS swiss cosmetics offers complementary services for the design and manufacture of rigid boxes and of co-packing. Indeed, the company benefits from its proximity with Marvinpac, whose operations of design and manufacture of rigid boxes and co-packing are historically dedicated to a prestigious brand, extends now to the whole world of luxury. Concern for quality finds its parallel in a marked concern for the environment.  The building has been designed to limit its environmental footprint: the rooftop is covered by solar panels, temperature controlled via 18 geothermal probes, 80% recycled air, waste management, etc. With this wide range of assets, MS swiss cosmetics has the ambition to become the reference of Swiss cosmetic formulation serving national and international premium cosmetics brands."
Douglas expands in Italy with the acquisition of Limoni and La Gardenia,"German headquartered beauty retailer Douglas has taken a significant step to further expand its strong position internationally.  The Group has announced to have reached an agreement for the acquisition of two leading Italian beauty and perfumery chains - Limoni and La Gardenia, together trading as Leading Luxury Group (LLG) - from a group of investors led by private equity firm Orlando Italy Management. Limoni and La Gardenia joined forces in 2013 and form one of the leading beauty and perfumery retailers in Italy. With approximately 500 stores across all regions, they form the most extensive beauty and perfumery network in Italy.  Douglas, which already runs 126 stores in the country, thus becomes the leading player in the Italian beauty retail sector. “Following our recent acquisition of Bodybell in Spain, we are now strengthening our business in yet another core market in Europe. By integrating LLG into our pan-European store network, Douglas will now become a leading player in the Italian beauty sector. This transaction is a major step on our journey to becoming the No. 1 or strong No. 2 in every market we serve”, said Isabelle Parize, CEO of Douglas.  “Amongst others Douglas will contribute its own products from its successful ‘Douglas Collection’ range as well as considerable online expertise,” she added. Post-transaction, Douglas will operate more than 2,000 perfumeries (from 1,700 stores to date) across 19 countries in Europe, from Portugal to Latvia, combined with a network of online shops. The transaction, the financial details of which have not been disclosed, is subject to customary conditions including merger control approval. At the beginning of 2016, the Group has announced an investment program of more than EUR 100 million with the aim to broaden its international footprint, but also to enhance the Douglas brand and boost omni-channel capabilities."
MakeUp in and Luxe Pack: focused on Shanghai and Los Angeles!,"Premium Beauty News - The ""MakeUp In"" trade shows and the Luxe Pack trade shows, a marriage of convenience? Nathalie Grosdidier - Much more than that, an obvious complementarity serving the entire Luxury and Beauty sector offering huge opportunities in terms of synergy in certain geographical areas. And a common feature, Excellence in very specific niches: luxury packaging and the make-up and skincare industry, from ingredients to digital technologies, including packaging and make-up accessories. Two series of events bringing together the ""cream"" of global suppliers with the highest responsibility levels. Unique, quality events, unlike no others, that focus on efficient contacts and business opportunities within a very short period of time, by offering professionals all inclusive services to allow them to only concentrate on what matters most: their products, clients and suppliers. The whole of it, with an optimal budgetary envelope. Allow me to recall some figures concerning the shows: Luxe Pack Monaco hosts 480 exhibitors and is attended by 8,600 visitors, at Luxe Pack New York, there are 250 exhibitors and 3,700 visitors, while at Luxe Pack Shanghai there are 200 exhibitors and 4,000 visitors. As for the MakeUp In trade shows they bring together more than 500 exhibitors and more than 10,000 visitors each year. Figures speak for themselves! Premium Beauty News - You mean complementarity and synergy while respecting the personalities of each partner? This is the case in Europe and on the east coast of the United States... Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Absolutely! It makes no doubt that MakeUp in Paris, which takes place every year in June at the Carrousel du Louvre, has become a must, just like Luxe Pack in Monaco in October. A perfect geographic, strategic and temporal complementarity. MakeUp in New York, which takes place each year in September and Luxe Pack New York in May, have the same positioning; both of them have succeeded in making a name for themselves in the United States by offering exactly what U.S. professionals are looking for. But the world of make-up and luxury packaging is not confined to the European continent and the U.S. east coast. The success met by the first two editions of MakeUp in Los Angeles is the best proof. There are indeed two countries in the United States that complement one another. Similarly, the successes of MakeUp in Asia in Seoul and of Luxe Pack in Shanghai perfectly demonstrate the economic and cultural variety of a region with fast changing demographics. Premium Beauty News - Rumours circulating were correct, you can now confirm for 2018, the creation of the first Luxe Pack Los Angeles concomitantly to MakeUp in Los Angeles and of the first MakeUp in Action in Shanghai alongside Luxe Pack Shanghai? Nathalie Grosdidier - Actually our strategy in Asia is quite simple! MakeUp in Asia in Seoul, which was literally acclaimed this year by visitors and exhibitors, proved its efficiency and popularity and will remain in Seoul next end of April 2018. And to meet the needs of many companies wishing to extend the ""MakeUp In"" concept to China, they will also be delighted with the first edition of a MakeUp in Action in Shanghai alongside Luxe Pack Shanghai, early April. As for the United States, the winning momentum generated by MakeUp in Los Angeles will fully serve the first edition of Luxe Pack Los Angeles at the beginning of next year. In both cases, be it in Asia or in the United States, exhibitors in the luxury and beauty industry will take advantage of the efficiency, complementarity and richness of contacts. Premium Beauty News - MakeUp in Paris will open its doors in a few days. How are the prospects looking? Sandra Maguarian - They are excellent, of course! About 160 exhibitors and some 3,000 visitors expect... A new edition more than ever dedicated to innovation and digital. The unavoidable appointment of the global make-up and skincare industry. Premium Beauty News - And Luxe Pack Monaco next fall? Nathalie Grosdidier - More than ever unique! This global showcase of creative packaging has many surprises in store for visitors with many launches and innovations to discover at the stands. Like last year, a specific programme will be dedicated to digital with again the C2L-Connect to Luxury, a show within the show. There will also be a focus on arts and crafts related to packaging, sustainable development of course,with the Luxe Pack in green award and many more highlights that help put forward the tremendous innovation potential of the entire industry and seize emerging trends. Without forgetting conviviality as always, especially since we will be celebrating the 30th edition. Premium Beauty News - A few words on this new edition of Luxe Pack New York that just closed its doors... Nathalie Grosdidier - This fifteenth edition was marked by interactivity and a lot of visitors appreciated the various animations offered such as the Turbo Talks, the Creativity Workshop, the Innovations Wall, and the Seminars. Not to mention the conference programme that brought together more than 1,000 people over the 2 days. A new record!"
Scentys targets the general public with two new innovations,"Premium Beauty News - You created Scentys 13 years ago, based on an innovative concept: the principle of capsules containing small pearls of pure perfume concentrate placed in front of an air flow. This way, the perfume diffuses thanks to the evaporation of the concentrate for a natural, absolutely faithful olfactory reproduction. How have you managed to develop, since then?  David Suissa - Scentys is actually an expert in the air diffusion of very high quality perfume now. We have become experts in technical solutions and optimum safety of use. Today, we are among the best as regards this technology, and we have always been firmly established on the fine fragrance segment. Our first customers were perfume brands, creation houses like Givaudan or IFF, or distributors, but we gradually managed to reach several other industries, in particular transport, like the car industry. Over the past six months, we have worked in collaboration with Peugeot and Valeo, so that all 3008 and 5008 standard models are now fitted with our capsules to perfume car passenger cells. Premium Beauty News - What are your latest innovations? David Suissa - We have just launched a new solution to make people discover perfumes in points of sale: Fine Touch. It is a system based on our perfume pearl technology, which is placed in the particular configuration of an elegant object. It combines several advantages, like reducing the constraints related to spray testers, offering a new, original gesture to consumers, and providing a faithful, qualitative perfume experience without the ‘alcohol’ effect. Premium Beauty News - Does that mean the general public will experience the Scentys technology for the first time? David Suissa - Some of them have already done so. A year ago, we developed a home diffuser called Prysme. It was initially designed for professionals, but we received many requests from private individuals, so it is now available in Darty stores and on Amazon. It is a first step for us in terms of home perfume diffusion. There will be others, but we are really happy with the feedback we got for this product. Talking about the general public, we are launching a new product designed for car passenger cells: Capsy. The idea is to provide an absolutely safe solution to a rising demand for cars, with good quality perfumes stable over time. The object in which the solid perfume capsule is introduced is clipped on the ventilation grid of the vehicle. The device may be opened or closed with a protective cover, so users can enjoy a perfume function upon request. It costs 19.90 euros. Two perfume capsules developed by creation houses are available for now, for 12 euros, and they both last about 50 hours. Premium Beauty News - What are your results and prospects? David Suissa -  We are a 100% French company with about twenty employees, and we grew by 41% in 2016, compared to 2015. 2017 should be just as successful. As regards our products, our prospects clearly involve working on innovations to pave the way for new perfume applications. Now, as far as business is concerned, our export turnover for Asia, South America, and Europe represents 30%. So, we aim to find new sources of growth abroad to further strengthen our global presence."
Birchbox bases its growth strategy on data,"Birchbox, which operates in six countries (United States, France, Belgium, UK, Ireland and Spain), has opened its first brick-and-mortar boutique in France, the second in the world after New York, opened in 2014. The first consequence of the opening of this new point of sale is the entry of prestige beauty brands with distribution contracts requiring at least one brick-and-mortar shop for the distribution of their products.  Thus, leading beauty brands such as Clarins, Clinique, Bobbi Brown and Bumble & Bumble have joined the Birchbox catalogue in France. However, according to Philippe Pinatel, President and COO at Birchbox, the first goal of this new store is to strengthen ties with customers.  ""Our goal is not to boost customer recruitment but to increase the engagement of our community,"" he said. ""That’s why we opened a studio upstairs the store and which will allow us to organize events for our members."" Logically, the next development step will be the opening of a first brick-and-mortar shop in the UK rather than the opening of another point-of-sale in France. In-depth consumer knowledge and optimal customization of the offer are a corner-stone of the company’s growth strategy.  ""For a brick-and-mortar retailer, in-store traffic is the most important figure, but it is a very impersonal data. On the contrary, e-retailers gather a lot of data. We even developed several algorithms to exploit that and to better meet the expectations of our customers,"" adds Philippe Pinatel. Actually, Birchbox must manage 50 different boxes in France and 150 in the United States, and must be careful not to put twice the same product in a box.  The company thus developed a series of interpretation models to better anticipate the expectations of its clients and to customize the visit of its e-shop.  “ Algorithms are at the heart of our business.  In this context, the brick-and-mortar shop allows us to diversify the data we collect.”"
"""Virtual makeup is also a tool for detecting emerging trends,"" Sylvain Delteil, Perfect Corp.","Premium Beauty News - The world of virtual reality make-up apps is increasingly concentrated around a limited number of players. Sylvain Delteil - Indeed, the time when each brand was considering the opportunity to develop its own application is over. On the one hand, no one can download a different app for each brand on its smartphone and, on the other hand, brands aim to address as many consumers as possible, not only their fans. Today, only a few applications have been successful to aggregate a significant number of users worldwide. YouCam apps have passed the 400 million downloads mark worldwide, thus becoming one of market leaders with Meitu, which is very strong in China but has little presence outside of this market. Premium Beauty News - How do you explain the success of YouCam apps? Sylvain Delteil - The main reason is the quality of the results achieved through our virtual reality makeup technology and the variety of options available in the apps. We are constantly working to improve the virtual make-up quality. Furthermore, our suite of applications (YouCam Makeup, YouCam Perfect, YouCam Fun, YouCam Nails and Beauty Circle) is very consistent. It is a very complete ecosystem designed to allow a comprehensive journey in the beauty world, from discovery to purchase, through sharing and exchange ... Our CEO, Alice H. Chang, has a true vision of women’s needs. She puts technology at the service of these needs rather than trying to push technologies... YouCam apps are not just an engineering creation, but a consistent set designed to fit the needs of users. That is why, for example, the app offers monthly looks corresponding to astral signs. This service generates a considerable number of connections to the app! Premium Beauty News - What types of partnerships do you offer to brands? Sylvain Delteil - It’s custom made. Each brand has its own very specific needs and expectations. Furthermore, these needs may vary from one country to another, depending on whether the brand operates its own e-shop or not. We offer brands the opportunity to put their products forward. Eventually, the users can be directed to an online boutique. We record high visitation rates of e-shops linked to the app, even without ads. However, we do not calculate conversion rates because we do not have our own shop. Premium Beauty News - How do you make money? Sylvain Delteil - We charge the brands according to the number of products they make available to users on the apps. This is also a good means to avoid that unnecessary products be uploaded in our databases. Interested brands can also invest in advertising, to give even more visibility to their products. Premium Beauty News - Do you also work with retailers? Sylvain Delteil - Retailers are showing a growing interest in our services. Initially, some of them were suspicious that our applications could be their competitors. Now, everybody agrees apps and brick-and-mortar shops are all very complementary. Applications can be used to attract consumers in shops for personalized and one-to-one counselling, promotional campaigns, and more. Also, there are mixed cases of brand-distributor partnerships. Some brands do not refer to their own e-shop but to a retailer. Tablets that only offer products of a given brand can be made available to users inside a retail outlet. It is an effective way for engaging a conversation with the consumer. And we can do a lot of testing, which is impossible with just one product. Premium Beauty News - It’s also a huge source of information. Data collection is at the heart of your model. Sylvain Delteil - Analytical feedbacks are very much appreciated by our partners. We own a tremendous amount of information available. For a country like Italy, for instance, there are several tens of thousands of uses per day for a brand. And there are more and more comments on the products. The brands on the app have access to a portal providing real time information, and for the last six months, on how users use the products available on the application. We can see which products are tested, which ones are used to create a look, and which ones have been saved. It is a dynamic interface that makes it possible to produce statistical representations by product types and by colours. Brands can also ask us to search for specific data (deep dive). Premium Beauty News - A huge amount of data is available through your apps, but are they really illustrative of the market? Sylvain Delteil - It all depends on the brands and their customers.  Indeed, 80% of our audience is under 34 years of age. However, the data we collect are based on large volumes, even if they are very focused on millennials ... Many brands consider that our data allow to identify trends, as well as weak signals from emerging trends... And this will allow them to make decisions almost instantaneously without having to wait for the quarterly figures. Premium Beauty News - What are your next development prospects? Sylvain Delteil - We continue to develop the functionalities of our applications. We recently launched live cast sessions in the United States, which allowed us to offer online live events, such as tutorials, events with brand ambassadors, makeup artists, etc. We also strive to refine our offer by working on skin textures, beyond skin tone, in order to be able to suggest skin treatments.  It is more complex than makeup but it is a major development avenue..."
Kiko Milano celebrates 20 years and adds Brazil to its global expansion strategy,"Known internationally for its masstige approach to makeup products, the fast-fashion beauty brand unveils a portfolio of over than 1,200 items, mostly manufactured in Europe. In an exclusive interview with Premium Beauty News, Kiko Milano’s brand director in Brazil, Isabel de Almeida, talks about the brand’s plans and the operational challenges it has faced to establish itself in such a vast and diverse country. Premium Beauty News - What is Kiko Milano’s total investment in Brazil and what is the strategic importance of the country to fuel the brand’s global expansion? Isabel de Almeida - Kiko Milano will invest a total of € 5 million in the opening of the seven stores in São Paulo. Brazil has been the brand’s target since its founding two decades ago, when CEO Stefano Percassi was charmed by the country. As part of our global expansion, we have entered strategic markets, such as the UAE, India, Qatar and Russia. Brazil is the largest economy in Latin America and, therefore, is of critical importance in the development of the brand. Premium Beauty News - What were the challenges in establishing the company in Brazil? Isabel de Almeida - Our original plan was to launch in Brazil in 2016, but we had some legal setbacks during the import process, which eventually delayed the project by a year. At the moment, our greatest challenge is to develop the brand in such a vast country with so many unique features. This has urged the company to reorganize itself locally in order to reach its goals. Premium Beauty News - How does the brand plan to deal with Brazil’s huge diversity? Will the stores follow the same style and layout? Isabel de Almeida – The brand’s global concept and vision will remain consistent, but we will need to adapt the layout of the stores to the local processes and inventory. We decided to use São Paulo as a starting point so we can accommodate to local market demands before we move on to other states. Premium Beauty News - Who is Kiko Milano’s target audience in Brazil? Isabel de Almeida - The brand caters to all age groups, but there is greater demand from women aged 15 to 35. Generally speaking, our target consumers are urban, fashion-oriented and on top of the latest trends. Premium Beauty News - Will the Brazilian operation have its own marketing and communication strategies? Does Kiko have plans to launch an eCommerce platform in Brazil in the near future? Isabel de Almeida - Our strategy will be adapted to the local reality without compromising the global identity. This differentiation will become more evident in the medium term as the Brazilian market evolves and presents specific demands. The online channel will not be launched immediately, but it is in our future plans. Premium Beauty News - What competitive advantages does Kiko Milano offer to tackle competition from other Brazilian players? Isabel de Almeida - We are releasing most of our existing product ranges in Brazil, including 35 different shades of foundation. We expect to launch seven collections per year and introduce new products monthly. Premium Beauty News - What global makeup trends are likely to have a good response from Brazilian consumers? Isabel de Almeida - Dark lipstick shades, including blue and black, are a worldwide trend and are also popular in Brazil. Brazilian shoppers keep up with the latest trends, do their research before buying and are open to product recommendations. Premium Beauty News - Kiko has a list of ingredients that are no longer used in its formulations. Are there any other raw materials that will be banned in Brazil? Isabel de Almeida – All Kiko products adhere to the strictest security protocols both in the short and long run. In addition, we have created a list of ingredients that are prohibited for use in our formulations. Despite being permitted by local regulations in some countries, they are not considered acceptable by the brand. As an example, our products have been formulated without the use of parabens since 2014. Premium Beauty News - Kiko is known for its affordable prices. What allows you to offer and maintain the current price point? Isabel de Almeida - Some product ranges are very price-competitive, but most products will be positioned as medium-priced as they are subject to import duties. Although the margins applied are lower than those in Europe, the tax burden will have an impact on pricing."
Digital tools are transforming Marionnaud’s business,"Since July 2015, all Marionnaud France stores have been equipped with one or more tablets. This deployment is part of the different digital transformation initiated by the retailer a few years ago. Yet, the launch of the ""Code Beauté"" [1] in April 2015 enabled the brand to be among the first beauty retailers to place data at the heart of its customer relationship. Since the launch, more than 700,000 ""Codes Beauté"" have been produced and have served to feed the company’s databases. Aggregated to information coming from the company’s website and online shop, or collected during purchases, and to the analysis of e-mails behaviours, and to the information linked to loyalty cards, these data helped to build a more targeted offer, with products tailored to each store’s clientele, and personalized to each customer’s profile. At the global level, A.S. Watson is also investing in new tools that would allow an ever more integrated management of these data. Today, a customer entering a Marionnaud store and taken in charge by a shop assistant with her tablet can be instantly identified with her loyalty card.  Thus, personalized treatment can then be offered to her throughout her visit, including the mobile payment of purchases. For clients less interested in advices from store consultants and looking for a more independent purchasing experience, the retailer has strengthened digital in-store services: free broadband wifi in all its stores, free Click & Collect servie, skin diagnosis, etc. Besides customer relationship, digitization also concerns the company’s entire operations, for instance for stock management. In the event of stock shortage, tablets provide store consultants with information on the nearest store where the stock is available. Marionnaud France - along with other retail chains from the A.S. Watson group, such as ICI Paris XL in the Netherlands and The Perfume Shop in the UK - selected the digital merchandising solution developed by JDA Software. Once again, digital tools allowed an increased customisation of the offer in order to better fit with the particularities of each point of sale including customer expectations and physical constraints and merchandising agreements negotiated with brands. Each time a new perfume or skincare reference is launched, store managers receive updated plans. Eventually, the new merchandising tool led to a better store presentation, improved conformity scores, and significant efficiency gains in product handling. It also allowed the retailer and the brands to get access to more factual data."
Tradeshows: MakeUp in and Luxe Pack announce partnership,"""This merger with the Infopro Digital Group offers a synergy between the Luxe Pack and MakeUp In trade shows, which will enable to extend the footprint of these events internationally in several countries wishing to host them,"" explain Sandra Maguarian and Jean-Yves Bourgeois, who co-founded Beauteam in 2008, together with Vincent Gallon. This acquisition enables Infopro Digital to expand its events portfolio in the cosmetics sector while it will help Beauteam to consolidate the past pace development of MakeUp in events in outside Europe, in particular in Asia and Brazil. The “MakeUp in” events gather suppliers and subcontractors of the makeup and skincare industry, including packaging and application tools makers, formulators and raw material companies.  Every two months, the shows welcome between 2,000 and 3,000 professional visitors from the main makeup and beauty brands around the world. Infopro Digital has developed several BtoB trade shows in the luxury and packaging sectors, such as Luxe Pack Monaco, Luxe Pack New York, Luxe Pack Shanghai and Pack & Gift. The two companies say they share common values, which brought them together: “quality and passion for beauty and luxury along with the desire to organize high quality events where leaders and decision makers from Marketing, R&D and Purchasing Departments meet with a desire to put business first."" ""We are delighted with this merger,"" said Christophe Czajka, Executive Chairman and founder of Digital Infopro, ""synergies between the teams will further increase our power of action in these trades and the sector. They will enable to offer professionals the best in terms of expertise, and this, whatever the country."" Beauteam management and employees will join the Infopro Digital team in its offices in Antony in the southern outskirts of Paris. Sandra Maguarian has spent her entire career organizing trade shows. She successively worked as Show Manager of the International Leather Show in France and as co-manager of trade shows in the same sector in Asia and the United States. Later, she created a fashion fair in the south of France before joining the Cosmoprof’s office in Paris. In 2008, she co-created Beauteam. Jean-Yves Bourgeois devoted its entire career to trade media, successively as a journalist, a publisher and a consultant with a specialization in the packaging and beauty sectors.  He was also one of the co-founders of Luxe Pack Monaco in 1988 and founder of the magazine Formes de Luxe, which now owned by the Infopro Digital group.  He will continue to oversee the development of the MakeUp in tradeshows as a consultant for Infopro Digital. It should also be noted that, although initially integrated into Beauteam, PremiumBeautyNews.com, which was created in 2008 by Jean-Yves Bourgeois, Sandra Maguarian and Vincent Gallon, was sold to Premium Beauty Media and Vincent Gallon in 2012.  The site is not concerned by this transaction and remains fully independent. The next ""MakeUp in"" tradeshow will be held in Seoul on 5 and 6 April 2017. Recently renamed MakeUp in Asia, it should become itinerant in 2018 and move to Shanghai or Tokyo."

Cosmopolitan supports the development of rare perfumes in Brazil,"It is a long-term job that is starting to bear fruit. Launched in 2012, Cristiane Vilar’s project, which aims to make Brazilian consumers discover rare perfumes, had first materialized in the opening of a showroom store in the federal capital in June 2015. “Our store in Brazilia is much more than a point of sale,” explains Cristiane Vilar, founder and manager of Cosmopolitan do Brasil. “It is a place dedicated to training and discovery. We train retailers and introduce them to brands and products.” It should be said that if Brazilians are major perfume consumers, niche perfumery was almost completely unknown on this market before Cosmopolitan was created. “We had to put a lot of effort into communication, education, and explanations at first,” Cristiane Vilar emphasizes. “But we soon noticed there was a real interest. We got a lot of coverage in the press, and several distributors approached us. Just like in any country, distributors look for new products.” Cosmopolitan can also rely on the transformation of the perfumes and cosmetics distribution network in Brazil. With Sephora entering the market in 2012 and multibrand chain The Beauty Box created by the Boticário group, the market situation changed, as consumers’ purchase habits got transformed. “In all big Brazilian cities, there are small selective distribution networks trying to differentiate themselves from Sephora and The Beauty Box, but also online stores, a few of which are fed by smuggling networks,” Cristiane Vilar explains. As a matter of fact, the company identified about 500 perfume stores likely to distribute this type of products, before making a first selection, depending on the quality of the points of sale. “Owners have really warmly welcomed us. There was a genuine curiosity for the products we offer, but very limited, even inexistent knowledge in niche perfumery. We had to train them a lot.” As regards this aspect, in Brazil and elsewhere, brands’ storytelling is a key factor of success. In addition to its showroom store in Brasilia and online store, today Cosmopolitan has about ten clients all around Brazil, including in the north-east of the country, which is still little explored by major distributors. “I strongly believe in the potential of Nordeste, which consumes three times more perfumes per person than the southern part of the country. But they are really used to light hesperidia perfumes,” Cristiane Vilar specifies. However, according to Cosmopolitan’s creator, consumers are really open to new products. “They like being surprised and enjoy originality. They will know how to make a difference between a precious, particular perfume intended for special occasions, and a perfume worn on a daily basis.” If the Brazilian market is very promising, it is important to be aware of its limits and difficulties. Beyond educating consumers, registration procedures and costs, duties, and various other taxes result in delays and significant extra costs. According to Cristiane Vilar, nationalization costs lead to a rise in products’ final selling price of 30 to 40%. “It can take time to get sales results, which is why we only select brands that have enough financial strength.” For the moment, Cosmopolitan do Brasil has chosen to work only with French brands, by offering an olfactory journey between perfumery from the region of Provence (Au Pays de la Fleur d’Oranger, Molinard), and historic and contemporaneous Parisian perfumery (Frapin, E. Coudray, Téo Cabanel, Institut Très Bien, Berdoues Grands Crus, etc.). We will be there to follow their adventure!"
"“2017 also promises a great speed-up for us” - Xavier Chauvin, Co-founder and CEO of Beauteprivee","“We have never ceased growing, but it is true things have been speeding up for two years, due to the addition of convergent factors,” explains Xavier Chauvin, who has identified three main levers. A favourable market environment Most women consumers want new, innovative, and/or foreign brands. And yet, if these expectations are largely relayed by social networks, they are relatively absent from traditional channels, which makes them turn to online stores. “Brands’ communication channels have tremendously changed, and some of the least visible through the usual media channels actually show very strong records on our website,” the manager comments. Beauteprivee plays a role in identifying these eagerly awaited brands, by offering them to a base of more than three million subscribers open to new launches. “To us, the predefinition of the typology of brands associated with a network is not necessarily relevant, given what our customers expect,” he adds. The rise of mobile devices Consumption habits are changing. Shopping on mobile devices is now fully integrated to simplified environments. As a matter of fact, in 2016, the traffic on the mobile version of Beauteprivee outperformed that of the desktop version, and the volume of business rose by 160% on this medium. “We have been working on this aspect since 2011, whether in terms of application or mobile-dedicated environment. It is this experience that is helping us grow so fast and strong today,” Xavier Chauvin explains. The accuracy of the media system implemented Lastly, there is a third key element, according to Xavier Chauvin: measuring the performance of the communication campaigns launched. “It helps us be quite incisive and relevant as regards our choices, both online and offline, and adjust shrewd arbitrations on the environments on which we intend to be present,” he explains. Present in France and Spain with a base of over 3 million subscribers, Beauteprivee now intends to build on their success, by pursuing their initial strategy. “We keep working on our ability to attract new brands for women in search of wonderful beauty stories. There will also be most significant changes in how we do our job, regarding issues like mobile devices, product recommendation, personalization, and customer knowledge. We have endless opportunities now, but also major challenges ahead for players like us,” Xavier Chauvin concludes."
From trends analysis to full implementation of the concept: IL Cosmetics’ 360° approach,"Premium Beauty News - Obviously, you want to anticipate the rebound that seems to be shaping up in the nail polish industry. Jean-François Harpes - That’s right! All indicators are gradually going green... As you know, the nail polish market is subject to regular cycles. The ""boom"", which started with the current decade, gradually slowed down, but under the influence of a sharp come back of colour and with the new, more sophisticated, attractive and fun nail polish ranges, recovery seems to be around the corner. So we must be prepared to meet this demand. Our historical industrial site in Luxembourg was modernized and its capacity increased during the past three years. A new R & D centre was built. We also decided to further increase our filling capacity by doubling our Polish factory with the opening a new production site in Bulgaria. This site will also offer a oversized logistics platform. This new unit will be operational next year and will condition twice as much nail polish but also all other products in our make-up range, especially mascara and lipgloss. Premium Beauty News - A market strategy that is consistent with this strong trend towards more full service? Jean-François Harpes - Clearly, Full service is nothing less than a tidal wave. Full Service or Turnkey now represents 80% of our turnover, while 10 years ago it only accounted for 35-40%. It’s obviously the path to follow in the future. The market today demands innovation and quality, timeliness and competitiveness. Moreover, and always at the request of Brands, subcontractors - we are part of - have become real product designers. We must be able to analyse cycles and trends, predict future best sellers, develop new products, control formulation and colours, to supply and sometimes develop in coordination with manufacturers innovative packs, to assist in the creation of the required displays, to condition and to take care of project management and logistics. All this in the shortest possible deadline and with a high-quality level. The concept of ""time to market"" is a key element for success. When you simply imagine that in many cases, delays are reduced to two months for products and concepts developed by us. It is therefore necessary to implement important means in R&D (which we did!), have an efficient industrial process allowing us to quickly produce with an uncompromising level of quality with a very competitive cost offer. And in addition, our customers also ask us more and more to do the final packaging in presentation boxes, and even design for them the presentation displays. Premium Beauty News - This is explained by the development of small and medium brands, of distributors and Internet brands? Jean-François Harpes - Yes of course! These new players are looking for suppliers who have an overall ability to manage projects from A to Z. By directly relying on the subcontracting producer in full service, they reduce intermediaries and maximize their chance of success. These new customers submit us new projects every day. And this is of course one of the reasons why we decided to increase our capacity, because we also believe in a strong recovery of nail polish consumption in the coming months."
Cosmetic Valley wants to expand its influence in France and around the world,"The strategic plan presented by both Directors is divided into ten main points: – Restructuring the cluster to reach a critical mass. The number of members of the Cosmetic Valley increased tenfold in ten years, to reach 460 contributing companies in late 2016. These companies represent a large share of the turnover generated by all the industry’s players (26 billion euros out of an estimated 30 billion). However, Marc-Antoine Jamet considers the potential is not exploited everywhere, as 1,500 to 2,000 companies may still be tempted to join. As a result, he plans to get rid of the initial regional boundaries, and restructure the organization by adopting new statutes, so that any company, wherever it is based, may become a member. – Getting the network global. The process was initiated in 2016, with the launch of the Cosmetics Cluster International Network, which gathers 17 international clusters today, and will enter its operational phase in 2017. The network aims to pool both services and information and help companies develop on the global level. In addition, the Cosmétopée project for the preservation of plants and traditional know-how initiated by Jean-Luc Ansel is now integrated to the “Sud Expert Plantes” programme, which gathers 22 countries. – Establishing a plural Made in France movement. The idea is to keep going with the implementation of DESTs (fields of territorial strategic excellence) on the new areas of competence of the regions, to better highlight the values of the Marque France (performance, safety, environmental protection). In practical terms, the aim is to initiate research projects in these territories, like the Open Lab Cosmetomics in Cergy Pontoise, in the suburbs of Paris, the Certesens research and studies centre on sensorial technologies in the city of Tours, or Cosmetolab in Evreux. – Supporting research dynamics. By pursuing the Cosmetosciences programme, the Cosmetic Valley] aims to place science and universities at the core of the exchanges with the private sector. The objective is to pool synergies. Among others, scientific workshops will be organized every three months with a university. The first will be held soon at the Parisian university of Jussieu – the theme is yet to be defined. – Making companies commit to an innovation process. The cluster intends to enhance innovation in SMEs/microbusinesses by providing individual, regular support, and facilitating exchanges via the Cosmetup platform. Since it was founded two years ago, 50 SME and entrepreneur projects have been supported. – Organizing multiple events. As a desire to share knowledge and provide professionals with training programmes, the annual schedule of congresses, colloquia, and debates was enriched to reach seven events this year. – Becoming a supervisor… by making the Regulatory Congress, a major annual event in Chartres, south-west of Paris, designed to favour both control and knowledge of national and global regulations, an instrument to produce standards. – Supporting SMEs at major international shows. The major international shows at which the Cosmetic Valley supports French companies constitute another example of events essential to the development of the industry. The association will be a special guest at the China Beauty Expo 2017 and will take part in In-Cosmetics Global in London, Beauty World Middle East in Dubai, and Cosmoprof Asia in Hong Kong. Until now, the cluster shared this mission with BUSINESSFRANCE, but now they would like to take care of it themselves, by signing an agreement. – Encouraging digital development and Beauty Tech. Determined to encourage research projects in the digital field, the cluster will accelerate the Beautytech programme in September 2017 to help the industry’s start-ups develop abroad and lay the foundations of a Cosmetics Big Data Hub. – Boosting innovation with the Cosmetic 360 show. As a major player in the industry re-emerging on the international scale, the Cosmetic Valley intends to make Cosmetic 360 a weighty event on the global level. As a showcase for innovation, the key theme of the show since it was created in 2015, it will be reinforced in 2017 with more diverse exhibitors, by adding innovative solutions from other business areas like the food or digital industries. On top of that, this year, an 800m2 area will be dedicated to the creativity of start-ups."

"Aptar, Verescence, DuPont Corian: manufacturers in the wake of the Grand Musée du Parfum","A great perfume cannot go without its glass bottle. Both share a common history: how is it possible not to feature the case with the juice? Originally, the project managers of the Grand Musée du Parfum contacted Verescence, global leader of glass bottle manufacturing for perfumes and cosmetics, whose directors immediately showed their enthusiasm to get involved as a partner. “This initiative was obviously an excellent opportunity for us, as it perfectly corresponded to our will to share our glassmaking know-how with as many people possible, and in such a prestigious venue,” explains Astrid Dulau-Vuillet, International Marketing Manager of Verescence. Now, Verescence demonstrates their expertise with creations exhibited on all floors, as well as visuals and videos on bottle manufacturing. Almost 500 bottles are showcased in different settings, including those made in premium Xtra Blanc glass, reflecting the manufacturer’s innovation skills. “This partnership involves much effort. We have worked hand in hand with the museum’s teams, who put a lot into the project to offer a new way to present perfumery,” Astrid Dulau-Vuillet adds. “We are very proud of the result, as it conveys our passion for our trade, which embodies French excellence.” Perfumery also involves a gesture, a ritual. To deal with the act of wearing perfume, the Museum approached Aptar, a supplier packaging and dispensing solution for cosmetics and perfumes. They did not hesitate a second to get involved. “This type of project is completely new for us as a BtoB company, but it suited our vision of the perfumery industry. There is much to do in terms of passing on our knowledge,” explains Sabine Bouillet Lubot, Strategic Marketing Manager Fragrance of the group. “The sensorial, interactive approach, the experience and ambition of the Museum to raise people’s awareness of the world of perfumes really convinced us. It is important to educate and develop the passion this theme creates in people,” she adds. Like all partners, the company has agreed to provide financial support over a period of five years. The objective is to illustrate their know-how in several ways, in line with their creed: “one fragrance, one gesture”. On the one hand, Aptar got involved in the artistic project of the room dedicated to the art of wearing perfume: a video and photo creation made by three artists and inspired from the quotations of renowned perfume creator Jean-Claude Ellena about “gestes des odeurs” (smell gestures), as well as data and observations Aptar was able to take from his studies conducted all around the world. On the other hand, the manufacturer made its dispensing systems available to the museum, including the new “La Petite” spray, which can be found on the 60 bottles featured on the large stairs, as well as the “Eternelle Couture” bulb atomizers, chosen to activate a digital content. “Thanks to this partnership, we have the opportunity to give more value to the gesture of perfuming, which has become quite banal,” emphasizes Sabine Bouillet Lubot. As part of their perfume-oriented activity, the Aptar group has developed a range of diffusion systems which, given its diversity and sophisticated sensoriality, helps choose the most appropriate gesture, depending on the perfume concept, whether it be a spray or an alternative gesture like a bulb or the new Note product, which revives the gesture of a direct skin application. “There are thousands of ways to wear perfume. They depend on many things, the perfume, but also the region of the world, the culture, the climate… We would like to convince our customers it is important to think about the perfume gesture they will associate with their new concept, right at the beginning,” Sabine Bouillet Lubot ensures. DuPont did not hesitate either when they were asked to become a partner of the Jardin des Senteurs (Garden of Scents) of the Museum. Designed by the Projectiles agency as a field of flowers, this area stimulates the smell with an immersion in the middle of organic creations made with Corian resin. “The way our material is used is very innovative. Already recognized by creators and the general public for its sensual touch and aesthetics, here, it is associated with scents,” comments Alessandra Sabatey, Communication Officer of Corian. With the collaboration of transformer Créa Diffusion, DuPont Corian took on the technical challenge this creation represented with a meticulous, original transformation of their panels. “As a manufacturer, we are not used to this kind of experience. But here, highlighted as a museum work of art, Corian has gone out of their comfort zone to show themselves in a different way likely to seduce the world of perfume,” Alessandra Sabatey asserts. Alongside industrials, different perfume brands also committed to financially support the museum, like The Different Company: “We are delighted to support the first major initiative on Perfumery in Paris. The Grand Musée du Parfum offers a modern, aesthetic, detailed visit filled with olfactory emotions and creations. It is the place to be!” guarantees Luc Gabriel, President of the brand, whose Rose Poivrée fragrance composed by Jean-Claude Ellena in 2002 was also selected by the scientific committee to be part of the five roses of perfumer-artists offered to visitors on the Blossom installation, an “Imaginary Rosebush” created by Violette Houto, designer."
Seppic enlarges its portfolio of natural active ingredients with the acquisition of Serdex,"Building on the 2013 acquisition of BiotechMarine, a company based on France’s west coast and specializing in natural substances from marine resources for cosmetics manufacturers, the acquisition of Serdex adds new natural ingredients to Seppic’s portfolio, increasing its offer to meet the expectations of consumers for natural products. According to Seppic, global sales of specialty active ingredients for cosmetics amount to over EUR 900 million, of which natural active ingredients are a fast growing segment. From this point of view, Serdex had many assets to interest Seppic. Specialising in botanical active ingredients for dermo-cosmetics and skin treatment, Serdex achieved a turnover of EUR 8 million in 2015.  With its 40 employees, based in Pau, South-West France, Serdex brings to Seppic its expertise in high purity extraction, in sourcing of exotic plants, and its knowledge of Malagasy plants notably. “With this acquisition, Air Liquide strengthens its position in the market of active ingredients of natural origin, meeting the high and increasing demand of consumers for these ingredients. The complementarity of Serdex and Seppic allows us to widen our know-how to better serve our beauty care customers and continue the development of this eco-responsibly sourced active ingredients activity,” said François Jackow, member of the Air Liquide group’s Executive Committee, supervising the Healthcare activities. Present in over 100 countries through its affiliates and network of distributors, Seppic employs 660 people aroundthe world, including 100 employees dedicated to innovation."
"“L’Occitane au Brésil shows a great potential for export,” Nicolas Geiger, L’Occitane do Brasil","Premium Beauty News - How are the group’s brands doing in Brazil? Nicolas Geiger - Today, L’Occitane en Provence is a well-developed brand that keeps growing: 10% last year, and probably the same this year. That is a good result, bearing in mind that the number of stores is stable. There are already about a hundred of them, and it is hard to open any more, given the number of premium shopping malls in the country. However, L’Occitane au Brésil has changed a lot. We will open about 50 points of sale before the end of December. There will be 180 next March, including 150 kiosks and about 30 stores. Premium Beauty News - How can you explain this performance on a market that is slowing down? Nicolas Geiger - We are one of the three main players on the premium cosmetics market in Brazil, but it should not be forgotten that this market represents 5% of the total beauty market, and it is much less competitive. With 5 to 10% of market share, we are still small, and it is always easier to grow when we are small. Premium Beauty News - A growing network, a retail concept redesigned with the Cent Degrés agency… What part does the boom of L’Occitane au Brésil represent in these results? Nicolas Geiger - L’Occitane au Brésil grows by 100% every year, which is a good pace on a market with less than 5% growth. We feel that the brand is very well-accepted. Actually, we launched L’Occitane au Brésil as a solution not to depend only on imported products, but also to pay tribute to the Brazilian cosmetics culture. Our marketing positioning and offering correspond to the Brazilian profile. If the brand was originally inspired from L’Occitane en Provence concept, today, it has its own identity, and quite an exciting way to talk about Brazil. Now, that is important within a context of political and identity crisis. In addition, it is the “gringo”, the foreigner, who talks about the beauty, richness, and Brazilian culture with such passion. Brazilians like it, they are proud of that. Premium Beauty News - When will we see L’Occitane au Brésil outside of Brazil? Nicolas Geiger - We sincerely think this brand, and more generally Brazil or the “made in Brazil” concept, has a great potential for export. Local players have not managed to meet the challenge of penetrating global markets with quality products. Today, we are able to do it, but before that, we need to be strong at home, meaning in Brazil, and in particular to keep developing our own personality. When the brand finds its balance here, we will go global. It is a project we have been studying from an opportunistic standpoint, but for now, we mainly aim to make it a Brazilian brand that can be autonomous in Brazil. Premium Beauty News - Two years ago, you claimed you wanted to make Brazil the main market of the L’Occitane group. For now, it is still the 7th: do you maintain your objective? Nicolas Geiger - It is still the 7th indeed, but we should take into account the depreciation of the real. In terms of local money, we have grown by 30 or 40%, and with a 20.5% growth in the first semester 2016, from April to October, Brazil represents 55% of the group’s global growth. So, indeed, we aim to make it the first market, but we will still need three to five years before it becomes reality. At least, being part of the top 3 is possible, and it can also go very fast if L’Occitane au Brésil keeps growing, or even exporting."
The Alkos Group organizes the continuation of its growth,"Actually, the year 2016 was a busy one for the Alkos Group: its visual identity was redesigned, the construction of a new plant for its subsidiary Inter Cosmétiques was decided, a new General Manager joined the company and, eventually, its shareholding structure was reorganized to support ambitious growth targets. Let’s recall the Group’s history. In 1998, Gérard Gieux, founder of Cosmogen, a French manufacturer of cosmetic packaging and applicators, acquired Alkos Cosmétiques, a manufacturer of cosmetic pencils, then two other companies in 2008, Intercosmétiques (make-up and skincare products) and Sagal (hygiene products), eventually gathered within the Alkos Group. In 2014, to fund an ambitious investment program, Gérard Gieux had called on equity fund MBO Partneraires, which became the majority shareholder (51%) of a holding company gathering Cosmogen and the Alkos Group. At the end of November 2016, this holding company was reorganized with the separation of the Cosmogen entity, which was fully taken over by MBO Partenaires. The transaction allowed Gérard Gieux to increase its stake in the Alkos Group by taking over the majority of the capital (75%), MBO becoming a minority shareholder. Furthermore, the proceeds from the sale of Cosmogen allowed Alkos Group to repay all of its senior debt and to consider the continuation of its investment program with ease. ""Gérard Gieux, the Group’s historic industrial shareholder, thus demonstrates his confidence in the strategy being pursued by the management team. With his experience, he will support key executives and shareholders including Dominique Vautier, CEO, and Philippe Pavageau, the newly arrived GM,"" the company said in a statement. The management team thus has the means to carry out an ambitious organic growth strategy, leveraging on the 40% increase in capacity brought by the construction of the new plant in Angers (an investment of 8.5 million euros), on the development of innovative products and on international growth. The target of the shareholders is thus to increase the group’s turnover from 60 million euros to 100 million euros over the next 5 years. ""The group still achieves a large part of its turnover in France, we have a big potential for growth in export markets,"" explains Florence Lefeuvre, Sales, Marketing and Communication Director of the Alkos Group. North America and South America remain priority targets for the Group which has just opened a sales office in New York and will participate for the first time in the MakeUp in Sao Paulo trade show on 7 and 8 December 2016. However, the Group does not exclude the possibility that acquisitions will reinforce this organic strategy, in particular in the event of opportunities to complement its product portfolio or to facilitate the implementation in foreign markets. ""Our customers and long-term partners are encouraging us to enter the powder segment. This could also be part of an international implementation,"" explains Florence Lefeuvre. The group would have already identified potential targets and some options would have been investigated in detail, particularly in North America. To be continued!"
Crystalmoda doubles its turnover,"Dario Moretti, the Head and main shareholder of the Company, has every reason to be satisfied. After deciding in 2013 to divest to the Lumson Group its packaging activity, Modapack to concentrate solely on the development of Crystalmoda, his efforts have paid off. The firm currently employs more than fifty people and expects to achieve net sales of EUR 12 million during the current year. The volume of investments remains strong. ""We are investing in all areas of the Company: the workforce, the laboratory, production equipment and filling lines,"" explains Dario Moretti. In recent months, Crystalmoda has strengthened its offering in terms of lip products and liquid foundations, even if powders remain the main activity. The 5000 m2 plant produces some several million pieces per year of make-up powders. ""Powders are at present still our core business,"" explains Dario Moretti, ""but we have significantly increased our production capacity of lipgloss, mascara and lipstick.” Over the last six months the company invested more than EUR 600 000. As for the Group’s international expansion, it can only increase.  ""The Canadian Group Crystal Claire Cosmetics recently acquired a stake in our capital,"" says Dario Moretti. “And we will set up together a development strategy in the coming weeks. To note that we are doing also very well on new Middle East markets.” Main objective for the Italian firm, also strengthen its presence at the level of major European brands."
Tre Effe to invest EUR 3 million in a new plant,"Tre Effe, a company that does not get itself much talked about is led by the Ferracini family, (the father, Gianni and his daughters, Federica and Francesca). The company was created in 1995 and it can boast a steady and consistent growth in the segment of make-up products.  With a commercial foothold in Europe but also the United States, the Middle East and Russia, the company will achieve this year a turnover of 7 million euros for a total staff of 30 people. Excellent results that allow the company to invest significantly for 2017, a year during which it will move into a 4000 m2 building located in the same area as the current 1000 m2 plant. Three million euros will have been invested in the operation, part of which also serving to increase the bulk production capacity. ""To note, emphasises Alistair Beavan, General Manager, that Tre Effe produces mainly powders (75% of the production, that is, about 700 kilos per day), including baked powders, but also lipsticks, mascaras and eyeliners (total capacity: 2,500 pcs/h)."""
Intercos: More than ever the originator and world leader of a winning concept,"With a turnover that will near EUR 500 million, with a double digit growth compared to last year, the Italian Group, the world leader in its field, should have every reason to be satisfied of this 2016 year coming to a close. ""In fact, yes and no,  admits Dario Ferrari. Indeed while the first six months were up to our expectations, the economic slowdown perceived during the second half of the year surprised us and was more important than what we had then expected. But I must stress on one point, it is not the global market which came to a standstill - because it actually increased - but more the positions of the main players in this market - those who do large volumes - which were totally unsettled. Some of these heavy weight players saw their business drop significantly while small and medium players were progressing very quickly, some of them posting conspicuous growth rates, boosted by internet sales and with the help and influence of bloggers and followers. In the US too, traditional retail channels also saw their sales drop sharply. Speed to market, innovation, quick line turnovers have become key watchwords if you want to stay in the race."" As a consequence, traditional industrial and business models have been undermined.  ""Because we must never forget,  insists Dario Ferrari, that we’re doing a complex job that involves multiple parameters not always compatible in terms of raw materials, industrial processes, equipments implemented, packagings, required levels of quality and short delivery deadlines. Hence we are in a constant race against time, orders have diversified, requirements for innovation and deadlines have increased. You must excel everywhere and quickly, you must anticipate the next turn when you aren’t even done with the previous one."" With its 13 factories and 4000 employees around the world, acting as genuine trend ""sensors"", the Italian Group considers itself, with good reasons too, in the best position to anticipate, adapt better and faster to these changes.  ""This vision is not a gift of God,  explains Dario Ferrari, it is acquired on the ground where things happen and with the players who are already in anticipation of the day after"". Another proof of this anticipative strategy: the brand new 12000 m2 factory of the Italian Group that is being built from the ground up, in South Korea in the outskirts of Seoul and which will be operational next January. A major investment in an expanding area of the world. ""South Korea is the place in Asia where things are happening, insists Dario Ferrari. The market is in China, but excellence and innovation, speed of implementation and flexibility are in South Korea."" Flexibility and reactivity, key words at the close of the year. ""Produce globally, but act locally are essential for a Group like ours, to not only maintain its leadership but, above all, continue to gain market shares,"" he explains. ""You must also keep track of currency fluctuations, to be able to transfer whatever production in the most competitive part of the world. With the dollar in a rising phase again, we did not hesitate to repatriate some productions to Italy. Especially as our home country has both the know-how in terms of staff and that much desired and required flexibility"". The market is demanding more full service, additional skills and more resources, including in the packaging area...  That’s no problem, the Head of Intercos is convinced that a better integration upstream will be increasingly important. ""The whole question, he wonders, is how to get organised, with whom and where?"" Anticipate future market demands... a true second nature for the Intercos leader. "" Retailer private brands  have been gaining ground and this trend is bound to continue, he explains, we have therefore decided to set up a dedicated structure, Intercos Concept, which will be in charge of supporting our customers with 360° marketing skills. A team with the necessary experience to develop concepts and product ranges, but also do merchandising and communication operations, exchange with bloggers, and so on. We recently appointed Renato Semerari [1] to manage the new structure. The objective: define our marketing approach ’on the field’ for a more successful development and launch of our new product lines."""
Omnicos: A new factory in 2017,"Over a 8000 m2 area that will see the light in May next. A particularly important investment for this Italian company that relies a lot on 360° technology investments. ""These new buildings will actually be home to all the company sites currently spread over several sites in Romanengo,"" explained Manuela Guerrini, Sales Manager.  ""It concerns offices, laboratories and workshops and a fully automated storage area"". A second tranche of 12,000 m2 is scheduled late 2018/early 2019: it will be home to the filling and conditioning workshop. Main products manufactured: foundations, mascaras, lipsticks, lip glosses, eyeliners and, since a few months, automatic pencils and powders.  ""We are also going to implement our third production line for automatic pencils,"" underlined Manuela Guerrini. ""90 % of the company’s turnover comes from export sales, primarily to France, Germany, but also the Middle East and the United States, a market which is starting to give us a lot of satisfaction,"" explained Manuela Guerrini. Another asset of the company is its ability to create its own filling and automated machines thanks its participation in the partner-Company, IDM Automation located near Milan."
"""Innovation and R&D are key assets in colour cosmetics,"" IL Cosmetics","Premium Beauty News - How is the nail polish market doing? Jean-François Harpes - The nail polish market itself is rather ""flat"" not to say declining. In this context we can observe a ""streamlining"" of the market around two major global players. Indeed, the manufacture of nail polish requires both heavy investments and high expertise. Brands must rely on specialized suppliers. We are delighted to see that IL Cosmetics is gaining market share. Today we are the European market leaders and the number two worldwide in the nail polish segment. We are also taking advantage of our diversification in the make-up category with our Luxcos division, which is one of the leaders in the mascara segment, with also a strong growth in the lip segment, particularly for long wear and liquid lipsticks. In 2016, we expect our turnover in make-up to grow by more than 45%. Premium Beauty News - How do you explain this impressive growth? Jean-François Harpes - Our investments in research and innovation, these past five years, have certainly helped propel IL Cosmetics as the new leader on the European market. Today, we invest 5% of our turnover in R&D. In our labs a total 85 people are dedicated to research, development and quality, with 45 of them exclusively involved in research on nail polish. In practice, our research teams are dedicated to each product category: formulation for nail polishes and make-up, colour, special effects, nail care, new technologies... We have also renewed and extended our collaboration with the LIST (Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology), the leading research institute in Luxembourg. A dedicated team of 10 people works specifically on improving organoleptic parameters such as brightness, staying power and of course stability. Their scientific and highly analytical work has led to many advances. These technology breakthroughs have led to the conclusion of a number of contracts in premium markets, such as France, UK and Korea where our market shares have quadrupled in five years. And our constant growth also results from improvements in our consumer panel techniques, which are mostly performed in-house. This allows us to speed up our time to market approach and to increase the number of formulas and concepts developed simultaneously. This panel is a key tool to continuously improve our formulas sensory parameters, to guarantee a perfect match between our results and those of our customers and to know the purchasing intentions of our different formulas and concepts. Finally, it allows us a more qualitative approach concerning future consumer requirements. Premium Beauty News - Precisely, what do you see as the major upcoming trends in the nail polish market? Jean-François Harpes -  According to a consumer study we conducted recently and to forecasts on the fashion sector, the trend is for a return of colour, with colour hold remaining an unavoidable feature along with formulas enabling to stage colours. We are working on new technologies to highlight these key consumer parameters: gloss - thanks to a patented proprietary technology -, brightness, radiance, and a second generation gel texture. Consumers regard the staying power as a key element in assessing quality. Note that in almost all tests related to the staying power, performed by our clients we were well ahead our competitors. This is why it is important to have a perfect mastery of the gel technology, which is also a great source of inspiration to innovate and optimize the traditional nail polish technology. For each season, we will showcase collections in line with these trends. Hence we invite our customers to visit us at the upcoming Cosmoprof Asia trade show that will be held in Hong Kong from 16 to 18 November 2016, to discover our latest innovations. We will exhibit in the Convention & Exhibition Center - hall 3G- stand K2B."
Formulas: The multi ethnic make-up strategy of Necos,"Premium Beauty News - You’re not the only one to have embarked on this adventure of ethnic and Halal products in particular? Dario Dall’Oste -  True, but we’re the only ones to have built a Halal certified factory! And that’s what makes the difference! But as the saying goes, “he who can do more can do less”! It is clear that this brand new plant, which is in the process of being GMP, Halal and ISO 9001 certified and that we have just commissioned in the outskirts of Crema in Italy enables us mostly to have a global market reach where there is a majority of consumers with dark skins or in any case, very coloured skins. Imagine, for example, that in London “white people” only represent 40% of the population. Imagine that in thirty years the majority of the U.S. population will no longer consist of white people. Imagine that the 17 ASEAN countries are in the process of implementing a Halal certification, which should see the light in 2018. Don’t forget that more than 620 million people live in this area. Finally, imagine that 42% of Colombian women use between nine and twelve cosmetic products daily. Premium Beauty News - Impressive indeed! Quite enough to make the mouths of cosmetic suppliers water. Dario Dall’Oste -  Yes, but it is far from simple! Obtaining the Halal certification for a production plant is an obstacle course. You almost need to start with a ‘white’ sheet of paper (if I can say so!). Everything must be certified. Ingredients and raw materials of course, but also cleaning products for the production equipment, not to mention the staff’s whole immediate working environment. The 2500 m2 plant, which started running last July is part of a two-million-euro investment and produces per year about 70 tonnes of mascara, 70 tonnes of foundation, 19 tonnes of lipgloss and lipsticks and 75 tonnes of powders. We can offer a total of 126 certified Halal formulas, also complying with several much demanded marketing claims in “traditional” markets for natural and vegetarian products. We already have several agents representing us in our most strategic markets. And by the end of next year, we are planning to build a filling plant in Eastern Europe spanning on a 3000 m2 area. Premium Beauty News - The growing number of mestizos obviously represents a great potential! Dario Dall’Oste -  This is why I must stress on the purposefully multiethnic positioning of Necos. The Indian Beauty market is growing by 20% annually and 50% of its population is under 30 years of age. In five years, Iran will be the fourth largest cosmetic market. Iranian women use one mascara every month and a lipstick every month and a half. And any way a carefully devised formula development activity sticking to the needs of existing markets and not just to the ones this inexorable globalisation trend is going to offer us more and more in the future, allows us to have high performance products also for Caucasian skins, which enabled Necos to win its first customers in Italy, UK, Eastern Europe and Australia."
Kanebo Cosmetics turns 80 and launches new brand around the world,"Since its acquisition by the Kao Group in 2006, Kanebo Cosmetics has undergone a real transformation. Product ranges were streamlined, and teams and sites were integrated. Last September, Kao inaugurated the group’s new R&D centre in Odawara (Kanagawa Prefecture), one of Kanebo’s historical sites. The group’s research and development teams are now gathered in these new labs inspired by the principles of kansei engineering. Kanebo, a textile company founded in the late 19th century, launched its first cosmetic product in 1936. It consisted in a soap made of silk fibres and thereafter named Savon de Soie. Ten years later, in 1946, Kanebo launched its first cold cream: it is the first huge success for the group’s cosmetics division that will gradually diversify its products to become one of the giants of the Japanese market. In 1966, the group officially opened its Paris office and laboratory. ""At that time, the aim was to build on the French and European know-how to stand out in the Japanese market by offering innovative solutions,"" said Hiroaki Katsukura, the current Director of the Paris office. This initiative quickly proved successful with the launch in Japan of several new products directly inspired by the Parisian laboratory and with some of these launches meeting big commercial success. In 1983, Kanebo felt strong enough to conquer the world and launched Sensai, a premium brand for international markets. Fifty years after its opening, the missions of the Kanebo the French laboratory have slightly shifted towards market and consumer insights. ""We conduct consumer research, mainly in the group’s three most important European markets: Germany, Italy and Spain,"" said Ghislaine Suquet, Product Manager at Kanebo Cosmetics Paris.  ""From Japan, Europe is sometimes viewed as a single entity, our role is to moderate this vision, to highlight the differences between the markets."" The French office can also manage some new product developments when a specific French know-how is involved, as it was the case forthe launch of Sensai’s first fragrance in 2015. Other developments may also be made locally for environmental reasons, in particular for samples or nail varnishes. Both Kanebo and Sensai are now Kao Group brands. Inspired by the principles of ""Chrono-Beauty"", the new Kanebo brand was launched in Japan in September 2016 in about 150 department stores and 200 specialty stores, with products focusing on skin care, makeup and wellness. The new Kanebo brand will be launched in Asia (excluding China) in November, before Europe and Russia where the launch is scheduled for the autumn 2017. Regarding China, the deployment of the brand is not expected before 2020. With this new brand, the Japanese group aims to carve out a solid place in the global high-end cosmetics market.

Feelunique opens first bricks-and-mortar shop in Paris,"The beauty retailer - which debuted in 2005 in the UK - now has its own physical point of sale at 35 avenue Marceau, in Paris 16th district. This new milestone in its development in France will allow the retailer to offer its customers a different shopping experience. Feelunique also opened two other stores in Boulogne-Billancourt and Neuilly-sur-Seine, in the upscale western outskirts of Paris. By the end of the year, the retail will also open another shop in Levallois-Perret. All the four new brick-and-mortar stores are the result of the rebranding of beauty retail chain Rive Droite that Feelunique acquired in November 2015. Thanks to these bricks-and-mortar shop, Feelunique also complies with current regulations regarding selective distribution in the perfumery sector, which should logically facilitate the diversification of its portfolio and references, a key factor of success to attract French consumers who are more loyal than others to leading prestige beauty brands.  So far, Feelunique was only operating shops in the Channel Islands, in Jersey and Guernsey. The 100m2 Feeleunique beauty outlet brings together a wide range of iconic perfumery brands including classic and selected niche brands. To help customers during their shopping experience and give them access to the whole Feelunique offering, shop assistants are equipped with iPads. Customers can therefore choose and order products from the 20 000 items and 450 brands already available on the e-shop (fragrance, bath & body, hair skin, makeup, brows, sun & tan, healthy living, electricals, gifts ...).

Brazilian company Lipson is investing heavily in make-up,"During the past twenty-four months this 100% leading Brazilian subcontractor in beauty products has significantly accelerated the pace of its industrial investments. At the request of their customers, the company leaders decided to work twice as hard in the make-up area and to ""offer themselves"" what is best in terms of production and filling equipment. As a result, a brand new second production site of 3000 m2 on two floors, the first, dedicated to the production of powders and the second to other products (lipsticks, lipgloss, mascaras etc). Best of all, the installation of a clean room and a third storage building of 5000 m2. One of the company’s special features: aside from the latest Korean-conditioning machines recently installed in the factory, the whole engineering was developed ""in-house"". ""We are almost done,"" says Regina Helena R.T. Rodriguez, the Head of the company. ""This new production tool fully dedicated to make-up and which is already partly operational will be up and running early next year."" The entire company will be SAP managed in a few weeks and the historic factory extending over 5000 m2 will continue to be dedicated to the conditioning of perfume and hygiene products. ""A lot of foreign companies are currently calling on us to produce and condition their cosmetics,"" emphasises Regina Helena R.T. Rodriguez. ""This sector is on the rise in Brazil like elsewhere and our former production facilities were no longer sufficient to cope with demand!"""
"B. Kolormakeup & Skincare: 100% natural products, a strong strategic focus","Premium Beauty News - You have focused your strategy a lot on ""naturalness""? Mario de Luigi - It is true and we can only welcome such a move! Because it is undoubtedly a strong market demand. In fact, we have successfully managed to be able to offer our customers all our product ranges in a ""100% natural"" version. Quite a challenge believe me, which was made possible through significant investments in research and development. Don’t forget that out of a staff of about two hundred people, more than forty work in our laboratories. We are continuing to ride this so-called natural trend through the development of high performance bio products. A research work, which started ten years ago, and a source of great satisfaction and concrete orders for our company. Premium Beauty News - With ""make-up"" and ""skincare"" you are wearing two hats? Mario de Luigi - We are indeed involved in both areas. Our development and production efforts concern both, but it is true that the ""skincare"" share is significantly increasing. And as you know, the border between the two is quite thin. Premium Beauty News - You only produce in Italy? Mario de Luigi - Yes, because the ""Made in Italy"" is a real plus in our business. We mustn’t forget it. Added to the fact that everything we do is designed, produced, packaged in-house in our factories, a characteristic which guarantees a high level of quality and control. Premium Beauty News - You have planned to increase further your production capacity? Mario de Luigi -  We have no other choice! Demand continues to grow. And our 15 000 m2 production area is becoming scarce. We are a small company that offers the services and advantages of a larger structure, but with this added flexibility of small businesses that we absolutely want to preserve. We don’t want to grow for the sake of growing, we are just seeking to always meet the every need of our customers."
Faber-Castell Cosmetics: A record year,"Premium Beauty News - Can you give us some figures on your Group: How many people do you employ today, what is the turnover of the company and the main investments this year and next year in your plants, in Germany and abroad? Christina Zech -  We are 7,500 worldwide, nearly 800 of them work for Faber-Castell Cosmetics. For the Faber-Castell Group as a whole, the fiscal year 2015/16 (year ending 31st March 2016) was the best year in the company’s history with group sales of EUR 631 million (+10% year-on-year). And for the Faber-Castell Cosmetics division it was a record year as we accounted for more than 10% of Faber-Castell AG’s total business and we ended the year with double-digit sales growth and a good profit. At the moment one of our (main) focuses is to enlarge the capacity of wood cased pencils at our facility in Sao Carlos, Brazil. Since July 2013 this specially designed, modern production site offers vertical integration under one roof and is in particular beneficial for our international key accounts. And of course, a proven, standardized quality assurance system guarantees the strict compliance with all international standards. Premium Beauty News - What is today your strategy in terms of product development? Christina Zech - Step by step we are adjusting our textures to equally produce them on all our global production sites thus providing a high flexibility for us and our customers. Premium Beauty News - What are the new products? Christina Zech - At Make-Up in NewYork we presented smart solutions to create a fresh, dewy skin with a gorgeous lit-from-within-glow and stunning colours that last the whole day. And not to forget 3 new packagings, where we are especially excited about our airtight Slim Plastic Pencil. This in-house developed and produced packaging can be easily customized from “top to toe” in any colour.  Our revolution in pencil shape allows a new generation of formulas. At New York we presented it with the gel-like MAGNETIC texture which glides on like a dream and the feed-back in New York was amazing. Premium Beauty News - Concerning your future plans, what are the next steps? Christina Zech - On the whole, we strive to increase our global reach and to be closer to our customers. Furthermore, we are working on an extension of our packaging portfolio with innovative formulations which have to be especially developed for each format and as you know, this is one of our key competences. Our customers can be sure to get a “one-stop shop”: High quality products, convenience and safety where we stand behind with our reputation."
Fiabila to launch an exclusive nail polish offering on the Brazilian market,"Premium Beauty News - Over the past five years, Fiabila made considerable investments to improve its production tool and enhance its capacities, in particular by opening a plant in Brazil. What are your objectives in this country? Alexandre Miasnik -  Indeed, for the past twenty years, Fiabila has implemented a growth strategy focused on investments and on a presence on key markets, including Brazil. Today, most of our offering in this country is produced locally under conditions which, from a qualitative and regulatory standpoint, do not meet the requirements we are used to in Europe and the United States, for example. Fiabila’s objective is very clear: making radically different products available on this market and becoming the main local supplier. Premium Beauty News - The plant is now fully operational, both from the industrial and administrative standpoints. What next? Alexandre Miasnik - We are now ready to perform the color mixing and filling processes. By the end of the first semester 2017, we will be manufacturing thixotropic bases locally with extremely modern techniques, following the model used in France today and spreading across the USA. Therefore, in the short term, we will be able to offer our customers the service and flexibility resulting from our presence at the core of the Brazilian market, but also the same products and quality level as in France. Premium Beauty News - Brazil is one of the largest nail polish consumers. From a health and aesthetic point of view, your high quality product offering is quite unique on this market, which is said to be very sensitive to prices. How do you think you will convince local brands? Alexandre Miasnik - The Brazilian market’s dynamism is closely related to the low price level, which makes it possible for all social classes to buy this product. However, we have been observing a price increase in loss leaders as well as a strong growth of middle-end products. In addition, Brazil has recently strengthened their cosmetic regulation, which is getting more and more similar to what we have in Europe. This means that for all categories, the selection of raw materials and the production conditions must be adapted without any significant impact on prices. To this day, only Fiabila can answer to these constraints, while demonstrating a strong creative power. Premium Beauty News - The Brazilian economy has experienced difficulties over the past few years. Even if the beauty market is resilient, the euphoria of the early decade has disappeared. What is your perception of the market today? Alexandre Miasnik - Obviously, the market is less euphoric now, but it is still remarkably dynamic, in particular in terms of sales volumes, despite a product offering that is often limited, with a segmentation almost exclusively based on color. Today, Fiabila can make much more varied, efficient, and innovative products for Brazil, and that is key for growth."
"Absolution: The organic, chic, niche, and flourishing beauty brand steps up its development","Premium Beauty News - How would describe Absolution’s basic concept? Isabelle Carron - Offering a skincare range that can restore and maintain an optimum skin ecosystem with highly organic, unisex products boosted by the mix&match method. Premium Beauty News - Strengthened by this principle, the brand has become a reference in the world of organic cosmetics. What is the situation right now? Isabelle Carron - We are present in about 350 points of sale in 27 countries, mainly in Europe, but also in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Russia… and we have projects in Indonesia, Korea… We have worked a lot on our development in France, which represents 40% of our turnover. That is partly due to our efficient collaboration with Mama Shelter hotels for three years. Absolution has created an exclusive line of organic amenities for all their hotels, a rare achievement in the hotel business. We are gaining fame through word of mouth, although Absolution is a brand based on advice that is both appealing and destabilizing. And yet, a customer that tries is a seduced customer. As for our products, today we have 30 references, mainly in skincare, but also body care. We have also recently focused a bit on makeup, with a line of matte lipsticks created in collaboration with makeup artist Christophe Danchaud. Premium Beauty News - Talking about your makeup line, you have used crowdfunding to launch it. Why choose this approach? Isabelle Carron - Exactly. The operation was intended to launch the Sweet & Safe Kiss line in December 2014. I wanted to minimize the financial risks and test the market demand… and the public did follow us. We have exceeded our objective of EUR 30,000, which is just exceptional for the beauty sector. It helped us finance part of the production phase, and it is also an efficient communication operation, as donors become the brand and products’ ambassadors. Premium Beauty News - Are you going to keep developing your makeup offering? Isabelle Carron - Definitely, and still with Christophe Danchaud: three new sorbet lipsticks have just been launched, and eye and complexion products are under study. However, the idea is not to multiply our references, but rather to provide the perfect makeup kit for all needs. Women usually use three or four essential colours, rarely more. It is the same with skincare: I try to make beautiful, multifunctional products. Premium Beauty News - To you, is the niche cosmetics segment as dynamic as alternative perfumery? Isabelle Carron - They do not exactly grow at the same pace. The development of skincare is inherently long and tough, it is less in the spotlight, and it generates less profit margin. They do share something though, as the increasing number of launches saturates the market. Organic cosmetics are driven by the more and more popular food market, but it still has a low impact for now. In France, the problem lies in distribution. We are present in department stores, beauty salons, independent perfume stores, and through the Mademoiselle Bio network. Apart from the latter, the other organic specialized distribution networks have no high-end offering. I would like the food model to be copied in cosmetics, as there is more closeness and small stores. It is still not that easy to find an environment that truly corresponds to our brand. I have many ideas, if anyone is interested in distribution! Premium Beauty News - From a more global standpoint, what are your projects? Isabelle Carron -  We launch four new products a year, that is already a fast pace for a small company. But there is still a lot to do, and I have huge ambitions for the brand. I would like to integrate other worlds I am interested in, ingredients, food, the world of preparation. And to develop these projects, we have launched a funding process – that is the right moment for us. We are also going to focus on digital technologies and recruit people: our staff will have doubled by the end of the year, so that we will count eight employees. I wish we could live in an ethical society where people are happy. I am doing my best for it."
"“The emotional dimension is the best hope for survival for perfume stores”, Celso Fadelli, Intertrade Group","Premium Beauty News - Six years ago, as the President of the Intertrade Group, a rare perfume distributor, you decided to create the Avery Perfume Gallery concept, in a context where alternative perfumery was still a niche segment. Why? Celso Fadelli - To me, it is very important to have a direct contact with the person that uses the product and buys the perfume. It gives an opportunity to understand much more. I used to walk a small pedestrian street near Piccadilly Street in London, Avery Row, every day, and there was this small flower shop. Unfortunately, when the crisis occurred, it had to close, so I took over the lease to open our first store. It was just natural to call it Avery. The initial concept was to mark a break with traditional perfumery. The idea was to put our juices right in the heart of the area and forget about secondary packaging, the usual marketing tools. The whole decoration was made of retrieved objects bought from the Portobello market. I did not want the atmosphere to be created by a traditional design agency. Premium Beauty News - And obviously, people showed up. Celso Fadelli -  At the beginning, it was tough. No one came in, and those that did walk through the door did not understand the concept. And then, after a year and a half, it started to work well. Today, our turnover for this 20m2 store reaches 450,000 sterling pounds every year. Afterwards, we opened a second store in New Orleans, and the others followed in other cities and countries. If we count shops and corners in department stores, today we have about twenty points of sale all around the world, except in Asia. Our idea to showcase our perfumes with no packaging, marketing or communication has been copied since then by many, in particular the Belle Parfumerie at Printemps Haussmann. Our customers do not care about the brand, they care about the quality of the juice, the story of the perfume: they get to know it in a completely different way, starting with the raw material. Premium Beauty News - To you, how is the niche perfumery market evolving? Celso Fadelli - Today, there is a high demand on many markets, so we have just opened stores in Morocco, Mexico, Colombia, at Harvey Nichols’s, Selfridges’s, etc. We have a lot of opportunities to develop, because people no longer see perfumery the same way. That is actually the reason why several multinationals have purchased niche brands. Premium Beauty News - What about France? Celso Fadelli -  France is a difficult market, but that’s normal, it is as if we had decided to sell pasta to Italians. For most French people, perfume is still Christian Dior or Chanel, and it will remain this way for long, but things are changing. We can now feel a different craze, a real legitimacy for resellers to offer alternative perfumes. It is the same with the press, department stores, and independent perfume stores in French regions, which gradually increase their niche perfumery offerings when they notice an added value. For some of them, this segment can account for 60% of their turnover. The distribution network evolves according to the market demand. The fact that a department store like Printemps dedicated such an important part of their new space to alternative perfumery is an important signal. Premium Beauty News - What is the key to Avery Perfume Gallery’s success? Celso Fadelli -  In each point of sale, we mix very different brands, because that is how we can gather as many consumers as possible. These really varied worlds intertwine harmoniously in the same space, and that is the key to Avery’s success: we know how to target different publics with young brands, more classic brands, or brands that will reach different sensitivities. We also help people discover a style, an emotion, and corresponding brands. The emotional dimension is the best hope for survival for our stores. Distribution is going to change for concepts that nourish the experience more deeply."
Chalhoub Group launches its own oriental fragrance line,"According to the Chaloub Group, Saudi consumers spend an average of US$ 700 per month in oriental fragrances. Such massive purchases, combined with a growing interest from tourists visiting the UAE, form an important market with huge prospects for the future. However, existing local brands and stores often lack of quality and fail to meet contemporary expectations, said the group. “Many brands either have a very limited assortment or in sometimes not very qualitative formulations. It is rare to find a brand offer in the market that fulfills all of the consumers fragrance layering needs. In this category, younger consumers need to experience something more contemporary. They want to experience a new offering that fits their modern lifestyles however while remaining grounded in their heritage and culture,” Patricia Khoury, Head of Marketing at Ghawali, Chalhoub Group. In the Persian and Arabic cultures, layering is a key element of the art of perfume. It consists in the application of multiple layers of oils, or attars (such as musk, oud, rose or jasmine) that will be used to infuse clothing and hair. “In the Arabic culture, fragrance is more than just a scent; it is linked to traditions, values, status and heritage, hence strong emotional bonds with the brand are essential,” said Patrick Chalhoub, co-CEO of the Chalhoub Group. Featuring a total of 90 products, the Ghawali collection of scented products has been designed to facilitate the layering ritual. The range spans from perfumes, oils, Bokhour, and precious Oud to bath and body products such as shower gel, hair and body oil and body cream to complete the ritual. Through this new venture, which combines a line of oriental fragrances and the corresponding stores, the Chalhoub Group aims to develop a differentiated offering which recaptures the ritual aspect, through a modernised, structured and luxurious retail concept while remaining rooted in heritage and culture. “We created Ghawali with the aim of being closer to our customers, to create memorable shopping journeys and offer a unique and personalised service within luxurious surroundings. Ghawali means something precious, something dear and this is how we feel about our Guests,” adds Patrick Chalhoub. The first Ghawali store (with a surface of about 170 sqm) opened its doors in Dubai Festival City on 26th of August followed by a second store of 132 sqm in City Walk in September. Three Ghawali stores also opened in Saudi Arabia, in Riyadh on the 31st of August (170 sqm) and in Jeddah at the Noujoud Centre (165 sqm) and at Sea Mall (186 sqm) on the 2nd the 9th of September, respectively. This is only the beginning as the Chalhoub Group plans on expanding Ghawali to the entire region within the next five years."
iTiT Cosmetics celebrates its fifth anniversary,"Premium Beauty News - This year can be considered a milestone for iTiT Cosmetics! Mirko Panico - It is indeed a special year. Five years ago iTiT Cosmetics was founded with the aim to create a new company specialized in the design, study and manufacturing of high profile cosmetics. iTiT Cosmetics is the result of an idea and an entrepreneurial partnership between me and Raquel Melgarejo Antequera. We had a vision: “Global Cosmetics Designer”. A unique and innovative concept in the field of cosmetics, which proposes ideas, concepts and unique products. From the creation of lip products and emulsions, the field in which we operate, we developed as a global cosmetic designer shortly after its inception proposing innovative products, which included those for the eyes.

Berdoues bets on the growth of niche perfumery in Brazil,"Launched in 2015, it took only a few months for this premium line to conquer more than 25 markets, in Europe, the USA, the Middle East, and even in Asia. “Founded in 1902 by Guillaume Berdoues, the company presents a real beautiful story of perfume creation and manufacturing, and we entirely make our fragrances ourselves. So, given our strong culture, Sophie Berdoues, the group’s current President, decided to support the niche perfumery wave and develop a luxury line of beautiful perfumes,” explains Alain Bastoul, the group’s Export Director.  Similarly to exceptional wines, delicate materials and care are what made the collection immediately popular. It is in this context that the group entered the market with eight references, in partnership with Cristiane Vilar, the only distributor dedicated to niche perfumery in Brazil, and the founder of the Cosmopolitan do Brasil store in Brasilia. Available in Brazil for the equivalent price of EUR 120, which includes the extra cost associated with the entry taxes, the Grands Crus perfumes are sold in four points of sale at this stage, including Cosmopolitan do Brasil. “We are hoping to open about twenty doors in the long run, by choosing exactly which retailers love beautiful perfumery,” asserts Alain Bastoul. In this country, where perfume is king, the most famous brands also remain the most popular among Brazilian consumers, who are keen on well-known classics. Nevertheless, under the influence of initiatives like Cosmopolitan do Brasil and of the American model, Brazil is gradually opening to alternative perfumes.  “It has a great potential, as Brazilians travel a lot and can see what is going on elsewhere. The demand is going to rise,” Alain Bastoul declares, before concluding that “alternative perfumery is likely to make up 10% of market shares for the three years to come.”"
The COSON phenomenon,"A total staff of 320, three factories, including one in China, USD 650 million in sales, the COSON Company, (short for ""COSmetic champiON"") is undeniably the up-and-coming company in the sphere of world sub-contractors serving the make-up industry. A rather original story, that of the company, which started in 2000 with the creation of one and then several skincare brands. Products developed are good, not to say excellent, and in no time the company enjoys a meteoric rise propelling it among the leading companies in South Korea. In 2014, the Head of the company decides to complement its activity by becoming a subcontractor and to extend its scope of action from skincare to make-up. The right move obviously, since this year the firm can boast a total turnover of USD 650 million, including USD 150 million from make-up, on par with the turnover achieved by skincare. And demand is so high, the three existing production units, in Korea and China, are no longer sufficient. A new factory covering an area of 9,000 sqm will be built from the ground up, in Korea next year, next to the 6,400 sqm current site. Fifty-five people work full time at the R & D department and no one can deny that at each trade show to which the firm takes part, in particular the ""MakeUp In"" events, the COSON stand is busy all day long. Best of all, the company has also positioned itself as an ""incubator"" of new brands by creating a division called ""OBM"" that currently manages 30 brands. A dynamic and visionary man, Mr. Lee...! Quite enough in any case, to seriously challenge major current market subcontractors, especially since the reputation in terms of innovation of COSON is not over done. As a proof, the recent and amazing formulas developed by the Korean company showing sceptics that it is still possible to innovate in this sector. To note finally, that the company has decided to partner with the Hunan Yujiahui Cosmetics Company, a leader in the Chinese sheet masks market, to secure the ever-growing market for its cosmetics. Hunan Yujiahui Cosmetics will start with COSON’s sheet masks and in the future will develop products through original development manufacturing (ODM), the company explained. COSON already has a strategic partnership with Yujiahui to supply ODM products to its four brands, including Yunifang, which has topped the Chinese sheet mask market."
Schwan-Stabilo Cosmetics is celebrating the first year of existence of its us plant in Murfreesboro ,"Premium Beauty News - Can you take stock of this first year in Murfreesboro and maybe tell us more about your plans for the future? Thomas Krasser - It’s been a great journey and we are very happy with the results so far. Production is in full swing, and we are just in the process of extending the local product portfolio with custom-made, innovative formulas and new products. In addition to product development and manufacturing, the focus is also on turnkey solutions and supply chain services that are geared towards the individual needs of our customers and are thus meeting the dynamics of the market. Premium Beauty News - The American market has always been important for Schwan Cosmetics. But this year is special for your company, isn’t it? And you are returning to MakeUp in New York ! Thomas Krasser - Yes, definitely. It is exactly one year since we took the very important step of opening our Competence Centre in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. With our state-of-the-art plant and the label Made in the USA we offer our American customers exclusive added value and have taken the importance and the needs of the US consumer market even more into account. In Murfreesboro we develop and manufacture a large variety of cosmetic products exclusively offered on the US market – this clearly reflects how focused we are on American consumers and their specific needs. With this year’s MakeUp in New York, we’ve now come full circle, and are happy to again be part of this important beauty industry platform. This is also the perfect occasion for thanking our customers who have accompanied us on last year’s journey. Premium Beauty News - Which product novelties and innovations will you present this year? Thomas Krasser - This year’s Zeitgeist & Colour Trend presentation is all about change. The three trend topics – Emancipating, Transforming, Awakening - represent different types of women, symbolic for an ever-changing world. In keeping with this vision, we will show a wide selection of innovative products for different skin types and applications. Especially for the American market, our R&D Team in Murfreesboro developed a new, highly nurturing lip butter generation, which will be shown in a Limited Edition Collection. Another focal point is the launch of unique applications for Liquid Liners. Visitors can look forward to an extended range of our popular pen-type products plus a new Liquid Liner Tool that allows several line widths (such as cat eyes) and – thanks to its 24h durability - is also suitable for body tattooing."
Fiabila: More than EUR 65 million invested in five years!,"With the regularity of a metronome, Fiabila is unfolding its impressive modernization and development strategy. The motto of the Miasnik family, ""Be the best and stay the best"" could not be truer year after year. In five years and a half, the French firm spent more than 66.5 million euros to stay at the top. ""There is no other choice,"" insists Pierre Miasnik. ""Regulatory requirements and our customers’ needs don’t allow us any respite. Since our inception in 1977, the quality and performance of our formulas have always been our primary commitments. Our French plant in Eure et Loir is a proof of this and, as was done on a smaller scale in Brazil, we are duplicating the process in the U.S., with in addition the aim to invest in conditioning activities and to open an office in Los Angeles. The total investment in the U.S. will thus amount to USD 20 million."" It may be recalled that the new facilities of the French plant are home to 16 tanks for the storage of raw materials, 4 kilometres of pipelines to convey them separately with no risk of cross-contamination, not to mention the fact that the computerization and security of processes were stepped up at each production stages. Good environmental practices and working conditions are also key components of this industrial combination. Hence the trapping and reprocessing of volatile compounds and the recycling of washing solvents enables to reduce our carbon footprint. The delivery of bulk raw material with dedicated tanker lorries, allows saving several thousand metal barrels per year. Finally, as a consequence, the increased automation contributes both to enhance the safety of the employees and improve the working conditions. ""With this industrial tool and these new processes, insists Pierre Miasnik, we really pushed the limits to a level never reached before!"" A 2016 year that looks very promising for the Group with a turnover expected to post a double digit growth rate. ""And this, explains Pierre Miasnik, in spite of relative market stagnation in the U.S. and Europe, although South America is progressing. We are constantly winning over new market shares, which tends to show the level of confidence market players, large or small, have in us. A loyalty that did not happen by chance. We have the product lines the market is looking for. Our customers know that they will find with us quality not to say consistent quality"". Whether in Europe, Brazil, the U.S., Japan, Mexico, India, China... the Group will keep up the pace in its industrial investments strategy. ""We also invest a lot in research and creativity,"" underlines Pierre Miasnik. ""It is essential because market players are more and more in demand for new products!"" To note that the company was granted its final operating license for Brazil, namely the Anvisa, meaning that its production site can now start running, both from an operational and regulatory point of view."
The digital revolution is central in L’Oréal’s recent US acquisitions,"The acquisition of IT Cosmetics is the biggest for L’Oréal, since the acquisition of Yves Saint Laurent Beauté in 2008 for 1.15 billion US dollars.  The total amount paid by the French cosmetics group is almost 7 times higher that IT Cosmetics net sales over the last12 months (US$ 182 million at the end of June), which may seem quite expensive.  However, IT Cosmetics is growing strongly (+ 56% year on year to end June), thanks to an efficient multichannel distribution network combining TV shopping and online sales with a presence in major beauty retails such as Sephora and Ulta. ""Another example of a great beauty player grabbing a small innovative, original and successful brand,"" commented analysts at Société Générale. Last week, for instance, Unilever took over Dollar Shave Club, another US start-up leading US online sales of male shaving products, for a price representing about seven times the company’s annual sales. The digital revolution has ""completely transformed barriers to entry such as marketing and distribution"" and the consequence is that the beauty market is getting increasingly “uberized”, said Thomas Owadenko, CEO of start-up Octoly, which specialises in partnerships between beauty brands and digital. Most of these influencers are passionate consumers of beauty products, mostly young women, such as their followers, mostly digital natives. To attract the youngest generations of consumers, major cosmetics groups began by forging promotional partnerships with social networks celebrities. L’Oreal, for instance, partnered with American YouTuber Michelle Phan or French Enjoy Phoenix. Estée Lauder partnered with Instagramer Kendall Jenner. As far as US beauty niche brands like Tarte, Too Faced, E.L.F. Cosmetics, Anastasia Beverly Hills or IT Cosmetics are concerned, they have focused on less famous but increasingly popular influencers. They were also closer to their target audience. Brands offered them recently new products for free so as they can test and - maybe - make public comments. This inexpensive marketing strategy proved very lucrative. “New American beauty brands are really hacking the market. They divert codes, they show unbridled creativity, can quickly catch the latest trends and have very good knowledge of alternative retail channels and social networks,"" Leila Rochet-Podvin, founder and manager of consulting firm Cosmetics Inspiration and Creation, told AFP. Conversely, stay at the forefront of trends is ""a true challenge to traditional brands"" as beauty influencers ""are eager to find original and unique products,"" added Leila. To meet this challenge, L’Oréal took over successful US makeup brand NYX at the end of 2014 with the aims to learn more from its marketing model and to develop the brand globally. ""We’re like a small start-up within the L’Oréal group,"" said Elise Ducret, head of NYX France, in an interview with AFP. The brand’s expert knowledge of communication on social networks has been a key factor of its success. ""Highlighting the brand’s influencers and consumers,"" has been the main promotion and communication tool.  In France, for instance, a network of about 30 web influencers was carefully selected.  However, NYX does not pay them, states Elise Ducret.  ""Actually, they do not want to contract with a brand, to maintain credibity,"" in the eyes of online communities. However, paid partnerships between brands and influencers are not uncommon. Bloggers, YouTubers and other Instagramers have gained such a huge influence that several of them have been able to professionalize their business. The quality of their articles, photos or videos is often the demonstration that this is now a serious job. Many beauty brands or retailers do rely on their skills to boost their presence in social media and may be ready to pay influencers.  Taking inspiration from the affiliation programs of online retailers such as Sephora or Amazon, US brand Sigma Beauty, for instance, has chosen to pay web influencers directly on the basis of the sales they generate."
Marionnaud invests to enrich digital experience in beauty stores,"All consumer studies unanimously emphasize the vital importance of the web and social networks in today’s purchasing behaviours in the beauty and personal care segments.  Consumers get online to find information, compare products and prices, and the buy in store or - increasingly – online. Marionnaud therefore intends to facilitate the purchase experience of its consumers by adding new digital services in its stores. The European beauty retailer now offers free broadband WiFi access in all its beauty stores and salons.  Customers can now more easily share their shopping experience, their favourite product or their ""Beauty Code"" on social networks (Facebook, Instragram, etc.). Moreover, watching videos or listening to music will be made easier and more confortable during salon treatments. In order to help customers to have an easy and permanent access to the web and social media, Marionnaud has equipped 77 stores and salons, including the Champs-Elysées flagship store, with new connected smartphone charging boxes named “bubbles”. This news service will be extended to all Marionnaud stores by the end of 2016. Eventually, Marionnaud now offers the possibility to pay directly to a shop assistant with a new mobile point of sale credit card reader on iPads.  This service, which is available in a selection of stores, should accelerate the purchasing process by accelerating the checkout step. ""Digital services reinforce the expertise of our beauty consultants and enrich in store shopping experience. We intend to offer each customer a high variety of connected services and we will continue to innovate digitally in the coming months and years,"" said Eileen Yeo, Managing Director of Marionnaud France. In 2014, Marionnaud was a pioneer among selective beauty retail chains with the launch of a free Click & Collect service. In 2015, all the retailer’s stores were equipped with iPads, with several proprietary applications including ""Beauty Code"", a new customized digital service aiming at reinforcing the expertise of beauty consultants and their relationship with customers. Furthermore, since 2015, all Marionnaud stores also offer exclusive and free skin diagnosis in partnership with Ioma, a young brand that pioneered connected and personalized beauty. As far as the A.S. Watson Group, Marionnaud’s parent company, is concerned, significant investments in e-commerce, including the launch of several mobile applications, were announced recently, with the aim to strengthen relations with customers online and to enhance online shopping experience.  In particular, A.S. Watson explained that its e-commerce business increased by 47% in 2015 in Europe."
"""We are considering our international development with ambition but with no rush,"" Rocco Pacchioni, Puressentiel","Premium Beauty News - How would you describe Puressentiel in a few words? Rocco Pacchioni -  Puressentiel is an environmentally responsible brand specialised in aromatherapy products and organic and natural cosmetics, which solely relies on essential oils and pure natural ingredients with proven efficacy. The brand offers some 180 products divided in 25 lines to naturally address the daily health, of the whole family (purifying of ambient air, muscle and joint relief, allergies, respiratory well-being, sleep, slimming...). Efficacy and safety are at the heart of our DNA: 191 scientific studies confirm the efficacy and tolerability of our ranges that can boast a record satisfaction rate of 99.33% from users. Our Supply Chain and Quality Department implemented several charters including the ""Puressentiel Product Quality Charter"" and the ""Puressentiel Raw Materials Quality Charter"" to guarantee quality, eco-friendly raw materials and 100% pure, natural and effective active ingredients. Premium Beauty News - The brand experienced an impressive development in just ten years? Rocco Pacchioni - Puressentiel took advantage of the growing public interest for aromatherapy and natural solutions, while simplifying and broadening its use. Our products are ready for use, and we have carefully prepared our essential oils with well-formulated blends to guarantee optimal efficiency and safe use. At the brand’s inception we were able to build on the diversity of the pharmacy network in France to create new markets. The Puressentiel Purifying Air Spray with 41 essential oils, is the brand’s best-seller and the very first natural air freshener launched on the marketplace. It is now number 1 in the aromatherapy market with an 8.5% market share in France and a 4.3% growth in 2014. Premium Beauty News - How do you consider your international development? Rocco Pacchioni - With a lot of ambition and no rush! We are already present in 68 countries and more than 25% of our turnover is generated from export sales. For the past three years our ambition has been to open a new subsidiary abroad and to set foot each year in ten new countries with the support of distributors. We are mainly present in Western Europe and Africa. We are ramping up our development in Central and Eastern Europe by entering the Polish market and with some launches planned in September in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. But the really big challenges ahead for us are Asia and North America. We launched our brand in Quebec last year and we will enter English Canada in September. Canada of course is a gateway to the United States where we aim to launch Puressentiel at the end of 2017 or early 2018. We were lucky enough to attract the attention of all the major drugstore networks and we are learning to work with them. And for that, we can leverage our experience in UK with Boots and Superdrugs. It’s a big challenge, because the natural market is very fragmented, each country has its own consumption and distribution patterns and its own players. There are few international brands in this sector; we are usually faced with very local competitors. Premium Beauty News - Innovation is at the heart of your success. What are the next steps? Rocco Pacchioni -  We have changed the market landscape by inventing new product categories. We have also revolutionized the market of snap-on pumps with large tanks, with our new patented pump PES600. The result of two years of work, this pump with a 600 micron microdispersion, propellant-free - the winner of the 8th edition of the Aerosol & Dispensing Forum (ADF) Awards - allows optimum diffusion using the micro-dispersion of essential oils with no use of propellant gas. We regularly launch new products in all categories where we operate: OTC, medical devices and cosmetics. We will complement our existing ranges at a steady pace: nearly 200 products are under development!"
Italcosmetici: A promising new start,"Premium Beauty News - A year ago, almost to the day, you were taking over Italcosmetici. Quite a challenge with already some satisfactions.   Giuseppe Campanella - Yes, indeed, we can only be satisfied! The strategy, which consisted during the first year, in participating to other exhibitions abroad, particularly MakeUp in Paris, enabled to estimate the strong points of the company and its notoriety: more than eighty contacts in Paris, out of which, one third from French companies and the rest from foreign companies including Australia. So, we are very confident for the coming months. So much so that we are seriously considering relocating in new industrial premises by the end of next year. Premium Beauty News - A long standing company, a wide range of products and an excellent image! Giuseppe Campanella -  Absolutely! For the past 35 years Italcosmetici has been producing a wide range of face products like foundations ( liquid, semi-fluid or creamy, compact, with SPF protection, cream to powder, moisturizing, matt or shimmer ), stick foundations ( long lasting, covering and pan stick ), concealers (stick, creamy ), powders ( compact, loose, mosaic, powder balls, mineral ), blushes ( compact, loose, stick, creamy ), make up primer and highlighter, mascaras ( classic, volume, long lash, all in one, water proof ), fortifying bases, eyeshadows ( 
compact, creamy, loose, mineral ), eyebrow fixers (compact, creamy), eyeliners (fluid, creamy, gel, compact), Lipsticks ( different textures, from mat to extra pearled ), No transfer pens, Liquid lipsticks, Lip-glosses ( stick, creamy, poured ), Lip balms, Sun sticks. We design and produce highly innovative top quality products with security standards, high regard and respect for the environment. We offer a tailored service for clients to identify and place new products on the market, laying the bases and supporting them in the pursuit of their success. From research to production to the realization and launching of the product we are able to guarantee a full service. We develop high quality formulas increasingly oriented towards respecting the environment, integrating natural products with active ingredients and processes informed by sustainability.  Premium Beauty News - In recent months, you even increase the staff? Giuseppe Campanella -  Three new people have joined us in the R & D department, bringing the workforce to 35 people, including 23 women. Women hold the responsibility of 3 out of 6 departments. The company’s average seniority is 10 years. 6 graduates and 15 high school graduates. In the past 5 years our employees have attended +100 hours of training on technical, commercial, security and quality matters. Our employees have, globally, over 400 man/years of specific experience in the production of cosmetics! The company’s know how is widespread and about half of the employees participating in weekly meetings of planning and activity control. Security and safety is an absolute priority and in 35 years there have been only five incidents, none of them with serious consequences. There have been no cases of illness originated from the working environment. We have a proud history of loyalty within the company. Seven people are in charge of research, development and control activities. The average age is 40 years old, while the company’s average seniority is 12 years. Three are graduates, while two are technical high school graduates. The laboratory is equipped with the most advanced machineries available on today’s market (centrifuges, viscometers, colorimeters, conductivity meters, agitators, penetrometer, turbo-emulsifier.) and allows us to engage in the full formulation cycle, from formula to pilot production. The laboratory carries directly or outsources at least 10 standard analyses on production. When developing new products, all the analyses on the chemical-physical features, microbiological analyses, search for heavy metals and duration tests, are assigned to external laboratories in order to obtain independent certifications. In 35 years of activity, the company’s R&D has produced around 150 texture bases in over 3.000 shades. In recent years we have been more assertive in finding solutions increasingly based on natural raw materials as well as on active ingredients. The lab is able to develop new formulas according to the client’s needs, as well as reproducing solutions already on the market. Every year we manage several projects, based on clients’ requests. Despite the recent dimensional growth and the increase in volumes of activity, the technical expertise andcreativity, we have maintained the ability to develop personalized solutions for each of our clients. Premium Beauty News - A few words about the production tool… Giuseppe Campanella - Production is articulated in three departments: emulsions, powders and filling/packing. The emulsions department makes use, among other things, of 17 fusers with mixer (5-150 kg), 3 fusers with turbine (12-100 kg) and 4 turbo-emulsifiers (8-150 kg). The powders department employs 1 rod mill (over 300kg of productive capacity per day), 13 powder mixers, 2 moist powder mixers, 4 coating pans and 3 ovens with a daily productive capacity of over 200kg per day of powder balls or 80/100 kg per day of powders. The packing department uses several filling machines (6.000 pieces per day), as well as one automatic machine for lipsticks (2.000 lipstick per hour), and 8 semi-automatic compactors. The productive activity undergoes constant quality controls that employ 3 people full time. In 2015, Italcosmetici have managed almost 500 orders from 40 clients located in 24 different countries. Logistic activity has transferred 120 tons of merchandise in over 300 international deliveries. Despite the recent dimensional growth and the increase in volumes of activity, the productive and logistical capacity of Italcosmetici maintains the ability to develop personalized solutions for each one of its clients. We also offer to our clients the possibility to buy the following products in bulk (Lipstick paste, MOQ 10 kg, Mascara, MOQ 50 kg black 30 kg coloured, Eyeliner, MOQ 30 kg, Eyeshadows, MOQ 10 kg, Blush, powders and bronzers, MOQ 25 kg, Powder balls, MOQ 30 kg mono-coloured 100 kg multi-coloured cocktail, Foundation, MOQ 50 kg, Cream concealer, MOQ 30 kg, Lipgloss, MOQ 10, 25 or 30 kg, Liquid lipstick, MOQ 10, 20 or 30 kg. 
The lipstick paste is packaged in blocks weighing 10 kg each. Mascara is packaged in plastic barrels weighing 20 to 25 kg each. Powders are packaged in plastic bags and placed in cardboard boxes weighing 8 to 13 kg. The delivery of the product generally takes place at our plant. Premium Beauty News - You also have a Full service offer?   Giuseppe Campanella - Yes, we can offer our clients a full service of design and supply of single products or complete lines. The full service activity starts with the identification of the technical and marketing features of the product or line. At this stage, the client interacts with the lab and our commercial staff. Once the textures, the colours and all the technical characteristics that are able to support the desired commercial claim shave been defined, the lab starts the R&D process that leads to the choice of the formulas. We then proceed to the development of the prototype and the verification of the client’s proposals. At the end of this stage, we move on to more complex testing activities that also include the contextual redaction of technical-scientific documentation required by European legislation. The primary and secondary packaging is supplied by Italcosmetici. Generally, the minimum quantity required by single order is lower than the minimum purchasing order for packaging. In this case, for full service’s customers, Italcosmetici guarantees a stock service in its warehouse. Depending on the type of order, Italcosmetici can request advance payment for the minimum purchasing order of packaging. The delivery of the product generally takes place at our plant. Despite the recent dimensional growth and the increase in volumes of activity, the productive and logistical capacity of Italcosmetici maintains the ability to develop personalized solutions for each one of its clients. Premium Beauty News - You rely obviously a lot on export sales!   Giuseppe Campanella -  Historically our company has always had a big influence in Italy and throughout the Middle East. But we plan to expand to other countries in the world."
"“The cosmetics industry is facing many challenges,” John Chave, Cosmetics Europe","Premium Beauty News - Market data recently published by Cosmetics Europe are rather positive for the European personal care market, despite important disparities between the European states. John Chave - The disparities broadly reflect those of the economic situation in Europe.  But the good news is that the market returned to a more robust growth in 2015, despite trying economic circumstances.  The European cosmetics and toiletries market grew by +3.1% in 2015, compared to 2.1% in 2014. It is also a demonstration that our industry is constantly adapting to meet the needs of a changing world.  A combination of factors such as globalisation, digitalisation and the need for greater sustainability are reshaping consumer behaviour with regard to cosmetics and personal care products. Premium Beauty News - One of the main topics at the Cosmetics Europe Week was the contribution of the cosmetics industry to the European economy and society. John Chave -  Actually, when you talk to regulators or legislators about cosmetics, the main topic is usually risk, risk and risk. Sometimes, we can also talk about risk assessment! But we never talk about benefits, which is very different from other industries!  Thus, it was very important to stress the benefits of cosmetics in daily lives. Briefly speaking, the cosmetics industry is a big contributor to the competitiveness of the European economy, and to research and innovation in Europe. According to the report prepared by Risk & Policy Analysts Ltd. (RPA) on behalf of Cosmetics Europe, at least 2 million jobs are supported across the European value chain of the cosmetics industry.  In 2015, the European cosmetics market was valued at 77 billion euros, making Europe the largest market for cosmetic products in the world.  Over 17 billion euros of cosmetic products were exported from the European Union in 2015. Furthermore, the European cosmetics industry is still a very much SME-based industry.  There were 4,605 SMEs in the cosmetics industry in Europe in 2015, and the number is growing. Cosmetic products are also an important part of people’s everyday life and bring important functional and emotional benefits. Premium Beauty News - What are the key challenges the cosmetics industry is currently facing? John Chave - There are many!  First of all, I would mention the move to a more risk-based approach for the assessment of ingredients and products, rather than a hazard-based approach. Another key challenge is product preservation.  There are very few new preservatives allowed in the market.  We need to defend existing ones and to adopt a more holistic approach of product preservation. Eventually, I also have to mention the ban on animal testing, which is once again before the EU Court of Justice.  The outcome might be a more restrictive interpretation of the ban, which would prohibit cosmetics makers to any substance tested on animal for the purpose of other legislations.  This would not be consistent with the interpretation of the EU Commission. Premium Beauty News - What about the British vote to leave the EU? What could be the impact on the cosmetics industry? John Chave - Despite Brexit, the UK will remain a very large cosmetics market in Europe. There is also likely to be strong regulatory alignment between the UK and the EU, either because the UK stays in the European Economic Area (in which case the Cosmetics regulation will apply in the UK) or because there will be strong pressure from UK companies to ensure regulatory alignment. Nonetheless, as for all industries, Brexit is a source of damaging instability and uncertainty."
"“L’Oréal knows how to welcome a brand with a strong DNA”, Christophe Cervasel, Atelier Cologne","Premium Beauty News - What are the terms of the purchase? Christophe Cervasel - The whole company was purchased, but Sylvie Ganter and I are still entrepreneurs fully involved in the brand’s future management and development. Premium Beauty News - Will this result in a few changes in terms of development? Christophe Cervasel - We have not planned any specific changes. At L’Oréal, they like what we do, and our objective is to do it even better with them. So, we are going to go on with our development strategy around wholly-owned stores, shop-in-shops, and Sephora. We already went very fast with this distribution strategy, which also includes e-commerce, since the brand has known a 100% growth per year since its creation. The idea is to continue along the same exponential lines, thanks to the group’s strength, which will help us go faster, and to make the brand grow in the points of sale where we are present today, with new customers. Premium Beauty News - What about the global level? Christophe Cervasel -  Atelier Cologne is already present in 40 countries, but we have the ambition to open several stores in the world’s largest cities. We have planned to launch Atelier Cologne in Brazil by the end of the year, which we will be able to do even better now, and perhaps we will open a wholly-owned store shortly after we have entered this market. As for Travel Retail, after Paris, London, and Frankfurt, we have other ongoing projects for personalized duty free areas. Premium Beauty News - How were you convinced to join the L’Oréal Group? Christophe Cervasel -  L’Oréal managed to seduce us thanks to its capacity to integrate a brand with a highly strong DNA and make it become a global brand, while allowing it to keep its identity, as was done with Kiehl’s. They did something extraordinary when they used the group’s strength to serve the brand’s spirit. What we want is to reproduce this success in perfumery. With the support of a group, there is more strength, more means, more negotiation margin, and in certain trades, more expertise, in particular in retail. L’Oréal are fond of our identity, and we would love to go very far with them!"
Brazilian retailer The Beauty Box plans further expansion in 2016,"Premium Beauty News - How many stores does The Beauty Box currently have in Brazil? Breno Salek - We have 37 stores in five Brazilian states: São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Paraná, Distrito Federal and Minas Gerais. Premium Beauty News - What is more lucrative for the company in terms of sales - physical stores or online retail? Breno Salek - Brands these days have to connect to customers through every available channel, be it physical or digital. Both are profitable and e-commerce shows a lot of potential; it has been continuously gaining traction in our business. Premium Beauty News - What are the top-selling brands in your network? Breno Salek - The international blockbusters are Carolina Herrera, Dior, Paco Rabanne and Lancôme. Semi-exclusive labels like French brand Nuxe, Lee Stafford from the UK and US-based The Balm are also very popular, as well as our own brand, which is increasingly gathering new fans. Premium Beauty News - What is your brand’s strategy right now, considering that in the last few years there has been a high penetration of international brands in the Brazilian market and taking into account the shift of domestic brands towards lower-income consumers? Breno Salek - We have a high-low portfolio strategy to supply customers from A to Z. To ensure our marketing mix matches with this wide audience, we gather intelligence on the customers visiting the shopping malls where we operate and on the purchase power in each region. In my experience, people have so much access to information these days that certain brands and products are sought after despite their social class. What changes is the payment method [1] and the impact on the consumer’s budget. Premium Beauty News - What is The Beauty Box’s demographics? Breno Salek - We have a very wide audience, with women in different age groups, as well as a sizeable male audience that seeks out to our men’s grooming and male fragrances sections. Talking specifically about our target audience, we’re aiming for 18- to 35-year old females who love to look pretty, care about their bodies and minds, have their own style and are always up to date with the latest trends. Premium Beauty News - Which category is more popular - fragrances, hair care or makeup? Breno Salek - Perfumes are undoubtedly the workhorse of the business. Makeup is growing nonetheless, in part due to the constant innovation brands bring to the table and the fact that it’s a segment closely connected to the fashion world. Premium Beauty News - What sales strategies have been giving out the best results for The Beauty Box? Breno Salek - We’re always offering new experiences to the point of sale, bringing the brand’s universe closer to consumers by offering trials, exclusive gifts and attractive deals. We also invest heavily in visual merchandising, with information that puts the products into context, and offer a beauty curatorship to customers, with recommendations for their daily beauty routine. Premium Beauty News - What’s next for The Beauty Box? Breno Salek - We’re opening 15 new points of sale in 2016, opening way for new markets in the Northeast and South of Brazil. We’re also investing heavily on our e-commerce platform, which is vital to our omnichannel approach."
Comptoir Sud Pacifique opens a first store in Paris,"Built around the idea of travelling and quality ingredients, the French brand has enjoyed a new boom since it was purchased. The opening of its wholly-owned store mirrors its growth strategy and will to demonstrate the diversity of its new range. “Since 2011, we have taken the time to work on our products, enrich our line, and consolidate our distribution network”, explains Valérie Pianelli-Guichard. And since then, the company has doubled its turnover and developed its export presence. Already available at Beauty Success, Passion Beauté, and from independent perfume stores in France, Comptoir Sud Pacifique will now be able to express the breadth of its concept. Located Rue Saint Roch, near Place Vendôme and Rue St Honoré, a quarter dear to alternative perfumery, the turquoise and white-coloured 25m2 area showcases all references, including those reserved to export. “We have been historically related to this quarter, since the brand used to have a store near the Opera, Rue de la Paix. It is a nice environment for niche perfumes,” comments the Director. Right in the heart of the area, an olfaction table stages the six main olfactory families (floral, oriental, citrus, woody, marine, sweet) using raw materials presented under lids. There are two approaches available for each family to guide visitors in their discovery experience. “I wanted something simple and educational to let people choose their own olfactory environment and find the perfume that best suits them more easily among the 35 we showcase”, adds Valérie Pianelli-Guichard. Just like in a concept store, ranges of ethnic-chic-inspired accessories, bags, scarves, and jewels mingle with perfumes and cosmetics. The atmosphere conveys the brand’s lifestyle with summer colours and travelling and escapism inspirations. Strongly attached to her own independence, Valérie Pianelli-Guichard intends to make the brand develop at its own pace: “From an intellectual standpoint, that is what I am interested in, and I have not achieved everything I wish to yet,” she adds.  Among her priorities, she aims to open other wholly-owned stores, mainly in the countries where the brand is already well-established, like Italy."
Oxygen Development and Carefull Colours: the winning combination,"Oxygen Development is a leading private label manufacturer and service provider for color cosmetics, skin and hair care products. Starting over 15 years ago, it is still headquartered in West Palm Beach, Florida, USA. Carefull Colours Produktions GmbH based in Burgwedel, is also in its field one of Germany’s leading private label manufacturer for color cosmetics.  It was founded some 40 years ago by Cosmolab, USA It produces powders as well as liquid formulas and wax based formulas. Amongst the specialties in color cosmetics is the manufacture of automatic pencils.  ""The primary focus of this merger..."", explains Stefano Castelletti, CEO of Carefull Colours, ""...is of course for both companies to expand their offering to global and European brands thanks to a local production in Germany and the US for nearly all existing product families. German made technology and development, specialty products as well as certified production, are a plus for Oxygen Development. At the same time we improve our ability to capture European market trends.” Nine months after the merger, the pace of investment has gained momentum on both sides of the Atlantic with the aim to ramp up the production capacity. “We have been facing increasing demand, which speaks for the quality of our products, services and innovation. The group will continue on this path,” insists Stefano Castelletti. “On Make up in Paris last week, we launched some new high tech products in the color cosmetics area...” To note among the products presented, the collection TEXTUREYES, featuring high-tech, high-touch eyeshadows with superior performance and striking visual effects. LIPAHOLIC builds on the ultimate Lip make up trend and on the ongoing demand for different types, forms and finishes of lip products. While PERFECT & GO emphasizes on selfie-proof and pixel perfect products designed with proprietary skin perfecting technology. All rounded up by a liner reel, showcasing specialty liner products for eyes, lips and brows with different application shapes."
Olfactive Studio calls on crowdfunders to finance their new bottle,"Premium Beauty News - Why choose this type of solution? Céline Verleure - I had already thought about crowdfunding five years ago, when I created the brand, but there was no funding platform dedicated to this kind of operations then. However, we had actually got consumers involved by launching a Facebook group named Blog du parfum qui n’existe pas (encore) – A blog for a perfume that does not exist (yet) – which invited people to interact with the artistic direction by giving their opinions and ideas, or just reacting. This collaborative project helped design and develop the first fragrances. It is interesting to make people participate, because it creates a relationship and, from a financial standpoint, it can help reach new levels. Premium Beauty News - So, today, crowdfunding can actually help you create a new bottle? Céline Verleure - It can! Until now, the Olfactive Studio bottles were standard. This operation will help us finance the mould of our new exclusive bottle. It represents a huge investment and a real financial constraint, since we are in a transitional year and we have been suffering from the slowdown of certain markets like Russia. The sum was fixed at 25,000 dollars, which makes 22,000 euros over an extendable period of one month. In compensation, and depending on the donations, people get perfumes of the line, samples, candles, and other prizes. It is also a way to discover our fragrances. This bottle will be used for our next perfume named Close Up, a wild amber scent to be released in September, and which donators will be able to discover as a preview. Premium Beauty News - You have chosen the Indiegogo site: why an American platform? Céline Verleure - It is the biggest international platform to accept foreign companies, and the objective is flexible. Americans are also more used to this approach and really attracted to niche brands. But the operation is open to everyone and relayed via social networks, Facebook, and bloggers from different countries. Right now, the project has gathered 66 donators and reached 22% of the objective. The progression towards the goal is updated in real time here."
"Pennelli Faro: More than ever ""Made in Italy""!","Premium Beauty News - Finally your development, these past years, is a proof that manufacturing in Europe under the ""Made in Italy"" seal remains a significant asset in the face of Asian competitors? Sara Zanafredi - Yes, we have the headquarters and the entire production process in Italy, located in the historic and traditional brush manufacturing district of the Cremona area, producing some of the finest brushes on the market since 1971. A dedicated team of technicians and our investments in the research and development of new equipment, together with the constant research of new materials and manufacturing processes, keep us definitely ahead in our field. Our range of brushes covers presently the following areas: Cosmetic, Fine Art, Cake Design, Fashion Applications and Industry. We manufacture each brush with craftsmanship: highest quality materials, attention for the details, natural sense of beauty and true passion for what we do.

Sara Zanafredi - We launched the TIP&BLEND™ brush collection, an innovative range of brushes created to apply both liquid and compact foundation as well as make-up bases. It was created after months of development and design research carried out by Pennelli Faro Research and Development team. This make-up brush is therefore the result of in-house innovation and, for its high-performance and cutting-edge qualities in make-up industry, Pennelli Faro decided to have it protected by an international patent. The TIP&BLEND™ line of brushes is made with a special synthetic fibre, dermatologically tested, hypoallergenic and obviously cruelty free, called DERMOCURA®, which has been developed internally by our Research and Development team. The central tip is the heart of the product, it is used to apply makeup precisely and specifically, to various areas of the face, creating those chiaroscuro effects used especially in contouring. The lip brush, the most recently developed one, is particularly suitable for defining very precisely the lips line and then apply lipstick on the lips. We are also having a remarkable success with our SOFT&FULL range of brushes. As the name says, it is made with a particular type of fibre, synthetic and dermatologically tested, which gives the brushes’ head a feeling of softness and at the same time a of fullness very pleasant on the skin."
Alexandre. J: Niche perfumes that are just different,"Amélie Jabban, Project Manager, needed belief and perseverance to launch her family brand. “At first, we got turned down by several French distributors, but we also had a mixed reception from the press,” she recalls. But where did that relative scorn come from? The brand actually highlighted its own difference! As it adopted almost none of the niche perfumery codes, Alexandre. J did not fit in any category and remained on the fringe of the selective and niche perfume segments. The concept developed by Alexandre. J – named after the brand’s creator and founder – is based on the combination of radical decisions and preferences. On the one hand, the brand has a very assertive visual identity expressed by sophisticated packaging with a strong added value: the coloured, decorated bottles are designed by Alexandre J. himself, ornamented with noble materials like mother-of-pearl, glass paste, or pearls, and presented in a hand-designed leather box well-adapted to gifts. On the other hand, it offers olfactory creations with a strong personality, designed with the help of the new generation of perfumers, like the Flair workshop. “It is essential for us to work with young independent perfumers. There is a crucial close relationship that helps create juices at the core of the creation process. They are good listeners and do not try to develop a commercial relationship between us,” Amélie Jabban emphasizes. Formulated with no compromise on the quality and choice of ingredients, the compositions are all eaux de parfum and express the main note first. “Our specificity is to bank on the top note so that consumers understand the perfume at once. The first impression is the right one, the one that remains even if the perfume changes,” she adds. This olfactory path makes the least-informed consumers more daring, and these luxury perfumes are more easily accessible than most in this category: the low-end products of the Collector collection are available for 95 euros for a 100ml bottle. So, the advantage for Alexandre. J seems to be to help niche perfumery reach a broader public. And despite estimations, the brand actually seems to be finding its own place and public. The brand is distributed in 37 countries and 1,000 points of sale, including about ten in France, where the concept is getting more popular. “Things work very well in most points of sale in Paris and across France. Forty-five items were sold at Jovoy’s last month. We are part of a flow, that of democratized niche perfumery, and we target all types of customers with all budgets,” Amélie Jabban comments. The Black Musks bestseller is the same on all markets, but the Project Manager explains she listens to every country’s desires and specificities, and spends time in-store on all continents to understand customers, their expectations, and the words they want to hear. “Customers often do not know what they want, they buy because it is well-known, or they had a favourite fragrance from the beginning, or they want something different. We must help and support them with simple, accessible, catchy words. The negative estimations we had at the beginning actually reflect a lack of knowledge of French consumers,” Amélie Jabban concludes."
"Barbara Bauer Kropf, Schwan-Stabilo Cosmetics: ""We are investing worldwide""","Premium Beauty News - Which “Schwan Cosmetics” product highlights can the visitors expect at this year’s MakeUp in Paris? Barbara Bauer-Kropf - This year, we will take the visitors on a journey to unknown lands that promise a passionate alternative to ambient conformity. Our Night Garden Limited Edition offers strong and dark colors for an intensive, sensual and mysterious makeup. We especially wanted to spotlight the eyebrows, presenting three different types of long lasting and easy-to-apply products for an intense but still natural look: A browstyler; a liquid browliner and a loose brow powder. But of course, we will also introduce new exciting textures for eyes, lips and the face – a full portfolio. Premium Beauty News - Your company has been very successful during the last years. What are your expectations for next year’s business? Barbara Bauer-Kropf - The beauty market enjoyed a buoyant year in 2015 and especially the color cosmetics sector, which grew in almost all markets. Notably, online beauty trends contribute to the big success of Make-up. Based on what we know today; we expect the positive trend to continue through the next years. Premium Beauty News - What are the main challenges you will have to face in the future to maintain your leadership position? Barbara Bauer-Kropf -  It is very simple (laughs). We will continue to strive for operational excellence and for innovation in all areas, both on a product and service level. Our worldwide network of sales and manufacturing enables us to pick up trends at an early stage. For instance, we are the first supplier offering a complete Halal-certified product range, in order to meet the expectations of our growing customer base in the Middle East and Indonesia. On the product side, contours, brows and lips are doing extraordinarily well at the moment and we have a lot of innovation coming up in these categories. Premium Beauty News - What are the plans for growth and development for your company over the next 5 years? Barbara Bauer-Kropf - We will continue to focus on operational excellence to guarantee client satisfaction and thus contribute to our customer growth. Furthermore, based on our production expertise and worldwide footprint, we will increase our capacities in order to comply with the growing demand of our customers. We are investing substantially in production capacities worldwide: Germany, Czech Republic, US, China and Latin America. We are convinced that the success factor for the future is the global integration of our functions and locations. Last but not least, our 150 R&D employees and product managers constantly enrich our product portfolio with new and exciting creations."
SIMP invests in a new production site in France,"Injected cosmetic applicator creator SIMP has managed to completely transform itself: after doubling its turnover in five years, it is now getting ready to keep up its fast growth for the next few years! Since the former subcontracting SME was taken over in 2011 by Alain Blondel and Éric de Bardonnèche, it has become a reference in design and innovation for mascara applicators and elastomer wipers, and is now positioned as one of the main world leaders. Every year, the company provides its customers with new exclusive models or models available in its standard collections. The company is banking on new capacity means to strategically and efficiently keep up with this development. Since last June, its subsidiary in Mexico has had another 1,700 m2 plant with a capacity of 35 million units. Located in Aguascalientes, the plant is dedicated to the production of rubber parts for the cosmetics industry, in particular mascara wipers, to subcontracting on plastic and rubber local markets, and to assembly operations. In France, SIMP has decided to invest in the construction of a new production site just south of Paris, in Tigery, to replace the Draveil plant in 2017: “The site selected is close to the current plant, so that the whole staff can be easily moved there, which is crucial to preserve the expertise accumulated. It is also at the core of an interesting logistics hub for production flows,” the company managers explain. The building operations will be launched in autumn 2016 for the transfer to take place in summer 2017. SIMP plans to increase its production area twofold (6,500 m2 on a 14,000 m2 area), with premises that will meet the most rigorous safety, environmental, and cosmetic standards. The new plant will still comprise two production workshops for plastic and rubber to maintain all flows and integrate state-of-the-art machines. In a fast-moving competitive context, it is aimed to help the manufacturer remain at the cutting edge of innovation and give him new advantages in terms of capacity, agility, and time-to-market. “It is a major step in SIMP’s history that will help it develop even further and comfort its global leader position on the mascara brush market,” emphasizes Alain Blondel, CEO."
Natura invests in new sales channels to rekindle growth,"After over four decades offering its products exclusively through direct selling, Natura took an important step toward its goal of regaining leadership in the Brazilian market with the opening of its first store in Morumbi Shopping, in São Paulo’s southern suburbs. Natura hopes the convenience and experimentation offered by the physical stores will drive sales, and the synergy among the different channels will increase consumer awareness. Shareholders received the news with relief after a season of bleak announcements. Natura closed Q1 with a R$ 69.1 million loss, adding up to a 40% revenue gap that has been growing since 2012. The company has been facing fierce competition from rivals such as O Boticário, which went from a speck in the rearview mirror to a worthy adversary since its brand revamp five years ago. Premium Beauty News - Natura is a benchmark in direct selling in Brazil. What is driving the company to diversify its sales channels? João Paulo Ferreira - Direct selling will still be our main sales channel, while the stores will take a complementary role. We believe in a synergetic effect taking place between them because our customers are always striving for convenience and now will be able to get our products through different means. The brick-and-mortar stores will enable them to try out new products and further discover our brand, which benefits all sales channels. Premium Beauty News - So the idea is for both channels to coexist? How will this decision impact the work of Natura’s sales representatives? João Paulo Ferreira - We see complete synergy between the two channels. Our vision is that by increasing the supply for our customers, everybody wins. Opening up a new channel generates new opportunities as well as an increase in sales potential for our representatives with a boost in brand awareness. Opening stores advances our plans of becoming a multichannel company. We had already taken important steps down this path such as the distribution of the SOU range in drugstore chains. At the same time, we strongly believe direct selling takes a center role in serving our customers, so much so that we invested in new payment options and digital tools for our sales representatives. Premium Beauty News - The idea is to segment the product range into different sales channels? João Paulo Ferreira - We have a very large product offer, with lines that are more suitable for this or that channel. At the stores, for instance, we are focusing in makeup and fragrances, which benefit greatly from customers trying them out on the spot. On the other hand, the SOU daily care line is better suited for drugstore shelves. Premium Beauty News - Natura had a concept store at Rua Oscar Freire in 2015, but the decision now is to open stores in shopping malls. What are the reasons behind this decision? João Paulo Ferreira - The concept store was part of our learning process to put into practice a carefully structured plan to open our own stores. Our retail strategy, at this point, prioritizes retail stores in busy shopping centers. Premium Beauty News - Is the brand looking into a franchise model or is it sticking to direct ownership for now? João Paulo Ferreira -  We are focusing on having our own stores for now, and it is crucial that we follow them up closely to ensure the stores reflect our core values and beliefs. The franchise model is a possibility for expansion in the future. Premium Beauty News - How are Natura’s plans to expand internationally? João Paulo Ferreira - Our international operations are becoming more and more relevant for our business. We will continue to invest in globalizing our brand, and this is the centerpiece of our expansion strategy. Natura is now present in six LatAm countries - Argentina, Peru, Chile, Mexico, Colombia and Bolivia - as well as France. The Aesop brand has 135 stores in 18 countries."

They allowed us to become one of the leading beauty packaging companies and today we can count among our customers the most important brands in both the domestic and international arenas. Premium Beauty News - But you are also a “designer/producer”? Federico Prestini - Thanks to recent acquisitions, Premi has also become competitive in the field of injection moulding and mould construction. Investments throughout the past years have made of us one of the few companies in our sector that can claim to own about 1000 exclusive moulds. All this allows us to offer our customers cutting-edge packaging solutions. We believe that the best results come from controlling and coordinating all phases of the packaging production process. Premium Beauty News - Environmental concerns mean a lot to you? Alessandro Prestini - Following this corporate philosophy of sustainable development, Premi has invested energy and resources in looking for eco-friendly materials so that today the company can proudly say that it was one of the first firms in its sector to produce an entire line of packaging made of completely recyclable PE. Premi’s vision is to go beyond the simple concept of the final use of the product, working hard to achieve sustainable use of resources throughout development. Premium Beauty News - In fact, your service offer can be partial or total? Federico Prestini -  Packaging personalization is our bread and butter. Attention to detail and careful selection of materials are our strong points. We coordinate all the different phases of the development of the packaging.

2) Optimized times
3) Reduced costs Premi is able to offer its customers a complete service.

Alongside traditional techniques such as colouring, hot stamping, screen printing, pad printing, coating, metallization etc; We can provide unique and exclusive decoration options which are the result of continuous investment in research and innovation. Our specialists will help you choose the most suitable material and finish for the pack to achieve the best results. Upon customer request we can even decorate products that do not feature in our catalogue anymore because our aim is to provide the most comprehensive support for our customers.
We can also produce samples in a very short time. One of the many services we offer is the realization of 3D rendering allowing us to show different proposals for the package and its customization and our development centre is unique in terms of speed! The market is constantly changing and it requires quick decision making. Choosing the most suitable packaging and understanding what our customers want requires great imagination which is why Premi provides a 3D rendering service to show possible forms, style choices, colours and even possible decoration. The high-definition images and attention to detail let us offer customers a representation of the product very similar to reality accelerating the time that leads to the final packaging choice."
L’Oréal Brazil deploys digital tools to attract and retain customers,"Digital innovation has become a priority for L’Oréal Brasil to remain at the forefront of the highly competitive beauty and personal care market. All around the world, the cosmetics giant has been investing in new technologies to smooth its internal procedures, reduce costs and relocate time and money to other areas. This strategy also aims to offer a wider and more varied consumer experience to its target market. ""L’Oréal has made considerable investments in new systems and tools such as mobile apps, CRM, social media monitoring and e-commerce. We view these efforts as part of a greater digital acceleration, which is a high priority for the group on a global scale"", says Paula Costa, chief marketing officer at L’Oréal Brazil. An example was the deployment of the first edition of Beautyhack in March in São Paulo, a hackathon where competing startups developed apps that could potentially improve the company’s strategic projects. Beautyhack’s challenges included integrating the Dermaclub rewards program into consumers’ daily lives; informing and engaging beauty salon professionals on L’Oréal Professionnel, Kerástase, Redken, Matrix and Essie brands; developing an assisted shopping interface for Maybelline products on mobile, tablet and desktop devices; and leveraging luxury products of the L’Oréal Group on special occasions. Out of the 120 startups that took part in the competition, four projects were selected and their winners scored a trip to visit Silicon Valley’s iconic headquarters of Google and Facebook. The winning company, NeoMode, received a R$ 100,000 backing to effectively develop its project dubbed Maybeonlline, which integrates online and offline points of sale on a single platform. According to Costa, L’Oréal Brasil is also overhauling its own technology-reliant processes. ""We’re revisiting support systems for sales and promotion teams, data managing within the company and media investments. There are several fronts where technology is being used to assure our teams have real time access to vital information,"" she says. L’Oréal is trailing a similar path in Europe by deploying the augmented reality app Makeup Genius, developed in-house at the French headquarters. The app uses a face-tracking feature to allow consumers to try out different looks by applying virtual layers of make-up using their mobiles’ front-facing cameras and screens. Users can then share their virtual looks before deciding on a purchase. But L’Oréal’s tech revamp doesn’t stop at marketing efforts and management tools. The Brazilian branch is also interested in using technology to strengthen ties with its consumers. ""Our digital push encompasses the entire consumer journey, from first contact to purchase, usage and repurchase,"" stresses Costa. ""L’Oréal Brasil’s audience is very diverse, which is reflected in our wide range of brands aimed at varied consumer profiles. But digital engagement is something that bridges demographic gaps,"" she says. Costa is quick to remind that their well-ventured innovation experiments have not exhausted the challenges that a dynamic consumer profile poses for the company.  ""Our goal is to keep innovation coming by training our marketing professionals in developing impactful ways of engaging the consumer beyond the traditional channels. There’s also a need to translate our performance metrics into simple terms, assuring our ROI is worthwhile, and keeping our internal systems aligned with the dynamic and ever-shifting lives of our customers."""
Aircos: Objectives exceeded!,"Premium Beauty News - 2015 was focused on investments? Thomas Sirot - Indeed, we significantly increased our industrial investments, particularly in packaging and in automatic assembly and finishing lines. As you know, we have our own injection machine park at the Ardon site near Orléans (France), which is home to 35 machines. This makes us a fully integrated company, from the packaging to the end product, including the manufacturing of our formulas and filling operations. In terms of formulation, our main development focus remains powders. Our mastery in the different powder formulation and production technologies is one of our featured activities.  This allows us also to play a leading role in the field of ""complexion"" but also in the one of eyeshadows, loose powders, body powders, etc. Hence, out of the EUR 900,000 invested industrially over the past two years, 70% benefited to our second production site in Romorantin (France), which has a production and packaging capacity exceeding 100 million units per year. We therefore can boast having a perfect mastery of the case/powder ""couple"" and our image as a Full service provider is not over done. Premium Beauty News - In addition to industrial investments, you also worked on expanding your customer portfolio. Thomas Sirot - This portfolio indeed needed to be broadened. A commercial work, which is really starting to bear fruit not only in France but also overseas. From 10% of our turnover achieved on export sales in 2014, we will reach 25-30% by next year, thanks in particular to a strong breakthrough in the U.S., on both the West and East Coasts. Premium Beauty News - Another strong point is your back injection process? Thomas Sirot - It is clearly thanks to this packaging/formulation expertise that that we wanted and were able to develop this new back injection process called IPM, which enables us to boast a mastery of the container/content compatibility. This process makes it possible to avoid “traumatizing” ingredients (in particular pigments and nacres), and therefore achieve amazing softness and brightness. This still accounts for 25% of our business! Which does not keep us from investing in multi-compacting and automated high capacity compacting. Premium Beauty News - What are your other goals? Thomas Sirot - We boast a true expertise in the filling of lipsticks, mascaras and lip glosses; however, we are concentrating on what we do best: Powders, with the ambition of becoming the European leader in this field. So ...., we will tell you more next time."
"“Service is the key point of differentiation in the prestige beauty market,” Chris Good, The Estée Lauder Companies UK & Ireland","Premium Beauty News - What are the key success factors of The Estée Lauder Companies in the UK?  Chris Good - Being aware of the power and importance of beauty advisors is key. In the prestige market the point of differentiation is the service, so it’s essential to offer the best training and support to our staff. They are the face of our brands and the contact with our consumers. What pleases me most about our UK headquarters is the first and second floor where we have what we call internally our Training Academy - giving them the tools and opportunity to train in a first-class establishment is great. We are working as one with our beauty advisors. We also encourage all of our team members to spend time in the “Field” to experience the Point of Sale. We recruit from a diverse pool of talent both within and outside the beauty industry to drive innovation and creativity and ensure we have a complete understanding of our customers. Our workplace culture is structured around strong values that we refer to as “High Touch” which are integrated into every aspect of our business, focused on service, teamwork, innovation and passion. This has resulted in some great stories of career journeys in our business - excellent examples of people who have begun their careers as beauty advisors and are now leading our brands at General Manager level. Premium Beauty News - What industry challenges are you seeing ahead of us?  Chris Good - There is a general shift of the industry - everything is developing so fast that keeping-up is a skilful juggling game. New technologies mean that anybody can now start a brand and have a global presence overnight. This encourages a lot of new ideas and the industry is more innovative than ever. In terms of packaging and design South Korea is very innovative, and also California with cosmetics and skin care. We have research facilities in South Korea, Japan and California for instance. It’s a real global game, and the challenge is to be agile and inventive to stay competitive. Premium Beauty News - In terms of retail, where do you see growth, strength and creativity? Chris Good - The United Kingdom is a very innovative market. I was appointed here to run the business as an “emerging market” not as a mature one. We have created a culture that supports and empowers innovation - what we refer to as ‘Test and Learn.’ We have been trying out different retail concepts. We were present in Box Park last year (a pop-up retail park in East London), also Piccadilly Circus underground station, and the St Pancras train station. We have to take measured risks to grasp opportunities and London is a great territory to do so. The city is a forerunner in retail. Premium Beauty News - Do you see any big future trends?  Chris Good - It’s difficult to consider one trend only. There is a real polarisation of the market with the fragmentation of product categories. We don’t just talk about ‘make-up’ for instance, but we talk about make-up sub categories: brows, lips, etc. It’s more challenging than ever to be global, serving every category of the market. Being innovative, understanding consumers and being in the “Field” are the keys to success. Premium Beauty News - Regarding the “older” consumers (over 40), which represent a huge portion of the market in terms of numbers and buying power, what is your strategy to address their needs?  Chris Good - The UK demographically is becoming an ageing population. We refer to this group as the ageless consumer. They are equally important, if not more so, than the millennial consumer. Our strategy changes across different brands in our portfolio, we have brands that are targeting younger consumers and some than are targeting an older demographic and the ageless consumer is top of mind for us in everything we do. Premium Beauty News - The male grooming sector is growing, what is The Estée Lauder Companies offering to this segment?  Chris Good -  We have a rich portfolio of men’s brands and products including Clinique for Men, the number one prestige brand in the UK market, LAB Series, Aveda Men, Tom Ford for Men and men’s fragrances such as Éditions de Parfums Frédéric Malle. The male market continues to evolve and we’re seeing more segmentation and new categories as men become more comfortable with grooming. Our pop-up concept in St Pancras station mentioned earlier, The Grooming Station, was launched to help us understand how men engage with our brands and what men value when shopping for grooming products. The learnings from this concept and others - including a grooming destination in John Lewis Oxford Street and distinctive experiences such as the pop-up Aveda barbershop - are helping us to understand how to provide an enhanced and tailored offering to our male customers."

Premium Beauty News - A number of investments are planned this year! Rachel Rendel -  Given the current sustained demand, we have decided to strengthen our population of production equipment, filling lines, powder machines and assembly lines. In addition, we switched to two shifts to guarantee our customers with a timely supply in the best conditions."
Birchbox intends to become the online beauty leader,"Premium Beauty News - What is Birchbox’s ambition today, both in France and on the global level? Quentin Reygrobellet -  Beyond our will to increase the number of our subscribers, we aim, as we always did, to sell cosmetics online and be the first e-merchant in France and around the world. Today, in France, we are part of the Top 3 of e-retailers, right behind the United States in terms of subscribers, and ahead of the United Kingdom, Spain, Belgium, and Ireland. It is to this end that the box concept was originally designed, as it allows women consumers to test products before buying them. We have a unique large-scale logistics system that has also become a precious marketing and communication tool for our 250 partner brands. This premium tool supports online sales, it is our physical footprint. Premium Beauty News - Will your physical footprint also materialize in points of sale, like in the United States? Quentin Reygrobellet - We do have a vision of what Birchbox developed in the United States: the inauguration of a test physical store in Soho. The idea is to make our customers live the same experience as online, as they can discover our products, in particular with “The Factory”, which makes it possible for them to create their own boxes in-store, and they can buy products by a selection of brands. We have applied the same principle to our project to open a Birchbox store in Paris within the next 6 to 8 months, but for now, we have been launching small pop-up stores offering a similar experience to “The Factory”. We were very successful at the Bon Marché department store, so we are going to do it again, also in French regions, this time with Galeries Lafayette in Marseille, Toulouse, and Strasbourg. Premium Beauty News - Is this will to be physically present related to your selective distribution agreement with brands? Quentin Reygrobellet - It is true that in France, the brands we work with would like us to have a store to be able to develop online, but that is the main reason why we launched these initiatives. We do think we need to be present both on and offline to sell cosmetics. Premium Beauty News - Is the box market still as dynamic today? Quentin Reygrobellet - The concept remains attractive and the market keeps growing. We wanted our box to be affordable - around EUR13 - to give all women the possibility to test without any risk. In addition, our subscribers benefit from lower prices when they shop online. So, we have actually created a test-to-purchase transformation tool, and the conversion works pretty well: 90% of our partner brands in 2015 prolonged the experience in 2016 for that particular reason. And statistics even show that beyond developing sales on our website, the box concept contributes to increasing brands’ sales at other retailers. In France, e-commerce represents 35% of our turnover, and 50% of our box subscribers shop online. Mathilde Lacombe - Indeed, and we are also very efficient at renewing our box, from all standpoints. Every month, we tell a different story with a new design, a new theme, and new partners, to keep surprising our subscribers. This way, they feel as if they were part of an adventure in the long term. And brands use us as distributors, but also as a marketing agency. Premium Beauty News - So with this ‘test-to-purchase conversion’ system, the role of consumer feedback must be even more essential to you. Quentin Reygrobellet - Thanks to the beauty questionnaire consumers fill in when they subscribe, the feedback questionnaires, 20 to 30% of which are sent back, and visitor tracking, I guess we know our customers and their consumption habits better than anyone. Besides, all this combined to an algorithm helps us personalize and best target the composition of our boxes, but also our customer relationship. Obviously, this advantage has an impact on the conversion into sales, but it also guarantees the satisfaction to live a unique experience. As for the brands that see us as a research firm, their quantitative/qualitative data feedback and the advice we offer them in terms of digital or content strategies are significantly positive. Premium Beauty News - Have you changed the profile of the brands you distribute? Quentin Reygrobellet - We have many niche and foreign brands, and more and more major brands. Our DNA is to make women discover new launches, not only by unknown brands, but also by other more popular ones."
Kid’s cosmetics: Toofruit steps up its development,"Already present in nearly 600 outlets in France (one half in pharmacies and the other in beauty institutes, plus a few Biocoop and Mademoiselle Bio stores) but also in Austria, Belgium and Switzerland, and several Asian countries (China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Taiwan...), the cosmetic brand dedicated to childcare is launching new references. Building on a second successful fund-raising operation in the second half of 2015, the Toofruit brand is accelerating its development with the ambition to become the reference on the children’s market. ""This is increasingly the case with pharmacists and beauticians in France, even if the general public does not know us very well,"" explains Stéphane Lafond, co-founder and CEO of the Laboratoire Allistère, which develops and markets the brand. To strengthen its position, Toofruit has planned several launches in the first half of 2016.  Were already launched: – two shampoos (with apple-almond and pineapple-coconut scents) specially adapted to sensitive skins,
– a hair detangler in a spray format with a cherry-strawberry fragrance, to use on wet or dry hair,
– and two dermatological ultra rich dermatological bars (pineapple-coconut and raspberry-strawberry scented), hygiene products soft to the skin and currently very popular in Asian markets like Thailand. Very soon, the French brand will also launch its first food supplements with an ""Energie"" formula and an ""Immunité"" formula. ""Studies show a lack of iodine in diets. Yet this element is essential for neuronal growth. Our two new food supplements are made with a bladder wrack extract, a brown algae rich in iodine. Formulas are also complemented with products of the hive (respectively propolis and royal jelly) and acerola, for its vitamin C benefits,"" explains Stéphane Lafond. Products were designed to bring health benefits to kids as part of a 30- day course of treatment, but it does not mean they are not fun and yummy to eat too. Both foot supplements will come in the form of jellies shaped like orange and mandarin slices. Like all the other Toofruit products, these supplements are manufactured in France and are certified organic by ECOCERT. ""However,"" stressed Stéphane Lafond, ""we mostly insist on the fact that our formulas are specially suited to children’s skins, which are much drier than those of adults."" The brand is also developing a second deodorant reference, for children aged 9-10 and above. Finally, after having tested in some Club Med spas specific treatment protocols for kids, Toofruit is also launching its Toofruit Academy in partnership with Club Med. This 20 minute animation performed by a beautician explain to children why the skin must be cleansed, and the effects of pollution. The brand will expand these animations beyond the Club Med spas to most beauty institutes where Toofruit is distributed."
"“Whether in Brazil or on other markets, innovation is the key to our success,” Camille Da Rocha, Technature","Premium Beauty News - What is your strategy for the Brazilian market? Camille Da Rocha -  Our strategy in Brazil is the same as for other areas: we endeavour to meet all our customers’ needs and we provide a real full-service offering that includes regulatory procedures. Our strength lies in our masks. Just like on the other markets, we highlight our innovations (biocellulose, powders, hydrogel masks). We are the first to have developed Ecocert-certified organic peel-off masks, and we are the first to have developed peel-off masks that do not require the skin to be hydrated beforehand. We also create many new textures. In Brazil and in France, innovation is our main asset to face low-cost production. We opened commercial offices in Brazil in 2013, which is a real advantage, as it is quite hard to deal with this market from afar. There is a lot of employee turnover there, so we need to visit companies very regularly. Brazil is a huge market, but customer expectations are really diverse: apart from well-known giants, there are plenty of small brands expecting simple services and solutions. Premium Beauty News - How do you cope with import barriers? Camille Da Rocha - We have concluded a partnership with a local importer. They hold an import licence issued by the ANVISA, and they take care of all registration procedures and make the whole importation process easier. In addition, we make sure we group our orders together for financial reasons: it makes deadlines longer, but our customers are always notified of this point. However, we do not aim to manufacture products locally because our policy is to guarantee our customers Made in France quality. Very high-end Brazilian brands are very keen on this point, even if consumers are usually more sensitive to quality and innovation than to the origin of their products. Premium Beauty News - Can you tell us about your latest innovations? Camille Da Rocha - At the last In-cosmetics Brasil show, we showcased a natural hydrogel mask we are the only ones to offer as a Made in France product. Hydrogel masks adapt to the shape of the face perfectly well and provide an instantaneous fresh effect. They are based on sulphate D-galactose and carrageenans (polysaccharides that form the cell wall in various red algae). This association creates a film-forming gel to make it easier for the skin to assimilate the actives. They can take different forms: eye patches, facial masks, etc."
Feelunique speeds up their market conquest in France,"Premium Beauty News - What has been implemented since Feelunique France was officially founded last November? Claire Blandin - Our top priority was to settle in our new offices in the Marais quarter and get the teams working on the website and Parfumeries Rive Droite store managers together, as we have just bought this brand. Feelunique was made available to French consumers two years ago, but since the branch was founded, our teams have been working on localizing the website for France, which involves translating its content and fixing prices in euros in line with the French market (until then, they were given in pounds sterling and translated into euros). In addition, we are now confident with our commercial action plan, which defines our special offers and launching schedule. Our newsletters are drafted in our new offices with a specific editorial content. Also, we have raised our free delivery threshold to EUR 50, instead of EUR 15, so we can deliver tracked parcels to prevent any losses and, above all, guarantee our customers a delivery within 3 to 5 working days. Premium Beauty News - What about your network of points of sale? How important is it within your strategy? Claire Blandin -  We have four perfume stores located in the cities of Boulogne, Neuilly, Levallois, and Avenue Marceau in Paris, and the last two are being completely revamped. We are actually re-designing them to get closer to the selective segment’s traditional codes, highlighting brands through self-service, a makeup corner, and an animation area. The store located 35 Avenue Marceau is meant to become the brand’s flagship, and by May 30, all stores will bear the Feelunique name, unless anything unforeseen crops up with the renovation work. Premium Beauty News - What brands will be available in your points of sale? Claire Blandin - Given the size of the stores, it will not be possible to display the 500 brands available online. However, there will be a rich, varied offering with luxury perfumery classics and a selection of new fragrances from the niche segment. Premium Beauty News -  Are you planning to open other stores? Claire Blandin - Right now, we are not planning on widening our network, even if it does contribute to meeting our need to get the brand settled. Premium Beauty News - Talking about this, how are you going to gain fame? Claire Blandin - We will be launching an ad campaign in May. It will mainly consist of digital actions to get some notoriety and attract new customers. Premium Beauty News - Why would French consumers choose the Feelunique website? Claire Blandin - We are the only website to offer brands from the traditional selective channel and niche brands, but also emerging brands, spa and salon brands, parapharmacy brands, professional hair care brands, and digital brands developed by bloggers and YouTubers. Besides, we offer as many British brands, some of which are sold exclusively on our website, as French and global brands. Our customers are actually gaining convenience if they buy our products, since they have access to a very wide beauty offering, all segments included, in only one location!"
A.S. Watson invests to enhance mobile shopping experience,"The A.S. Watson Group, the largest international health and beauty retailer in Asia and Europe, has announced the appointment of Mtel - a Hong Kong headquartered provider of digital solution - as its Asia mobile solution partner for the next three years.  Mtel has been tasked with delivering nine mobile apps throughout 2016 for A.S. Watson eLab - the retailer’s an in-house digital division - in Asia.  The nine mobile apps will all have m-commerce function and also allow customer to carry mobile loyalty card. A.S. Watson also recently announced an agreement between its flagship beauty retail brand Watsons and Baidu Waimai, China’s fastest-growing online-to-offline (O2O) platform.  Thanks to the agreement, Watsons products can be delivered to door within two hours of order confirmation on Baidu Waimai e-commerce website. With these strategic moves, A.S. Watson intends to accelerate the enhancement of mobile engagement with customers. Since 2014, A.S. Watson invested US60 million dollars in the establishment and development of its technology platform to drive Customer Relationship Management and digital experience for its retail shoppers.  E-commerce is one of the strategy focus for the group, which now has over 105 million loyalty members, seven e-stores in Asia and eight e-stores in Europe (including Superdrug and The Perfume Shop in the UK, Kruidvat in the Netherlands, Marionnaud Paris and ICI Paris XL across Europe). “Our global web traffic has increased by 98% last year to over 568 million, and 40% of the traffic is from mobile. It is of utmost importance that we accelerate to enhance the mobile experience for our shoppers,” explains Malina Ngai, Chief Operating Officer of A.S. Watson Group. The appointment of Mtel as A.S. Watson’s extended mobile arm will help to accelerate the implementation of the group’s digital strategy in Asia. “In Asia, the Watsons brand in particular is the most trusted health and beauty retailer brand, and our core customer groups across the region are increasingly mobile savvy,” adds Malina Ngai. A.S. Watson sees e-commerce and m-commerce as key factors of success in the market. The implementation of the digital strategy is driven by the group’s eLab division, which currently employs 80 people in Hong Kong, in the United Kingdom and in Milan, Italy. While the agreement with Mtel focuses Asia, A.S. Watson is also eager to enhance its online business in Europe where the group’s e-commerce businesses delivered a 47% increase in sales in 2015. Eager to build stronger engagement and relationship with customers digitally, as well as capture business opportunities in the rapidly growing European online shopping space A.S. Watson is currently looking for agencies and studios to work with the group on its content and digital asset creation, editorial, marketing. “In just a year eLab has helped the Group move forward to serve our digital savvy customers, now we are looking to take our digital content to the next level,” says Malina Ngai.  “I am keen to identify partners who can demonstrate passion in consumer experience online and with the energy to make things happen with speed.”"
Study finds personal care products industry major contributor to U.S. economy,"The Personal Care Products Council - the leading trade association representing the personal care industry in the United States - engaged PwC to measure the industry’s economic and social impact on the U.S. economy, using the most recent government data. First of all, the study highlights the significant role the personal care products industry plays to drive and strengthen the U.S. economy.   In 2013, the industry achieved US $169.3 billion in total sales with 90 per cent in domestic sales and 10 per cent from exports to international markets.  Of the $169.3 billion in sales, $54.5 billion was generated by manufacturers, $47.2 billion by distributors, and $67.6 billion by services providers. The personal care industry also contributes to a strong export economy.   In 2014, the U.S. personal care industry produced a $ 5.8 billion trade surplus, exporting $16.9 billion worth of products while imports were $11.1 billion, while the overall U.S. manufacturing sector experienced trade deficits. Furthermore, the global reach of the personal care products industry continues to expand at a faster rate than the manufacturing sector overall, averaging a 9.5 per cent increase in exports annually from 1990 to 2014. In 2013, the industry added nearly $237 billion to the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), and supported 3.6 million domestic jobs (2.1 million direct and 1.5 million indirect).  The personal care products industry has grown significantly over the last 25 years. Between 1990 and 2014, employment in our industry increased 43 per cent, compared to 27 per cent for U.S. nonfarm employment overall. The study also points out that over two-thirds of the total employment in the industry is in small businesses with less than 50 employees and that women, including women with diverse backgrounds, are at the heart of the industry. The share of management positions held by women in the personal care products industry is higher than the U.S. average.  Women and those with diverse backgrounds account for nearly 74 per cent of all industry employment and 61 per cent of management positions. Cosmetics manufacturers invest nearly US $3 billion in research and development annually.  In fact, 1 in 11 workers in our manufacturing sector are employed in a science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) occupation, accounting for a total of 5,840 jobs.  From 2002 to 2011, the industry increased R&D spending at an average rate of 9.7 per cent annually, compared to 6.9 per cent for manufacturing industries overall. “In addition to the many tangible benefits our companies offer to consumers, the cosmetics and personal care products industry is directly responsible for creating American jobs,” said Lezlee Westine, President and CEO of the Personal Care Products Council.  “We are proud to support the economy, contribute to social and environmental programs and meet the needs of American families.”"
Beauty Success acquires a new dimension,"Beauty Success, the fourth selective perfumery network in France after Sephora, Nocibé, and Marionnaud, is set to reach a new phase of development. After an 18 million euro capital increase in December 2015, the company has just announced it has purchased the Esthetic Center network and will launch a new brand later this month: Beauty Sisters. Straight after entering into partnership with the Tanguy Parapharmacie network, this purchase has transformed Beauty Success into a multi-brand, multi-activity group dedicated to beauty, with three trades represented: perfumery, beauty salons, and parapharmacies. And to make this transition clearer, the company has changed its name for Beauty Success Group. Purchasing the Esthetic Center network - which gathers both beauty salons and nail care corners with the Beauty Full Nails brand - meant launching an ambitious growth strategy for the group’s six brands. With a 1.7% growth, Beauty Success Group achieved “one of the best performances on the French market in 2015”. It now aims to count 385 Beauty Success stores in 2020, compared to 320 today, 15 to 30 Tanguy parapharmacies in 2020, compared to 5 in late 2015, 135 new Beauty Sisters shops, 80 Beauty Success salons, compared to 6 today, and 250 Esthetic Center salons and Beauty Full Nails corners, compared to 170 right now. And to help drive this growth, all Beauty Success Group brands will be represented at the Franchise Expo show to be held next March 20-23, 2016, at the Parc des Expositions de la Porte de Versailles, in the south of Paris. Thanks to the purchase of the Esthetic Center network, Beauty Success can now also reinforce their interest in the beauty salon market, which undoubtedly represents a significant growth opportunity for the company, in particular as perfume and cosmetics selective brands are struggling. With 11,000 beauty salons and few large chain stores, the French beauty care market is actually much less concentrated than perfumery. At the same time, women’s expectations in terms of service quality are likely to get stronger. “One of our objectives is to enhance and homogenize our quality standards in this sector, while diversifying our services,” explains Philippe Georges, President of Beauty Success Group. But to this end, we will need to review the positioning of the Beauty Success salons, so that they are actually complementary to the Esthetic Center offering. “Both concepts are already quite different, though,” Philippe Georges adds. “Esthetic center is specialized in services without appointment, and their salons look much less like stores than Beauty Success salons.” Another crucial phase of development for the group was the launching of Beauty Sisters, a brand whose first shop will open at the end of March in Bordeaux, France. “The concept was designed for 25-year-old young women as a blog-store highly connected to social networks and involving many services as well as new products,” Philippe Georges explains. The offering will be focused on the Beauty Success private brand and enhanced by the company’s makeup artist and models. The small stores (the first one to open will spread across 80 m2) will mainly feature makeup, but also skincare products, accessories, and perfumes, while regularly showcasing new launches. Of course, the idea is to meet new consumer expectations, although the group will not be content with simply following the example of the Kiko or Les Bellista concepts: it intends to offer more of a high-end experience. Ultimately, the 2016-2020 development plan also comprises a significant international part. Beauty Success Group seeks to increase the share of its international business up to 10%, compared to 5% today. With the purchase of the Esthetic Center network, Beauty Success Group is now able to settle in Switzerland. In addition, the group will keep developing in Africa, in partnership with CFAO. 21 Beauty Success stores are scheduled to open in West Africa. The very first one, opened in Abidjan in December 2015, has already achieved one of the highest turnovers of the shopping mall managed by CFAO. “We are also going to suggest our other brands to our partner, CFAO. But nothing has been decided yet, we have no limit, and Africa is not our only international prospect,” Philippe Georges affirms. Indeed, Beauty Success Group will take part in the Cosmoprof show in Bologna, Italy, to represent the Beauty Sisters brand and promote its own private brand."
Sephora invests in Brazilian women’s desire for makeup and expands its retail chain,"Premium Beauty News - How many stores does Sephora have in Brazil? And what are the top selling products in this country? Andrea Orcioli - We currently have 22 physical points of sale in Brazil, of which 17 are retail stores and five are pop-up stores. We also serve the whole of Brazil through our e-commerce channel. Some of the most popular products are the Naked eyeshadow palette (Urban Decay), the POREfessional facial primer (Benefit), the Rouge Cream lipstick (Sephora Collection), the Ultra HD Invisible Cover foundation (Make Up For Ever) and the Eau de Beauté Beauty Elixir (Caudalie). Premium Beauty News - What are the plans for Brazil in 2016? Andrea Orcioli -  We opened two stores in São Paulo and three kiosks in Porto Alegre, Curitiba and Campinas at the end of last year. Our aim for 2016 is to continue growing and bringing exclusive brands and products to our customers, as well as being physically present in new places. We began the year by opening a pop up store at Tijuca Shopping Mall, in Rio de Janeiro, and will invest further in this format, which has really taken off. We will continue to expand our store chain and should land in Rio Grande do Sul later this year. Premium Beauty News - What can Sephora already tell about the behaviour of Brazilian consumers? Andrea Orcioli - We find varied consumer profiles in Brazil. For this reason, we train our cast members so they understand how each client wants to be treated. Some customers want to learn how to apply their own makeup and maintain a skin care routine, while others are looking for tips and there are those who visit the store already knowing what they want to find. We offer a complete experience, which includes the ability to try any product before buying it. In overall terms, Brazil is a very rich market for the beauty industry. Brazilian women care a lot about their appearance and are always on top of the latest trends. At the same time, we live in a continental-sized country with great cultural diversity, which broadens individual tastes even further. One interesting point is that the prestige market in Brazil is historically based on fragrances, but since the arrival of Sephora, consumers have been buying a lot more makeup and skin care products. Premium Beauty News - Is the company thinking of developing a concept store in Brazil? Andrea Orcioli - We already have our flagship store at Eldorado Shopping Mall, in São Paulo. As it is a bigger store, it is where we test product launches and carry out large events. Premium Beauty News - What Brazilian brands are currently available in Sephora? Andrea Orcioli - Feito Brasil is available in our stores, with its natural products for bath, skin and body care, as well as the male grooming brand Dr. Jones. Our website also offers products from other companies, including Duda Molinos, Juliana Paes and Marina Smith by 2beauty. Premium Beauty News - How is Sephora’s relationship with male consumers in Brazil?  Andrea Orcioli - Brazil is the world’s largest fragrances market, which is one of Sephora’s strongest categories - and a very attractive one to male consumers. Our portfolio includes exclusive brands such as Guerlain and Acqua di Parma, and also skin care products specially designed for men. Male customers are becoming increasingly more concerned about their looks and they feel more and more at ease with this idea. That is why we offer a dedicated space for men in our stores, where they can browse, choose the products that appeal to them and ask questions to our cast members. Premium Beauty News - Is there an estimate on when Color IQ will arrive in Brazil, considering the enormous variety of skin tones among Brazilian women? Andrea Orcioli -  We still do not have a set date for that, but our in-store specialists are trained to help customers find a colour that is right for their skin tone."
Différentes Latitudes to strengthen their relationships with brands,"Premium Beauty News - You celebrated the 10th anniversary of Différentes Latitudes in 2015. How much progress has been made? David Frossard - Our company is developing well. We have now reached a 3-million-euro turnover, and it is reinforced by that achieved by cognac brand Frapin: we bought their perfumery licence in 2007. We employ about ten workers, and we distribute the fifteen brands or so in our portfolio in approximately 500 points of sale in about twenty countries throughout Europe and the Middle East, but also in the United States and Russia. All in all, we hold a portfolio of about 300 perfume and perfumed candle references. Premium Beauty News - How do you see the future after spending the past ten years serving rare perfumes? David Frossard - We worked a lot with many brands to help them settle on the market. Now, we intend to favour the brands with which we can build a close, long-lasting relationship. The market changed following the boom of niche brands. Today, we need as much passion as before, but much more professionalism. And to meet this new challenge, we have chosen to limit the number of brands in our portfolio, but to work even more in depth with those that are ready to invest in their image. When you are an agent, you know that when the first brands you got in your portfolio develop well, they will end up standing on their own two feet, so you need to regularly try and discover new gems. However, we no longer want to just act as a business incubator, we actually wish to support brands on a long-term basis and get more stability in terms of development. So, we have been strengthening our ties – in particular our capital ties – with brands. And that is what we have been doing with Liquides Imaginaires: now, they have a turnover of one million euros, and we are trying to raise funds for the second time. Premium Beauty News - What about new projects? David Frossard -  Last September, we launched the parfumsdecreateurs.com website, a directory of niche perfumes and alternative perfumery in France, to inform consumers on brands and help them find the nearest points of sale. We have also just created L.A. Bruket in France, a Swedish skincare brand based on natural actives derived from algae, essential oils, and traditional herbs. Besides, in coherence with this will to reinforce our relationships with brands, we are planning to create and launch BAST, a brand that develops very technical skincare products for sportsmen and women. Apart from that, we certainly aim to develop our retail activity. The Liquides perfume bar concept we inaugurated in 2013 is very popular. The shopping experience we managed to design to focus on services and advice works extremely well, and now we intend to give it more visibility. To this aim, we have been looking for the right partner and a well-adapted site. At first, it might well be presented in the form of a shop-in-shop, within a department store."
Roberts Cosmetics + Containers: From packaging to full-service!,"Premium Beauty News - The way the Roberts Company started some 35 years ago is truly amusing!  Kristen O’Connell - At that time, Mrs. Roberts noticed a bullet casing that bore a resemblance to a lipstick container. She and Mr. Roberts began purchasing retired ammunition molds and modifying them to create lipstick cases. This kind of ingenuity has come to represent the innovative concepts that Roberts is known for to this day. Premium Beauty News - Today, the company has remained specialized in the makeup industry? Kristen O’Connell -  Absolutely! Makeup represents 80% of our activity and innovation is always at the heart of everything we do when it comes to packaging development at Roberts Cosmetics + Containers, I would even be tempted to say ""more than ever"". But we are also increasingly known and recognized for our Full service turnkey offer in the field of makeup. Turnkey services currently represent about 50% of our business. We are proud to say that ""Our creative team knows what’s next!"" And that customers just need to contact our teams to enable us to help them with our innovative formulas and packaging concepts. Premium Beauty News - Innovations which are both ""home-made"" but that you also manage to find everywhere in the world. Kristen O’Connell - We actually go where this innovation exists. For example, we opened an office in Seoul more than fifteen years ago and another one in Shanghai five years ago. Everyone knows that Korea is one of the ""spearhead"" countries in terms of makeup and skincare innovation and developments. Much of our Full service offer is based on this thanks to the help of several partners. Premium Beauty News - Your commercial influence extends beyond the West Coast? Kristen O’Connell - The West Coast still accounts for two thirds of our business but our penetration in the rest of the United States and, in particular, on the East coast continues to increase. This is also one of the reasons for our presence at MakeUp in New York each year. And we were very honored last September to have our Powder Lifter and Eye Lifter selected as innovation winners for packaging and featured on the Innovation Tree. We want to thank all those who took the time to stop by our booth and view our latest innovations! Premium Beauty News - Precisely, in terms of innovative products, what are your latest new products and what can you tell us about them? Kristen O’Connell - We recently launched a roller ball doe foot applicator that allows for a very unique application experience for the consumer. Typically doe foot applicators are limited to lip product, but our new applicator is also perfect for serums and eye area care. We also have some very innovative compact concepts that focus on the elimination of a traditional hinge."
Klorane revives its famous camomile shampoo for its 50th anniversary,"Just like in its early stages, the promise of the camomile shampoo is to brighten blonde to chestnut hair with the reference among natural brightening actives: camomile. Klorane laboratories have selected a particular variety of camomile, Matricaria retutita, due to its high concentration in apigenin, a yellow pigment paradoxically contained in the flower’s petals that settles in the scales without penetrating the hair, and provides it with the golden and honey glints of blonde hair. Just like all Klorane shampoo formulas, the new one is free from parabens, silicones, and phenoxyethanol, and is enriched in camomile extracts. It now also guarantees high enough paediatric tolerance for it to be used on children aged 3, and a new fragrance enhances the honey and wildflower olfactory evocation. In addition to the shampoo, balm, and rinsing vinegar of the range, which were all reformulated, there is a new camomile and honey brightening sun cream: Soin Soleil Éclaircissant. It contains no discolouring agent and can be used by the whole family for sun-kissed hair easy to untangle all year round. Klorane’s new Camomile family will be available in pharmacies in April, and so will the Pomegranate range for coloured hair, also reformulated."
"At forty, The Body Shop wants to reaffirm its position as the world’s most ethical company","The beauty brand has unveiled ""Enrich Not Exploit,"" a plan to protect and nurture society and the environment across all areas of its business, from ingredients and packaging to employees and campaigns. The cosmetics giant has set itself a total of 14 measurable targets for 2020, divided into three categories — enriching people, products and the planet.  Every part of the company’s business are concerned: ingredients, products, packaging, stores, employees, suppliers and campaigns. They include plans to help 40,000 economically vulnerable people access work around the world and to ensure that 100 per cent of the group’s natural ingredients are traceable and sustainably sourced, protecting 10,000 hectares of forest and other habitat. The group has also pledged to power its stores with renewable or carbon balanced energy, to reduce the environmental footprint of its products year-on-year and to invest 250,000 hours into enriching the biodiversity of local communities. The Body Shop also wants 70% of its total product packaging to be free from fossil fuels. ""For us, being truly sustainable means shaping our business to work in line with the planet’s natural systems so they can replenish and restore themselves,"" says Jeremy Schwartz, Chairman and CEO of The Body Shop. ""We have set ourselves a significant goal to be the world’s most ethical and truly sustainable global business."" Founded in 1976 in the UK by Anita Roddick, The Body Shop inspires a loyal following for its ethically and sustainably produced, naturally-inspired skincare, hair care and make-up. It is famous for its iconic products such as its Tea Tree Oil and Vitamin E skincare formulas and rich body butters formulated from shea, hemp, cocoa and mango, among others.  ""The Body Shop courageously pioneered new ways of thinking, acting and speaking out as a company. We were the first in beauty to use community trade and we still have the strongest programme in the industry,” explains Jeremy Schwartz. However, during the 1990s and 2000s many cosmetic brands have followed suit and most major groups have engaged in important corporate social and environmental responsibility strategies. The Body Shop was acquired by L’Oréal in 2006 and counts 3,000 stores in more than 60 countries."
A new milestone for the CEW in France,"Premium Beauty News - Quite a long and compelling story that of the CEW! Françoise Montenay -  You are right! compelling is the word... I would be tempted to also add “exemplary”! The French CEW was created in 1986 on the initiative of Michèle Meyer and quickly focused on active solidarity with the creation in 1992 of the first free Beauty Centre at the hospital Gustave Roussy, South of Paris. Today, 31 beauticians hired, trained and paid by the CEW in the form of fees, provide beauty treatments to male and female patients, in 29 hospitals in Paris and France, and for 21 different pathologies. Through this action the CEW offers patients a relaxing moment, emphatic listening, gestures to sooth, beautify and fight against the harm caused by illness or treatments. In 2015, more than 30,000 cosmetic treatments were offered. As you know we are an non-profit association, affiliated to the CEW Inc., a strong U.S. professional organization founded in 1954 with over 8,000 members and to the CEW U.K. founded in 1992 and with close to 1,000 members. In France, our 500 members hold entry level, mid-level and senior management positions in the Beauty industry upstream or downstream of the chain, i.e., the perfume and cosmetic industry, and aesthetics and hairdressing activities. Our members hold positions in marketing, finance, or as communication consultants, in the industry or distribution sectors. Premium Beauty News - 2016 will be a year of new impetus and your profile and nomination are, in a way, its first expression. Laurence Moulin - Absolutely! This position of Managing Director for France that I have been holding in recent months was created at the request of the Board of Directors and voted by the General Assembly to meet the new challenges facing this network, namely, to strengthen its business dimension and its support to Beauty professionals at every stage of their careers. 2016, represents an important step forward in our development with the opening of the French organisation to men since January 1st (an opening already successful achieved in the U.S. and U.K.) and a strengthening of international exchanges. The CEW as a whole brings together 8,000 Beauty professionals around three associations: CEW U.S.A., CEW U.K. and CEW France.  With the beauty industry being global and its actors, international players, we want accelerate rapprochements and synergies between the three CEWs, because giving our members access to a global network is essential today. As our President, Françoise Montenay stated, the CEW is now also open to men with the aim to promote an overall vision of the profession and of those who embody it. To support this development you will soon discover our new website, clearer, more dynamic, more complete, more user friendly. Professionally, I come from the world of Communication. I was Communications Director at the International Event Agency specialised in public relations and in the organization of events. I also served as Communication Director for Interdeco (now Lagardère Publicité) and then of the Figaro Group. Premium Beauty News - This international network you represent is undoubtedly a strong asset! Françoise Montenay - You understood that our aim was to build a stronger, more united and always more active CEW, with a foothold in all trades in the Beauty industry. This programme of course takes into consideration the rapprochement with the two other CEWs in the U.S. and U.K. In fact, we are only going to place more emphasis on what already existed. For example, we launched in June 2012 the first “Achievers Awards” Ceremony to honour women who are successful in our trade or who have helped members move forward in the profession (taking example on the Achievers Awards in the U.S. or U.K) . With the aim to make it a strong media event occurring every year. It is very important for the CEW to reflect this entrepreneurial atmosphere and culture that characterizes the beauty sector and to put it in the spotlight. Premium Beauty News - You will need to recruit! Laurence Moulin - A proactive recruitment policy will be launched to further strengthen the representativeness of our network and offer always more to our members. The aim is to contribute to their professional fulfilment by boosting their careers and promoting the enrichment of their network. We offer them opportunities for meetings and discussions with high profile professionals on business and strategic topics with a comprehensive platform of inspiring and rewarding events, but also partnerships with leading and innovative Beauty events like MakeUp in Paris. It is also important to recall that the CEW is a unique network that boasts a dual business and solidarity vocation. A positioning that gives it a very particular spirit of conviviality and sharing.

Aptar strengthens its airless dispensing business with the acquisition of Mega Airless,"Mega Airless has two manufacturing facilities in Germany and one in the United States.  The company has over 30 years of experience and has grown to become a leader in airless dispensing technology with approximately EUR 61 million (about USD 66 million) projected annual revenues for 2015 and the company has achieved EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margins in excess of 30% over the past three years. Under the terms of the agreement, AptarGroup will acquire Mega Airless for an enterprise value of approximately EUR 200 million (USD 218 million). The purchase will be funded with available cash on hand in Europe and an existing revolving credit facility. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the first quarter of this year. “We are very pleased to announce this strategic acquisition which aligns with our disciplined approach of acquiring well-managed, profitable businesses with innovative technology. Their products and the markets they serve are complementary to our own and we see significant opportunities to leverage AptarGroup’s global network to grow this business. Today, dermal applications are growing and evolving. Regulatory agencies in the prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceutical markets, and customers in the beauty and personal care markets, are seeking better ways to control dosing and preserve formulations across a variety of products. This transaction will enable us to shape the future of airless solutions,” said Steve Hagge, AptarGroup President and CEO. With over 50 years of experience, Aptar supplies a broad range of dispensing solutions for the beauty, personal care, home care, prescription drug, consumer health care, injectables, food, and beverage markets. The company is headquartered in Crystal Lake, Illinois, with manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe, Asia and South America and over 13,000 employees worldwide. “Mega Airless is a perfect fit for Aptar as we have complementary products and markets. By joining Aptar, we have a great opportunity to leverage Aptar’s global network, including their regulatory expertise, and continue to grow the airless systems portfolio,” commented Mega Airless CEO, Lucyna Silberstein."
Arcade Beauty’s “gem” Carestia inaugurates a new plant,"Founded in 1883 by the Carestia family, the Grasse-based printing plant got known in the 1980s as the creator of the smelling card, intended for consumers to test a perfume on a blotter impregnated with the fragrance. Printed, decorated, cut, or even pre-perfumed, the blotter has become an integral part of brands’ olfactory marketing. As a real port of entry to the product’s universe, it is designed with incredible creativity to give it an identity. And it is this will to spend a lot of time on research and development and to make high-end products in very large quantities that made Carestia so successful that it eventually became a reference for major groups. The company joined the Arcade Marketing Group in 2013, before it changed its name for Arcade Beauty in 2014. “Becoming part of the Group made it possible for Carestia to optimize its production tool and unique know-how,” explains Philippe Ughetto, Arcade Beauty’s President EMEA. Neutral blotters (those that are printed, but not perfumed) represent 40% of the company’s business, and it also provides the industry with sample single-serving packs, which account for 40% of its turnover. Carestia’s production tool is equipped with machines that comprise the latest technologies and guarantee perfect control of all processes: offset, application of selective UV varnish, embossing, stamped gilding, lamination, cutting, folding, finishing, and conditioning. “Our customers come to us with their own ideas, desires, and worlds to be expressed… then our integrated creation service takes care of transforming these elements into realistic commercial projects that can actually be marketed,” explains Marie-Hélène Marcelli, Director of Carestia. The remaining 20% of the company’s activities are dedicated to the design, development, and production of pre-perfumed promotional objects, mainly on paper or cardboard, but also on textile, leather, ceramic, or wood. The Maison’s unique know-how lies in its impregnation technique and high fragrance quality in all circumstances. Tests are performed in a laboratory before production to validate the quality of the olfactory result: top and back notes, preservation over time depending on the choice of material, ink, varnish… And the perfume must not alter the aesthetic of the print. Once the material has been printed and cut, it is impregnated in the perfuming room with an exclusive technique. Carestia has also recently started using a micro-encapsulation process to deliver the fragrance more gradually. Each testing and production phase is controlled and validated by perfumer-creator Isabelle Burdel to guarantee the perfume is identically reproduced. Carestia’s industrial strategy is adapted to brands’ concerns in terms of presence, differentiation, and marketing. The company’s future prospects are positive, as estimations foresee a 20 million euros progress in its turnover. It should soon invest in its machines for more cutting accuracy and to meet a strong demand for blotters with sophisticated shapes and perfumed pop-ups. New perfuming technologies will also be studied in depth."

Alkos Group: a new plant for Intercosmétiques in 2017,"The Alkos Group has reached a new phase in its development: it has announced the construction of a new plant for its Intercosmétiques branch. The work will start at the end of the first semester 2016 to be finished in summer 2017. “Given the strong growth estimations for the next five years, it had become essential to reorganize and rationalize our premises to be able to keep up with and support the growth of Intercosmétiques’s activities,” the group explains in a press release. Located near Angers, France, Intercosmétiques is a company specialized in the formulation, production, and conditioning of skincare and makeup products. It makes up one of the three units of the Alkos Group, with Sagal, located in Chartres and known for its soaps and perfumed stick deodorants, and Alkos Cosmétiques, a unique makeup pencil producer in France (wood, plastic, and liner pens) settled in Boulogne-sur-Mer. Intercosmétiques employs more than 250 workers and serves the most famous cosmetics brands. It has known a strong growth over the last few years, in particular in 2015, with a turnover increase of 20% to reach more than 31 million euros. Apart from the necessary development of the production capacity and the creation of new manufacturing lines, the Alkos Group adds that building this new plant aims to gather the three current sites, since the cumulative surface area of 11,000 m2 is spread across the whole industrial site right now. This rationalization should help achieve new gains of competitiveness and significantly improve the quality of the environment and the staff’s working conditions. The site chosen, the Parc d’activités Angers-Orgemont, a business park, was previously occupied by motor vehicle equipment manufacturer Valeo. The 16,000 m2 area used by only one tenant will be completely redesigned to meet the cosmetics manufacturer’s needs. And it has another advantage, as it offers huge extension possibilities that could be exploited in the medium-term. “Of course, this new configuration will perfectly meet the requirements of the strictest cosmetics standards,” the group assures. The whole operation represents an 8.5 million euro investment. Intercosmétiques benefits from the support of ALDEV, Angers’s agency for the economic development of its urban community."
Toly China celebrates its 10th anniversary,"Almost 10 years ago to the day, Toly China was opened with just five moulding machines, two assembly lines on only two floors of a brand new building.  Today, Toly occupies all five floors of the building, with 26 moulding machines, 14 assembly lines housed in a clean-room environment, with in-line decoration and some automated assembly. The highlight of the event was the unveiling of Toly’s brand new lacquering and metallizing plant on the top floor of the building. Also on display during the inauguration ceremony were automated assembly lines and all the decorating capabilities that also are available in Toly’s European manufacturing centre in Malta. In his speech, Andy Gatesy, Chairman & CEO of the Toly Group, stated that ’’Toly China is a European style operation, based upon lean manufacturing principles and a much lower head count than a traditional Chinese factory.  With our new internal lacquering and metallizing line, Toly China is now fully integrated and able to support global customers with competitive pricing and strategic launches. With more than 45 years experience from our lead plant in Malta, we are able to transfer technologies and systems to China.’’ Since 2007, Toly China has been ISO 9001 certified and is currently working hard to achieve ISO 14001 certification over the next few months. The Toly Group also has two plants in South Korea - one focussed upon airless packaging whilst a brand new one, opened earlier this year, produces complementary packaging for both skin care and make up brands. The Toly Group continues its expansion in the global market and is showing strong growth in 2015, according to the company’s management.  “With its new innovation centre in Malta, Toly is leading the industry in terms of creative packaging and the company continues to evolve and adapt to the ever changing market.  Innovation is the key to survival but teamwork is the key to success,” claimed the company."
Groupe Bogart takes to distribution,"Other than the original brand, Jacques Bogart, historically presented with the slogan “Je ne crée que pour l’homme” (My creations are only for men), the Groupe Bogart fully owns perfume brands Ted Lapidus and Carven, perfume licenses Chevignon, Lee Cooper, and Naf Naf, and cosmetics brands Méthode Jeanne Piaubert and Stendhal. This eclectic list covers a large part of the selective distribution offering, from the most affordable to the most premium, with Carven Parfums, a brand that was successfully relaunched in 2013. Although the company is open to the possibility of new acquisitions, today Bogart focuses on its development in the distribution sector: the Group has seized the opportunity to purchase several points of sale excluded from the merger between Douglas and Nocibé and has opened about thirty points of sale in France under the brand April, name of the perfumery chain previously acquired in Israel. “Our products are exclusively developed and made in France. By adding distribution, the Groupe Bogart controls the whole chain, down to retail. We wanted to be able to provide our brands with a showcase,” explains Fanny Aimetti, Fragrance Marketing Manager. This multi-brand network of points of sale is spread across the whole territory, though mainly outside the Parisian region, and is “set to develop”, she adds. To date, April owns 37 stores in Israel, 35 in France and 1 in Portugal. The brand Jacques Bogart represents the major part of the Group’s turnover, followed by Ted Lapidus, with 24 perfumed lines and a very active presence abroad. Started in 2010, the Carven olfactory journey is the latest of the group. It concurred with the rebirth of the couture house managed by its dynamic Artistic Director, Guillaume Henry, and it now enjoys a strong notoriety in France, though it remains to be developed worldwide. “We have a very qualitative distribution, but it is centred on Carven Parfums. In terms of development, the brand’s objective depends on the growth of this selective distribution,” Fanny Aimetti comments. The women’s range is composed of Carven Le Parfum, launched in 2013 and created by Francis Kurkdjian, the iconic perfumer-creator of the new creative perfumery, Carven L’Eau de Toilette, and now Carven L’Absolu, a new 2015 fragrance. It is completed with redesigned classics of the house, Ma Griffe and Vétiver, and Carven pour Homme for men. A new perfume is being created to be launched in 2017."
"Ingrid Jackel, at the helm of the brand “Yes To”","Premium Beauty News - A one-of-a-kind adventure for this brand built at first on the combination of beta-carotene and mud from the Dead Sea. Ingrid Jackel - A true success story the US way. To say more “the American way, but its West Coast version”! Ido Leffler and Lance Kalish were undeniably real visionaries in 2006 when they decided to position the brand on this rather bold combination. And on top of it with a tremendous sense of humor. But soon they realized the value of extending it to ingredients coming from other veggies and fruits. But it’s also the brand’s outstanding marketing environment that managed through its originality, to break to some extent, the codes of the industry. The starting principle is simple: skin absorbs much of what you put on it, so we believe it’s important to care as much about what you put on your body as what you put in it. Our formulas are truly natural, and we’re proud to be up front and fully transparent about it! Literally, front and center on all our products you’ll find our seal showing each and every product is at least 95 % natural! Our products are also formulated without parabens, phthalates, and SLS, plus packaged in recyclable packaging whenever possible. Our team of skincare experts combine awesome natural ingredients with the latest and greatest formulation recipes to make sure that our products deliver on what you want - whether that’s cleansing, moisturizing, or blemish zapping. Depending on product type and intended use, we test a variety of our products for certain areas of concern (irritation, hypoallergenic / sensitivity testing, dermatologist tested, tear free, non-comedogenic, and clinical tests). All of our testing is performed in third party testing laboratories and never tested on animals. Premium Beauty News - In any case, the concept works! Ingrid Jackel - Indeed, yes! “Yes To” products make skin feel good while bringing a smile to your face! 95% natural (at least) and 100% positive. From the soothing, spa-like scent of cucumbers to the silky (never greasy) texture of our moisturizers, what better way to start (or finish) each day than doing it with products that feel and smell fantastic? We are pretty proud how many people have fallen in love with “Yes To” products, from the lady next to us on the bus to beauty editors. We say “Yes To” super-natural beauty products that work, spread smiles, and give back. “Yes To” products work because we never compromise. “Yes To” makes you smile (read our packaging!) We want to inspire people to take ordinary life moments and make them extraordinary by doing two things: a) smiling more (let’s see it!) 
b) saying “Yes” at least once a day! “Yes To” believes in giving back. We are therefore committed to giving back a portion of our company profits to the “Yes To” Seed Fund, whose goal is to inspire people to lead healthier, more positive lives. Premium Beauty News - Your goals? Ingrid Jackel - Double our sales, nothing else! We already operate on the segments of face care, body care, hair care... after a shower, after exercising, at work and at home, in front of our mirror or in a bathroom ... in short, from head to toe, opportunities are many for Yes To to offer a unique and positive sensory experience, and we won’t miss this opportunity, but without taking ourselves too seriously of course!"
Rituals reassured after setting up in France,"It is in 1999, during a seminar at the Chinese Pagoda in Paris, that Dutchman Raymond Cloosterman, who then worked for Unilever, had the idea to create a daily, holistic concept inspired from Asian rituals and combining body and home cosmetics. A range was developed in coherence with the brand’s philosophy: transforming each daily gesture into unique relaxing moments. Today, it counts almost 400 products – body and face care, makeup with precious stones, tea, candles, home perfumes. If it took several years for the first store set up in Amsterdam to find its own customers, after seven years, the store is now successful, which made it possible to open more and more points of sale over the past few years, first in the Netherlands, and then in Belgium, throughout Europe, in the Middle East, and in Brazil. Rituals is now present in 25 countries, with more than 400 points of sale and 1,000 stands. The brand also distributes its products through the selective channel, e-commerce, and travel retail – about fifty airports and 4 to 5-star hotels. It has positioned itself as an “affordable luxury brand” and reached a turnover of 250 million euros in 2014. Reinforced by an annual 30% growth that confirms the strength of the concept and by the high turnover of its e-store, which already existed in France, Rituals finally decided to try and enter the difficult French market in May 2015, with a first opening on Rue Vieille du Temple, in the Marais quarter of Paris. Two new points of sale were inaugurated at the Italie 2 shopping mall, in the south of the French capital, and in Boulogne, west of Paris. “We have very positive feedback in France. Our results are much beyond expectations, with a higher turnover than what we had estimated. That is why we have planned to open 12 new wholly-owned stores in Paris and across France in 2016”, Sandrine Mignaux comments. Lyon and Lille are top of the list, and so is the large, 143m2 point of sale under the new canopy of central mall Les Halles, expected for the beginning of April. “We have been widening our ranges with makeup and home clothes, so we intend to open larger areas. None of our future stores will be less than 70m2. It is important for us that all references are gathered in the same place to give a thorough image of our concept”, Sandrine Mignaux explains. In parallel, the brand is present with a gift offering in all Sephora stores in France, and is negotiating with a department store chain. The purchase experience in store is one of the main levers of the brand, which combines an environment full of noble, warm materials with a very personalized reception: customers are offered a hand massage and tea. “Empathy and kindness are the main criteria for recruiting our sales force,” Sandrine Mignaux specifies. Word-of-mouth is enhanced by the customer experience and the qualitative and natural positioning of affordable products, and will be facilitated by several publicity events organized throughout the year."
Atelier Cologne inaugurates a third Parisian store on the Left Bank,"Located in the heart of the Left Bank quarter, this new workshop spreads across 50m2, in a new setting. The Colognes Absolues are displayed on painter cases, and a wall composed of dozens of leather, bright-coloured cases highlights the importance of the art of gifts and personalization to Atelier Cologne. This new area is Atelier Cologne’s sixth wholly-owned store in France and around the world, including three in Paris, two in New York City, and a brand new one in Hong Kong. Driven by their young brand’s dynamics, the two founders are considering reaching the number of twelve stores within the next two years, mainly abroad, in particular in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Dubai, Moscow, Shanghai, Seoul… This plan does not include any opening in a French region, although the brand is present across the whole territory via the Sephora network. “Opening a store in the city of Toulouse, for example, requires as much energy as opening one in Seoul, but the return on investment is definitely not the same”, Christophe Cervasel explains. “France is the most difficult market in the world. In the United States, or Asia, people are culturally open to novelty. In France, we have a culture of tradition. Atelier Cologne is a new French Maison de Parfum, and the weight of the Made in France label has much more impact beyond our borders. I wish the French were aware of this,” he adds. Thanks to its presence in more than 35 countries, via the travel retail network and on Air France flights, Atelier Cologne will end the year 2015 with a 14 million euro turnover, 85% of which results from international sales. 700,000 bottles have been sold since the Maison was created, and a range of hotel amenities was developed in partnership with Groupe GM. Atelier Cologne: A unique Gift Card From 60 euros of credited value, the gift card is offered in a ""Discovery Kit"", a metal box decorated with an image of the first Atelier Cologne boutique and containing 12 mini-sprays from the brand’s bestsellers. Whoever receives the voucher can therefore easily choose his favourite perfume to retrieve it online or in store. V.G."

"Paris Mon Amour, or how to put Paris in a bottle","“Strangely enough, there was no perfume line designed around Paris, although the French capital benefits from a strong image abroad and plays a role that is widely recognized in the perfumery world! So, I decided to represent the French capital’s iconic places, those that best evoke the French spirit in the world’s imagination, with elegant, very feminine, both qualitative and affordable perfumes,” explains Carole Rannou, creator of the brand, Paris Mon Amour. In January 2014, after more than 20 years working as the Artistic or Marketing and Creation Director for various French perfume and cosmetics brands, she launched a line of perfumes to take both young and older people for a love walk around Paris. The idea was to offer Parisian and foreign customers high quality, 100% Made in France fragrances at an affordable price. In keeping with the brand’s positioning, Paris Mon Amour perfumes are available in outlets located near the most popular tourist areas of the French capital: Galeries Lafayette, the Champs-Élysées, the Eiffel Tower, Parisian airports, and Nocibé perfume stores. On the global scale, they are already available in the United States, Turkey, and Indonesia. “Obviously, the development of export sales is our top priority,” Carole Rannou emphasizes. “The concept is popular, and we are actually negotiating with many distributors. We mainly target European countries, the Middle East, in particular the United Arab Emirates, and Asia.” Right now, the brand has three fragrances available in 50ml bottles with a modern design and decorated with a jewel to be carried and preserved like the memory of a precious moment: – Eiffel Kiss, a sensual perfume with chypre, floral, fruity, and musky notes (bergamot orange, red fruit, and violet leaves as top notes, jasmine sambac, rose, violet, neroli, and iris as middle notes, and sandalwood, patchouli, musk, tonka, and white cedar as back notes)
– Place Vendôme in Love, a real floral bouquet (water bloom, blackcurrant, crumpled leaves, citrus fruit, ylang, cyclamen, apple, rose, orange blossom, vanilla, patchouli, sandalwood, musk)
– Romantic Montmartre, a glamourous, voluptuous, romantic fragrance with musky notes, white tea, and vanilla The next step will consist in widening the range by launching a new perfume, Chérie Élysées, in January 2016, and then new concepts around body mists and makeup… A beautiful love story that will not end soon…"
"“Our objective is to provide Brazilian consumers with safer nail polish and a broader offering”, Alexandre Miasnik, Fiabila","Premium Beauty News - In 2014, Fiabila announced the purchase of a plant in the suburbs of São Paulo. What about this Brazilian adventure? Alexandre Miasnik -  It is an adventure indeed! We initiated very intensive work in this large plant – more than 7,500 m2 – to make it comply both with local standards and our international requirements, which we developed thanks to our long experience. The work that will allow us to start our activities will be over in December, and we are receiving the required licences. Premium Beauty News - How is this plant structured? Alexandre Miasnik - Our activity will start in early 2016 with the tinting of thixotroped bases with colouring solutions mainly imported from France, and with conditioning, which will be performed on two lines fitted with the same equipment as those we use in France. Then we will gradually get to seven lines. In the course of the second semester 2016, our site will be ready for the local manufacturing of thixotroped bases and skincare products. The time period in-between is due to the very high technicity of the production tool, as it is modelled on the one we use in Maintenon, in France, and to the fact that all local raw materials still do not meet Fiabila’s quality and price level requirements. Eventually, the objective is to integrate all productions on the local level. As for safety and the environment, whether it be for laboratory control, production in closed circuit to reduce contamination risks to a minimum, or safety, with cutting-edge systems in case of fire or if materials fall over, we have installed in Brazil the exact same equipment we have been using elsewhere. The production tool also helps limit handling and releases into the atmosphere to a minimum. We will treat Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) after we have started our activities and concrete measures have been taken. Premium Beauty News - How important is Brazil for Fiabila’s international development strategy? Alexandre Miasnik - Our latest statistics confirm the essential role of the Brazilian nail polish market. That is why Fiabila had to settle in this country with a production tool adapted both to the importance of this market and to the increasing need for quality products. We have been implementing the procedures we apply in France on the local level, and we commit to strictly comply with European and American regulations, among others. Today, Fiabila is the only company to be able to meet these requirements, and we definitely intend to settle firmly in Brazil, just like we did on the other major markets. Premium Beauty News - Brazilian women’s taste for nail polish is a widely known fact. Brazil is the first consumer in the world in terms of volume, but the second one for value, behind the United States, with very low prices. Is it moving upmarket, like other categories? Alexandre Miasnik - Most products are sold by a few local brands that sell low-end goods for very low prices. But we have observed a move upmarket for certain ranges for over a year now. In fact, a lot of Brazilian brands suffer from allergies, and an increasing number of them would like to have “4 or 5-Free” products, which are free from specific ingredients that are de-listed elsewhere. Besides, the current offering remains limited in terms of colours, effects, and skincare products. Therefore, the move upmarket will depend on safer products, but also a broader offering and, above all, quality goods, which until now could not be much seen on the market. Fiabila does have an essential role to play. Premium Beauty News - The cosmetics market in Brazil has known a slowdown, everyone knows it. But certain segments like makeup are still dynamic. How do you think the market will change? Alexandre Miasnik - Beauty has a very particular resonance for Brazilian women, even the least well-off of them, and the fact that certain products are extremely cheap clearly explains the dynamism of this market. Prospects remain very encouraging, and Fiabila is ready for the challenge."
Millennium Fragrances diversifies their perfume lines for children,"For the end of the year, the Kaloo perfume lines, associated with fluffy toys and designed for babies and children aged 0-6, have been completed with a new premium range presented in an innovative, exclusive bottle: “Les amis de Kaloo”. Available as a scented water – without alcohol – or an eau de toilette, with a low quantity of alcohol, the bottles are fitted with a diffusing cap made of patented ceramic to spread the fragrance throughout the child’s room. And the brand has announced another innovation for March 2016: a new bottle for the Kokeshi Japanese dolls designed by Jeremy Scott, Moschino’s designer, who is fond of the kawai world. Created from scratch around the concept of small Japanese dolls, the Kokeshi brand targets teenagers aged 12-18 and regularly renews its partnership with a renowned designer to create the five figurines of the collection. The new line is directly inspired from the Californian designer’s textile collections. A doll and a message are associated with each fragrance created in collaboration with Mane and Robertet: Tonka illustrates power, Bambou, friendship, Lotus, beauty, Lichee, love, and Cheery, luck. Exclusively made in France, Millennium Fragrances perfumes are distributed by 1,800 selective perfume shops and 400 stores dedicated to children, in France, but also in ten countries around the world, 300 stores located in airports, and 43 airlines. The group has shown an 8% increase in its turnover this year, compared to 2014."

SIMP continues its transformation,"Taken over in July 2011 by Alain Blondel and Eric Bardonecchia, the staff has increased twofold in four years. With 35 employees to date, the company should, according to its leaders, increase its workforce again by the end of next year. SIMP owns 17 granted or pending patents: it creates and designs every year a collection of applicators consisting of 4/5 stock and / or customized new models to its customers, while also expanding its reach overseas with the development of the North and South American markets. To support this industrial globalization, SIMP inaugurated last June in Mexico, in the city of Aguascalientes, a new 1,700 sqm plant dedicated to the production and assembly of components for the cosmetic sector, and more specifically rubber wipers. To support and anticipate this growth, SIMP significantly expanded its R & D department and invested heavily in capacity equipment and disruptive equipment: with a fully automated machine park consisting of 29 plastic injection presses, including two new ones acquired this year, 17 machines for the rubber production and the use of block transfer injection for the high capacity production of extremely precise parts, the company will produce more than 300 million of these plastic and rubber parts this year, that is, a 20% increase over last year! ""Innovation is the lifeblood of our progression,"" emphasises Alain Blondel, ""and in 2016, we will invest even more, and also in the production of bi-material parts."" ""Injected plastic mascara brushes and rubber wipers remain the company’s core business (70% of sales),"" explains Alain Blondel, ""but we are increasingly diversifying our activities in the production of other types of applicators for skincare and pharmaceutical products. More than 20% of our products are intended for other sectors than cosmetics."""
Mascara Plus extends its expertise,"The company does 60 per cent of its business with cosmetics companies based in Europe and the U.S.;  the remainder is spread throughout the globe. Mascara Plus is located in Inzago on the outskirts of Milan in a new 2,400 sqm building. The facility, which is GMP/ISO certified includes two state of the art fibre brush machines that can produce 150,000 custom brushes per day. The new plant can also generate 2,500 kg of bulk product per day - or 100,000 finished piece - ready to ship. Mascara Plus also organizes focused workshops where customers can come in and see the products first-hand, request design modifications, and get new prototypes in hand within hours. “Clients really appreciate this,” says Chant. “It significantly cuts down on product development time and, as a result, reduces costs. We create the formulations and brushes to the specific needs of customers, and we also provide filling services and develop also customizable, packaging solutions.” The company for example, has developed “Double Brush”, a new mascara applicator. The brush design includes two distinct elements with different areas of fibre density. A large distance between fibres creates volume in the applied mascara; a small distance gives lengthening and curling. The two areas are oriented at 90-degree intervals, so that users automatically get both effects with a single brush stroke. Similarly, the company’s “Double Play” mascara includes an innovative double formulation that includes higher viscosity for lengthening as well as softening agents for volumizing. “That allows the end customer to avoid a trade off between those two factors,” says Chant. Notably, Mascara Plus is the only contract manufacturer of mascara that produces its own brushes designed and based upon its unique bulk formulations, leading to a perfect synergy between brush and mascara formula. As a recent marketing campaign puts it, “We make both hardware and software.” Now that the company has established core strengths in mascara - its speciality since the company’s beginning - it is now expanding out into other cosmetics, including lip gloss, foundation, and eye shadow. Mascara Plus already has clients for all product lines. Regardless of whether the company is working on mascara, lip gloss, eye shadow, or foundation, Chant says that it will always rely on what it does best—strong product development, technical expertise, and customer service. “Those things are in our DNA,” he says. “They apply no matter what we’re producing.”"
"""MakeUp in"" trade shows record their 1,000th exhibitor","Premium Beauty News - Fifteen editions of “MakeUp In” and 1,000 exhibitors, what an adventure!  By the way, what is the figure concerning the number of visitors? Sandra Maguarian - Cumulatively over the six previous years, more than 27,000! Jean-Yves Bourgeois and I, as you can imagine, are very proud of having reached such a level. Like any adventure, it was hard to imagine six years ago that we would reach these figures. A proof if need be that the concept is good. Premium Beauty News - Precisely, why is it good? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - We already had occasion to say, but it’s always worth repeating that MakeUp in’s are events that are centred on the entire make-up and skincare sector, and nothing else. This means that visitors in a few hours can get a complete overview of what this industry has to offer, from ingredients to accessories including formulation and packaging. What is important is the balance between formulation manufacturers who represent the bulk of our exhibitors and other industrial sectors (ingredients, packagings and accessories). This balance is crucial as it determines the type of visitorship which, in turn, consists mostly of people coming from Marketing departments (almost 60%), followed by Purchasing and Development teams. This ""privileged"" access of exhibitors to Marketing teams, can only be found in our various MakeUp In’s across the world. Premium Beauty News - What explains the popularity of your events among brands? Sandra Maguarian - Because with our MakeUp In events they not only find the formulation manufacturers they are looking for, but they also can take advantage of an atmosphere ""of its own"" that we have always worked on and privileged, by creating many make-up animations thanks to the participation, among others, of schools but also of numerous make-up artists. Let’s say ""An atmosphere"" that’s closer to ""Fashion"" with a capital ""F"" than to an umpteenth traditional Beauty show. Premium Beauty News - Speaking of traditional beauty events, there is indeed no lack of offer! Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Each exhibitor, each visitor at the four MakeUp In’s in the world is aware of that, because he actually experienced it himself. This quality and high level of contacts is seen nowhere else. Experience it! You just need to visit one of our shows to get a grasp of the business level at the stands. It’s true that there is an increasing number of events taking place across the world. But if new ones are created, it means that the others are not satisfactory. The question on large or multisectorial shows can be raised. But this is not the subject here! Our strategy is clear! The whole make-up and skincare industry, and nothing but the make-up and skincare industry! When you start to cast the net far and wide, you’re bound to failure. Every packaging trade show, no matter how successful, remains a packaging trade show with ""packaging"" visitors. And a multisectorial trade show remains a multisectorial trade show. For my part, I have never seen exhibitors express themselves as positively and as spontaneously in writing on these events, as they do with us! And even when everything is not perfect, we do not hesitate to say so! Premium Beauty News - Indeed the recent MakeUp in New York was not perfect! Sandra Maguarian -  It’s true! But we explained why and drew necessary conclusions from it! Precisely the new venue is magnificent. Not to say exceptional, entirely in the image of what we have always strived to achieve so far and what we will continue to focus on in the future. And Jean-Yves Bourgeois and I know that manufacturers trust us. Because along the years, a sort of particular alchemy has developed between us. This comes from this mutual commitment that brings us together four times a year. A commitment to make this event as successful as possible. Nothing more, nothing less! Premium Beauty News - You have a new event starting in 2016 in Los Angeles! Yet another one? Jean-Yves Bourgeois - Don’t be mistaken! First, you must know that if we created this new event, it’s because we were asked to! It’s as simple as that. When we created MakeUp in Paris, we were asked to create MakeUp in New York. Ditto for Seoul and Sao Paulo. For Los Angeles, the picture is different. Demand for an event on the West Coast was very high. But we didn’t want to create ""another event"" in North America. So we chose this formula that is closer to high-level networking intended for a highly targeted population in a format where are more privileged meetings, conferences and workshops than the ""exhibition"" side itself. Hence the name ""MakeUp in Action"". And it’s going to be successful for sure! Premium Beauty News - Your plans for 2016? Sandra Maguarian - Long live 2016! This will be our seventh year! The age of reason! And I want to thank all the make-up and skincare manufacturers for having accompanied us so far and for continuing to do so next year. And we can only repeat what they already know, ""Together, make each of these events as successful as possible for the greatest benefit of this marvellous industry."""
Lady Green gets in beauty salons and takes interest in boys,"According to the opinions of the 200 young girls consulted on a participatory basis for the development of the brand and its range, teens expected “efficient and fun organic products”. Playful, girly, dedicated, formulated and made in France, and Ecocert-certified, Lady Green managed to conquer young girls’ hearts with a range that now counts about fifteen skincare and makeup products and accessories. Distributed in selective perfume shops, organic stores, parapharmacies, and concept stores, the brand also quickly found itself its own place in beauty salons and abroad. It is present in 12 countries, in particular in Asia, and 60% of its turnover comes from export. However, the brand plans to reinforce its presence in France, especially on the network of beauty salons, spas, and thalassotherapy centres, where demand is growing fast. This channel is eager to differentiate itself with an alternative product and treatment offering that has proven popular among the younger generation. “There are real expectations for a targeted offering, but also for mother/daughter products sold in pairs, or packages for an afternoon with girlfriends. Our products and price positioning suit this demand perfectly well,” explains Adrien Vinet, the co-founder of the brand with Virginie Vinet and Operations Director. In the middle of 2014, Lady Green counted about 20 beauty salons working as consignees, and it should have 150 of them by the end of 2015. The brand aims for twice this figure in 2016. A purifying, detoxifying, deliberately short (30 minutes) skincare protocol was developed and will be available as from EUR 25. Beauticians will be able to get products designed for treatments for 15 to 40% less than the selling price, and a book/guidelines will help them provide the treatments and beauty orders. Next year will see many new product launches, including a BB cream and a body range that will be both for sale and available as a treatment, but it will mainly be marked with the boys’ version of the Lady Green concept. To Adrien Vinet, the possibility of targeting male teens for whom there is no offering is a real opportunity. “As is already the case in Asia, today boys are willing to take care of their own skins, and they do not hesitate to enter beauty salons”, he explains. Of course, the range under development was renamed and will comprise adapted formulas. “Just like for Lady Green, we have adopted a participatory approach and are surveying our future consumers to develop our range, but we already have a name for it. It is a bit harder than for girls, because boys express themselves less easily, but their reactions are promising”, affirms Adrien Vinet."
LF Beauty inaugurates its first ‘Creative Days’ in Paris,"Premium Beauty News - So you created a 200 square meter journey for each customer that focused on three major themes. What were the themes? François Camilli - Yes. Our staging focused on three themes that we called: ""One Stop Shop"", ""Local Sourcing"" and ""Innovation"". Premium Beauty News - Let’s start with the ""One Stop Shop"" theme. Tell us about it. François Camilli - The idea was to present our multi-category offer of products (make-up, skincare, fragrance) and services (formulation, filling, primary and secondary packaging, POS material, instrumental beauty), as a truly comprehensive, one-stop offerboth in terms of packaging and formulation. In addition to our recent partnership with the Korean beauty and R&D company Cosmecca, we have factories in the US, UK, China, Indonesia and Thailand, supported by R&D laboratories in the  UK, China and Thailand from which key products and innovative ideas were presented. For example, we presented multi-material and multi-shape face care masks that had various features like moisturizing, relaxing, revitalizing, detox, and so forth. Premium Beauty News - What do you mean by ""Local Sourcing""? François Camilli -  It is important to know that we currently offer alternatives to products manufactured in China, and instead work with local partners. This is important to meeting expectations of the European market. We already have a network of manufacturers in France to meet requirements in point of sales (POS) material for pop-up and temporary events, and we recently signed a partnership with a French industrial expert in the design and injection of thermoplastic parts with high added value. Premium Beauty News - And you are also a champion of innovation! François Camilli - ""Champion"" is maybe not the right word. The fact is, we let innovation drive as much of the visitor journey as possible and in many areas such as digital, interactivity, consumer experience, light, product customization and eco-design. We presented novel ideas, concepts and achievements in each category of products and services, and this was applied across all areas. Sarah Romay - One of the highlights for our guests was the ability to see and touch a wall of materials with nearly 20 different innovative textures intended for accessories, packaging or boxes. Premium Beauty News - So the customer journey ended in style? François Camilli - It closed on a creative workshop that enabled us to collect their feedback on the journey, take note of their favourite products, and determine next steps. It’s important that we support our customers in their differentiation process, to anticipate their needs and deliver added value. Sarah Romay - This first ‘Creative Days’ event was a great opportunity to show our customers the different trades and innovations of LF Beauty. Beyond simply proposing a showroom dedicated to each of our activities, we recreated a common space full of inspiration, creation and collaboration called, the Idea Lab. It makes us tap into our five senses and provides us with all the tools necessary to imagine the products and packaging of tomorrow - including a 3D experiment station- while also taking inspiration from bygone packaging. We have to thank the company Musée à la Carte for lending us some magnificent collection pieces: powder compacts, beauty boxes, lipstick and perfume cases of the 30s or 19th Century… and not to mention a beauty spot box and a chatelaine of the 18th Century!"
France Lab to keep developing as part of the Marie Claire Group,"It has no plant, but a marketing and design creation workshop as well as a research and development laboratory near Paris, and customers all around the world: founded in 2007, perfume and cosmetics creation agency France Lab made itself known for its capacity for innovation and product quality. Among the agency’s customers can be found distributors seeking a comprehensive service to develop their private labels, brands aspiring to diversification, but also cosmetics manufacturers looking for innovative products, an outside perspective, and insight, or young designers searching for expertise and advice. “Our originality is based on the fact that we gather both creative (marketing/design) and technical (R&D/packaging engineering/purchase-development/regulations) teams and skills under the same roof, which makes it possible to offer our customers innovative services (product concepts and ideas from the marketing, technology, or packaging perspectives). We can meet all our customers’ needs. We design brands and products, and we manage projects from the brand’s identity and DNA to formulations and retail communication and image, including design and packaging development. We can even advise customers on distribution and guide them through the marketing phase,” explains Serge Dantas, Deputy Managing Director. More than a creation studio or a mere formulation laboratory, France Lab endeavours to provide real turnkey solutions including brand strategy, creation, development, and manufacturing, via different industrial partners. “We view ourselves as true beauty architects. We usually work on long-term projects over several months, or sometimes even years, because we need time to design and successfully establish a brand on such a competitive market as that of perfumes and cosmetics,” Serge Dantas underlines. Today, the company counts about twenty employees, and it entered into an international development phase one year and a half ago, which materialized with the establishment of a three-employee subsidiary in New York. It also has a representative office in Hong Kong, and is considering founding a subsidiary in China. “Our portfolio of Asian customers needs France Lab’s expertise in the development and formulation of innovative, high-end skincare products. As an example, we have just developed a private label range of about twenty formulas for a high-profile Chinese operator in the hotel business sector.” France Lab’s acquisition by the Marie Claire Group should help the agency provide its customers with the extensive know-how and visibility offered by its new parent company, but it should also stimulate its international development, using the luxury and beauty advertisers portfolio managed by the group. Likewise, France Lab does not exclude the possibility of external growth either, as it would help it position itself faster on the local level. As for the Marie Claire Group, they intend to expand their own diversification strategy by strengthening the service offer available to brands via its Beauty Factory, which used to be focused on market research."
Strand Cosmetics Europe to invest one third of net sales,"Quite an enviable track record for this French company, which today employs more than 150 people spread out across its headquarters and production site in Lentilly on the outskirts of Lyon, France. The current year looks very promising too with a turnover up by 10% over last year and the signing of several major contracts with both make-up and skin-care brands.  ""We also have excellent prospects in the OTC cosmetic niche,"" emphasizes Éric Bouvier the CEO, ""a segment we decided to invest more thoroughly."" The end of 2015 truly looks like a turning point for Strand Cosmetics Europe, both in terms of industrial investments, with an increased automation of its packaging lines and also on a human level with the appointment of a new Sales and Marketing director, Denis Richard Orliange, a new laboratory manager for make-up applications (Nicolas Verrecchia) and finally of a Pharmacologist in charge of industrialization and packaging techniques (Matthieu Roux). ""These appointments create a real momentum with regards our industrial, commercial and research activities,"" explains Éric Bouvier, ""of which we are already seeing the positive effects, particularly with our portfolio of key accounts."" These “human investments” come together with important industrial investments that are already visible, with not only an increased automation of the packaging lines but also a 3,600 sqm extension of the facilities on the Lentilly site planned in 2017. ""These industrial buildings will enable us to comply with the GMP standards and the new premises will house the R&D, Marketing and Regulatory affairs departments,” concludes Éric Bouvier.  ""Our philosophy is clear, he insists, we want to continue to affirm and strengthen our image of quality, seriousness, reliability and competence across all levels of our expertise, especially for technical and regulatory matters, to stand as unavoidable players and always position ourselves as leaders in our field. The validation this year by the FDA of both this expertise and competence is a true sign of recognition that we appreciate to its true value."""
Designer Parfums diversifies its brand stable,"At the end of the 90s, the Mehta family at the head of the Shaleen group decided to shift from perfumery trading to buying brands. They created Designers Parfums in 2002, after having bought the Worth Paris brand. Then came Jean-Louis Scherrer, German fine leather brand Étienne Aigner, which they purchased from Puig, Ghost, the English fragrance brand for young girls, and of course, in 2011, Jean Patou, the iconic French luxury brand that was put on hold for a decade by Procter & Gamble: Designer Parfums purchased the whole brand (perfumery and couture) and managed to revive its perfume department with the famous Joy, 1000 Sublime, and the new editions of the Heritage Collection. Meanwhile, the group completed its stable of licensed selective brands with Porsche Design, which it acquired from Clarins, or Naomi Campbell Perfumes. As for distribution, Designer Parfums associated with local group Lux Brand on the North American market. Together, they chose to purchase brands that were well-established on the territory. That is how Ari by Ariana Grande perfumes and professional hair care brand Fred Fekkai got caught in the group’s net. But the first step in the care sector was taken with the purchase of DDF dermatological products. “We are proud to add these leading beauty brands to our portfolio of French heritage brands,” Dilesh Mehta explains. Boosted by the successful rebirth of the Patou perfume house, the Designer Parfums group managed to build itself a varied catalogue in only a few years, and is now strategically positioned on the market. “We hope to diversify our portfolio and be present on all market segments of the beauty industry: middle, prestige, and niche markets,” the manager concludes. We will keep an eye on their progress as well as on the possible relaunching of the Couture department of Maison Jean Patou."
Schwan-Stabilo Cosmetics inaugurates its new U.S. plant,"The factory building, a true architectural masterpiece, reflects the high level the Group is seeking to reach in the cosmetics sector .“Our intention is to convey a distinct and honest message to our customers, employees and neighbours: a relentless commitment to exceptional quality, a spirit of innovation, and exceptional service and value,” says Dr. Jörg Karas, General Manager of Schwan-Stabilo Cosmetics GmbH & Co. KG. These feelings are captured in the company’s corporate slogan “inspiration engineered”, which is displayed on the building’s front façade. “The first impression given to visitors by our premises is an important factor in Schwan’s brand position and is one of the group’s main goals,” comments Dr. Jörg Karas. The facility supports highly automated production and provides ease of maintenance while complying with applicable industry regulations. In order to be environmentally responsible and sustainable, the company incorporated high performance construction and energy efficient systems. As the US headquarters for Schwan Cosmetics, this facility seamlessly houses cross function teams for corporate administration, new product research and development, product manufacturing, distribution and employee amenities. The areas for each of these teams are thoughtfully integrated and collaborative in layout and connectivity. “As a new-comer to the Murfreesboro area, we are looking forward to being a good community steward, providing a progressive work environment and building strong relationships within the community for decades,” says Holli Montgomery, Managing Director forSchwan Cosmetics USA, Inc. Since 1927, the Schwan-Stabilo Cosmetics GmbH & Co. KG has stood for innovative cosmetic products, customer focus and a comprehensive range of services. During the fiscal year 2014/15, sales have increased by seven percent up to around 350 million USD. The Group employs a total of 2,900 employees in eleven production facilities worldwide. The Schwan-Stabilo Cosmetics GmbH & Co. KG is a subgroup of the 160-year-old internationally-operating Schwan-Stabilo Group with its headquarter in Heroldsberg (near Nuremberg), Germany. The family-owned Corporate Group operates in three independent business areas – cosmetics, writing instruments and outdoor equipment – and is, nowadays, run by its fifth generation. “The Group’s special structure guarantees our financial independence, making it possible to plan over the long term and to undertake future-oriented investments,” declares Dirk Schwanhäußer, Chairman of the Advisory Board, Schwanhäußer Industrieholding GmbH & Co.

Schwan-Stabilo which is, today, among the 100 best German medium-sized companies, yielded a sales volume of around 700 million USD during the fiscal year 2014/15, and employs more than 4,400 people worldwide of which almost 50 percent work in German locations."
"Francois Luscan, Albéa: “We need a long-term vision!”","Premium Beauty News - Is it not a bit tricky to be the Director of a group that weighs sixteen thousand people and still preach for agility? François Luscan -  Being agile is both being reactive and flexible. With the turmoil we are experiencing in the world and on the market, it is absolutely essential to always be ready to adapt, and quickly. This is true for service, which must be even more reliable and flexible, for costs, which must be even more competitive everywhere, for the development of new products, which must be both fast and rigorous, for reactivity to our customers’ supply and demand, and for the decisions regarding the best adapted production site, depending on both technologies and the deadlines expected. The idea is to implement effective industrial, commercial, and digital organizational structures, among others. Nevertheless, a large group cannot lose its strength and solidity! I am absolutely convinced that size is not incompatible with agility: we need to understand our challenges, be ambitious as regards our targets, and be able to commit both in the short and long terms. This is possible if we have strong teams, an expertise that is really present, and available means. Premium Beauty News - Customers are at the core of your strategy, more than ever. François Luscan -  Customers have always been at the centre of Albéa’s world! Some of them are international brands present both commercially and industrially all around the world. Almost half our portfolio is composed of regional or local customers. But today, more than ever, all our customers place the emphasis on service and competitiveness – in addition, of course, to the operational performance we always owe them. And none of them has the time to wait for a supplier to adapt to their needs, even if it is their first partner. That is why we endeavour to define the best business model in all our activities in order to meet their changing expectations: which organization, which product portfolio, which planning for our plants, which equipment… Premium Beauty News - Social and environmental responsibility is another important aspect of the missions you have committed to for a long time. François Luscan - Social and environmental responsibility (SER) has been an essential issue for us for more than 10 years, whether for our employees, customers, suppliers, and communities. It is really at the core of Albéa’s strategy, and it comprises multiple initiatives and endless projects focused on our men and women, our industrial operations, our products, and of course, our customers, suppliers, communities, and other partners in our ecosystem. But we do believe the approach must be collective, maybe even by working with rivals on standards and regulations, and it is fundamental to have a long-term vision. Premium Beauty News - Another strength: innovation… on all levels! François Luscan - Innovation covers several areas. It must be technical, whether it applies to new products or new industrial processes. It must also be developed in design, and we produce more and more “standard” packaging that stick to market trends and are quickly available, at the right price. Ultimately, as far as specific developments are concerned, the idea is to make projects reliable, even those that are extremely complex. And let’s not forget about patents: we are proud of being part of the first 50 companies registering patents in France! Innovation represents a large part of our investments. Premium Beauty News - Being both local and present all around the globe… How do you adapt to the economic and monetary turmoil in the world?  François Luscan - You are going to be a bit surprised, but I think it is normal to experience turmoil. Some of the countries you are referring to have known a rapid expansion, so it is only natural for them to have a slowdown, and it is a good thing that the standard of living, the salaries, urbanization, and industrialization are improving in these areas. Of course, we must adapt quickly and as best we can, and sometimes it is hard. But just like we have been serving our customers for 50 years, sometimes the very same ones, Albéa’s vision goes much farther than six months, one year, or five years ahead! Obviously, once these fluctuations have impacted our customers’ supply decisions, they indirectly impact our industrial strategy, in particular our production capacity. Again, it is a matter of being agile and transferring our equipment from one site to another, if possible, adjusting our organizations if needed, investing in some equipment… This cannot be done in only a few days, and it can prove more costly and complex than what our customers expect, and what we hoped for. And yet, again, it is all about agility: we must be able to provide the best offer to all our customers, wherever they are in the world: the product they need, at the best total cost, in the shortest time possible, with the best service and quality. Of course, and this is the strength of a large group like ours, we also provide a real investment capacity, resources in innovation and development, strong industrial processes, an ambitious SER policy, let alone a solid, stable team with people they know and who are trusted by the organization.
As I said, these are the fundamentals for sustainable development! Premium Beauty News - Will the companies in your sector keep congregating? François Luscan - To me, it is inevitable! And I am also talking about alliances. Of course, it does not mean the future is only in the hands of large industrial groups: regional, well-performing, and innovative companies will always play a crucial role. But the sector’s major brands are also getting together; they are seeking to capture new markets and territories, and they need strong suppliers to support them and invest together with them in buildings, equipment, innovation, industrial processes, technical expertise, or regulatory affairs…"
The American manufacturer Oxygen Development acquires German manufacturer Carefull Colours,"It may be recalled that the Oxygen Development company is a leading private label manufacturer and service provider for colour cosmetics, skin and hair care products, headquartered in Palm Beach, Florida, USA. Starting over 15 years ago, Oxygen presently employs 650 employees in two manufacturing sites. ""Working in close partnership with several prominent brands of the worldwide cosmetics business, we operate mainly in the United States and on European and Latin American markets,” explains Stefano Castelletti, who joined the Oxygen Development Group recently. “We have developed our business by focusing on outstanding, innovative products, product quality and superior customer service – a recipe for success that allowed Oxygen to invest in new state of the art manufacturing facilities and extensive production capacity in the area of colour cosmetics, supporting companies’ successful growth strategy."" As for the German company, Carefull Colours Produktions GmbH, it is a traditional, leading private label manufacturer for colour cosmetics based in Burgwedel, Germany. Founded some 40 years ago by Cosmolab, USA, Carefull Colours’ business developed considerably after the takeover by the current owner M. Kurt Pilchowski some 25 years ago, to become an important partner to various cosmetics companies in Europe. According to the company’s leaders, this success “is built on a strong technological background, focused on offering first rate product quality, customer service and expedite time to market for new product development."" ""Note, explains Stefano Castelletti, that the range of cosmetic automatic pens and pencils produced by Carefull Colours, currently in high demand for their convenient application and superior performance in the growing segment of lining, require a challenging and specialized technology and they will be certainly an important complement to the portfolio of Oxygen Developments"".

Feelunique.com is scaling up in France,"Premium Beauty News - You became the Director of Feelunique.com in January 2014 to contribute to its development in Europe, and in particular in France. What made you decide to take control of the company? Joël Palix -  Feelunique was created in 2005 in Jersey and counts ten million subscribers today. E-commerce represents 4% of the market in France, 8% in the UK, and 10% in Germany. It is estimated to reach 20% in 2020. Feelunique’s website is one of the pioneers in this sector, and it has a huge potential. Premium Beauty News - What are the advantages of the site? Joël Palix - The diversity of the brands, the service quality, the fact that different segments are represented – makeup, hair care, perfumery –, our international presence in 100 countries in Europe and the rest of the world… We have approximately 500 brands and over 17,000 products referenced, we cover all European countries, but also the United States, China, and Russia, and we even offer free delivery on orders over €15. In addition, customers can get personal help throughout the process, thanks to our beauty questionnaire or their history records. We will also launch our Try Me application before the end of the year, so they can be reassured when making choices. If they order a new product, they can receive a sample to test it, and then keep it or return it if they do not like it. It is important to be able to try the product, especially perfumes. As for their favourite products, our Subscription offer makes it possible to have them sent on a regular basis depending on the frequency of use, without having to order them. We are very keen to make the purchasing act as simple as possible. Premium Beauty News - What does the French website add to the English version? Joël Palix -  The French version has been operational for two years, but right now deliveries are sent from the UK. We are hoping to open a subsidiary in France at the beginning of 2016. For this dedicated version, we have tailored our offering to the market: it does feature French brands, but the very trendy theme of British beauty has also been highlighted, with a selection of 55 So British! niche brands, including Nailsinc, Thisworks, bagsy, Miller Harris, TIGI, Topshop Beauty, Elemis, Sarah Chapman, Cowshed… With a turnover of €100 million expected in 2015, we aim for France to become our second market, after the UK. Premium Beauty News - What is Feelunique.com’s target? Joël Palix -  We target a generation of hyper-connected women under 30. They usually favour online shopping, as it is faster and it corresponds to their own culture. They often know more about products than sales assistants in stores. Beauty is a topic that is widely discussed online. So of course, we are very present on social networks. As a matter of fact, we have just launched – it is an exclusivity – the makeup brand founded by Fleur de Force, a beauty blogger and YouTuber that is extremely popular in the UK, with 4 million views a month."
"""Demand is strong for expert dermo-cosmetic products,"" Sabrina Ethève-Colson, Alpol Cosmétique","Premium Beauty News - Alpol Cosmétique is mostly involved in skincare? Sabrina Ethève-Colson -  Yes, high-quality skincare is our core business, particularly for institutes or in dermo-cosmetics and dermo-aesthetics. We also have a significant expertise in the manufacture of sunscreen products. However, we are diversifying our portfolio with products in between skincare and make-up, in particular tinted suncare products and glosses. Our main expertise remains formulation, with of course particular attention given to ensure regulatory compliance. We can also conduct compatibility and efficiency tests and offer products manufactured in compliance with the most stringent standards. Premium Beauty News - Certification is an important part of your strategy. Sabrina Ethève-Colson -  Our ambition has always been to provide our customers with cosmetics complying with the highest production standards. Since 2011, we have an ISO 22716 certification, which means we are compliant with good cosmetic manufacturing practices, and we recently obtained the ISO 13485 certification that relates to the quality management system for the production of medical devices, and we are also ISO 9001 certified. Alpol Cosmétique aims to provide services in line with requests from institutes and selective distribution but also with the expectations of pharmaceutical companies seeking to diversify their product offering with cosmetic, dermo-cosmetic and dermo-aesthetic lines. Premium Beauty News - Can you give us an example of one of these medical devices? Sabrina Ethève-Colson - We offer for example peelings with a high acid concentration. Products with mainly mechanical properties can also be in high demand in terms of medical devices. These treatments are increasingly popular in pharmacies and drugstores, with products being more and more high tech, often sold on an expert’s medical advice or a pharmacist. Premium Beauty News - Just like institutes, it is a particularly demanding segment in terms of innovation? Sabrina Ethève-Colson - Absolutely! Dermo-cosmetics is a very demanding segment in terms of innovative actives and advanced delivery technologies. Alpol Cosmétique since June 2014 is also the holder of a patent on an encapsulation technique, which enables to release actives, not through friction during the application but through a chemical reaction with the skin. This allows adapting the release time of the active with the product’s function and the customer’s desire. Beyond these issues, like for every cosmetic, textures are also essential. As of September our new website will provide customers with a private access, an overview of our entire catalogue with a search engine for textures. Premium Beauty News - And what about investments? Sabrina Ethève-Colson -  We expanded our logistics area to offer greater flexibility to our customers. Since the beginning of this year we now have almost 4,000 sqm dedicated to this purpose. We also plan to inaugurate a new laboratory early 2016 with a tripled surface area, always with the aim to consolidate our expertise in research, development and formulation. For our customers, we don’t want to stand as a mere subcontractor, we want to be considered a fully fledged partner at the forefront of innovation. New for Fall 2015 At Beyond Beauty Paris 2015, from September 15 to 17, Alpol will showcase its new AGEceutix collection. Composed of 3 complementary products, this new innovative anti-ageing concept is based on a complex of highly efficient active ingredients and acts on all ageing signs for visible, immediate and long-term results.  The range is composed of a filler, a cream and a blur serum."
Cosmax: 60 million dollars invested this year!,"""For skincare and make-up only, explains Jay Kim, CEO of Cosmax International, our turnover, which also rose sharply, will exceed US$ 500 million!"" The group, who, in this area, currently relies on five plants, with one in Korea, two in China, one in Indonesia and one in the USA (Ohio), has announced the intensification of its efforts in the area of packaging development (efforts that resulted in recent months in the creation of a Korea Research and Innovation Centre) with the opening of a similar second unit in the New Jersey premises, operational since January 8, and which should employ a hundred people in three years’ time. ""In this area, we are working with the biggest brands,"" emphasises Jay Kim. Among recent successes developed by the Cosmax teams, a “compact cushion” fully patented by the group and already sold at more than 40 million units to its key customers. And there is more! The group also announced the strengthening of its production tool in China with the launch of two new units in Shanghai. ""As you know the Chinese make-up market is starting to wake up,"" explains Jay Kim. ""Chinese women have started to step up their consumption and it will explode in the coming decade."" Asia, the United States..., but this does not mean the Korean company is disregarding Europe, quite the contrary.... ""We’ve given ourselves two years to stabilize the things we started in the United States and Asia. Then we intend to invest in Europe and why not in France!"""
Italy’s Intercos and Korea’s Hana team up,"A strategic merging for both companies. Everyone visibly ""is a winner"" in the deal. The first, Intercos, by strengthening its base in Asia and more specifically in Korea where the Italian company has recently built a Research and Development centre, the second, Hana, who, through this partnership, will certainly have an opportunity to strengthen its expertise in the packaging and dispensing of cosmetic and skincare formulas and whose investments this year amounted to five million dollars, with the objective to purely and simply double its production capacity. Created in 1993 by Sung Il Kang, a former packaging engineer in charge of development at Amore Pacific, Hana can boast having among its most prestigious clients, the brand La Prairie to which it provides since 2010 particularly sophisticated airless systems. The Korean manufacturer owns some 45 injection machines, several automatic and semi-automatic assembly machines for pumps as well as a coating and metallization line. In terms of developed and marketed products, Hana relies not only on the success of its very sophisticated airless packaging line (70% of its turnover), but also on a series of new products, such as a new pump with an automatic closure that preserves the content; an airless packaging with a customizable dual compartment; another airless packaging with a very clever system for mixing two components upon use; a new lipstick tube with an automatic opening; a new mechanical pencil and, most of all, a new airtight and airless compact equipped with one of the smallest pumps in the world (8.5 mm high) with which the Korean company intends to capture a significant portion of the market for liquid foundations and BB Creams. The Intercos Group, which is the only ODM today with an extensive global manufacturing capacity and experiencing a strong growth in Asia mainly with skincare, achieved in 2014 a turnover of 350 million euros, up by more than 7% compared to the year before. And the 2015 provisional turnover is of 410 million euros (+17%). Only one credo at the Group’s headquarters in Italy, ""constantly innovate but with an aim to be always the fastest and most competitive."" ""Time to market…, time to market!"" has always insisted Dario Ferrari. 525 people out of the 3500 that Intercos employs work on innovation. Nearly 15% of the workforce. The Group has twelve factories and a production capacity of more than 1.4 billion pieces per year! Colour cosmetics remain the bulk of the activity (60%), followed by pencils (28%), skincare (12%), among others. It is on the prestige market that the Italian company makes most of its business (37%), followed by mass (22%), direct sales (14%) and PLs (27%)"
The Alkos Group to develop its sales in North America,"The Alkos Group, one of the main French subcontractors in the cosmetics industry, is determined to focus on export and achieve an international turnover of 35% in 2015 (compared to 15% in 2011). To this aim, the company has strengthened its teams with two new recruits: Éric Goyer as International Business Development Director and, more recently, Viviane Jaillet as Sales Manager for Europe. As the Alkos Group has made North America a priority, it will feature its latest makeup innovations at the MakeUp in New York show, next September 9-19 at the Penn Plaza Pavilion. It is also getting ready for the forthcoming inauguration of a sales office in New York, and has chosen a large stand (26m2) to highlight its whole offering for North American customers. Meanwhile, to meet the growing demand for Made in France products, the Group has recently invested in a new line for plastic pencils and announced a complete line for wood pencils for 2016. “Production tends to be relocated to Europe, which mostly has to do with deadlines and reactivity, and we have noticed a considerable rise in the demand for French-manufactured products from our strategic customers,” explains Florence Lefeuvre, Sales, Marketing and Communication Group Manager. With one purchase every three or four months, mascara is the main product consumed on the makeup market in Europe, and thus represents another growth driver for the Group, which keeps investing in this sector. “The formulas presented at the last Cosmoprof show in Bologna attracted the interest of brands, but their quality also surprised a few brush suppliers,” highlighted Florence Lefeuvre. This success encourages Alkos to broaden its offer in this sector by developing new formulas: Curvissime, a mascara with a curling effect, will be showcased as a preview at MakeUp in New York, and a waterproof mascara is being developed for the 2016 edition of the Cosmoprof show. Here are a few of the new launches to be presented in New York: – Eyeliner Liquid Like: this pencil offers matchless intensity from the first application. It glides on flawlessly, provides optimized drying in no time, and lasts longer thanks to a new raw material. – Gel Sensation Lip Liner: this long-wear gel lip pencil provides a “liquid like” sensation on the lips, and again, glides on flawlessly and lasts longer, more than 15 hours! – Color Shine BB Lipbalm: this all-in-one, super comfortable, shiny stick formula is both a balm and a lipstick. Enriched with oils and endowed with a high SPF, it leaves the lips well-hydrated and protected. – Oil Infusion: an ultra-light, non-sticky, non-oily moisturizing oil that will coat lips with a different colour, depending on their pH! – Kiss Proof Aqua Lipstain: a fluid, highly-covering formula with a matte tattoo effect, but which only leaves an almost imperceptible, no-transfer film on the lips. – Studio Lipstick Jumbo Pencil & Jumbo Twist: a highly-pigmented formula conditioned as a waterproof pencil or with a Jumbo Twist mechanism, which delivers a no-transfer, velvet-matte colour only with a very small quantity of product on the lips, for ultimate comfort. – Sweet Lipstick Scrub: a lip scrub in the form of a stick, formulated with sugar, grapes pips, and crushed apricot kernels. – Beauty Secret Correcting Cream: a transparent foundation that evens and corrects the complexion without any stain effect. An original, innovative, unique formulation solution for all complexions, with no equivalent on the market. The Alkos Group will also take part in the Cosmetic 360 show organized by the Cosmetic Valley, whose first edition will be held at the Carrousel du Louvre, in Paris, on October 15 and 16, 2015. The French supplier is preparing several skincare and hygiene innovations for this event, in particular via its Sagal subsidiary specialized in the production of high-end perfumed soaps and sticks."
Cosmopolitan makes niche perfumery penetrate the Brazilian market,"Premium Beauty News - How did you get the idea to import niche perfumery brands into Brazil? Cristiane Vilar - Apart from Annick Goutal, Creed, or Bond No.9, Brazilians do not really have access to niche perfumery brands, simply because there are not any here. However, some of them did get to know them when travelling to France or abroad. So, as an importer, I decided to introduce the concept of niche perfumery in Brazil: no brand could ever have made it on its own. I worked in collaboration with a French-based partner, Claude Requena. We started by selecting various brands, and then we took the time to have them registered by ANVISA. It is pretty hard to be a pioneer in Brazil: it took us three years to get through the whole process, but we finally got to open our showroom with eight registered brands, Ann Gérard Parfums Paris, Mark Buxton Perfumes, Frapin & Cie, Comptoir Sud Pacific, E. Coudray, M. Micallef, Teo Cabanel, and Au Pays de la Fleur d’Oranger. Other brands will be showcased before the end of the year: Molinard, Arty Fragrance by Élisabeth de Feydeau, Paul Émilien, Rouge Bunny Rouge, and Les Parfums de Rosine. Premium Beauty News - What is the purpose of this 150m2 area, is it both a showroom and a store? Cristiane Vilar -   The idea is not just to introduce new perfumes, but rather to make as many people possible find out about this concept and provide a different shopping experience. We make our customers embark on an olfactory journey to the south of France, Paris, and oriental countries, or on a historical trip with brands like Frapin, Teo Cabanel, and E. Coudray. France is at the core of the journey, as it is always been dear to the hearts of Brazilians, and it is where perfumery was born. We offer our customers an opportunity to discover and buy rare perfumes featured on an exclusive basis in Brazil, while immersing themselves in other worlds. Premium Beauty News - Have you considered extending the concept? Cristiane Vilar -  We have, yes, although they are only projects for now. We have contacted other companies to reproduce the concept in São Paulo, Rio, and in the Nordeste. The e-shop is also being finalized. Other than niche perfumes, it will feature men’s skincare products by British brand Gentlemen’s Tonic, and Alorée organic cosmetics as well, later on. Premium Beauty News -  Did your customers react positively to these rare perfumes? Cristiane Vilar -  Very positively. Whatever their social class, Brazilians have always loved perfumes. They are also quite keen on the olfactory journey concept, which makes it possible to penetrate different worlds. Our customers are rather wealthy, but they are also curious and very open to novelty. There was a high demand for rarity and newness. Brazilians are willing to discover other scents than citruses, which are common here. They enjoy woody, oriental, and even Oud-based fragrances. Nevertheless, the public still needs to be educated about high perfumery. And that is the reason why I am working on organizing visits for creators in Brazil. I want them to be able to introduce their own brands. The first one, Ann Gérard, spent a few days in Brasília in August to see our showroom, present her collection to both the public and the press, and tell them about her own story and career. We are passionate about beautiful perfumes, so we have been investing our energy into promoting them in Brazil. There are still great things to achieve."
Graine de Pastel to open over 30 franchised stores within the next three years,"The opening of its first store in 2012 in Toulouse, France, was a real turning point for the brand created in 2003 by Nathalie Juin and Carole Garcia. Others quickly followed, both in the South East and the capital: Carcassonne in 2013, the central Marais quarter in Paris in 2014, Albi in 2015, and Paris again the same year, Rue du Dragon, near Saint Germain des Prés. And this September, the brand will inaugurate a 270 m2 spa in a new palace in Toulouse, M Gallery: La cour des Consuls. From the very beginning, the two creators had had in mind to revive a traditional ingredient: pastel oil, which is derived from the seeds and plants of the same name. “It is a patrimonial plant from the region of Toulouse. Its leaves were traditionally used to make the famous blue pigment, but its oil has been renowned for its medicinal properties since the Ancient times,” Carole Garcia explains. In order to secure its supply, the company established partnerships with farmers. Approximately 10 hectares will be cultivated in 2016, mainly via integrated farming, but also organic farming. Building on this success, Graine de Pastel is now about to take a new step forward in its development. Its ranges are being redesigned under the supervision of Marketing Director Leïla Veillon, with new packaging to reinforce the character of each line, while sticking to the visual coherence of the brand. But above all, as its concept is now well-established, the brand is banking on franchised stores, with two openings planned for this autumn, in Versailles and Saint-Germain-en-Laye, near Paris. The idea is to open about ten stores in 2016, and do the same in 2017 and 2018. Graine de Pastel also seeks to strongly develop its global sales and aims for 50% of export sales in 2018, compared to 15% right now. The company’s products are currently available in Japan, China, Taiwan, and Korea. Several markets are opening up – Australia, the Middle East, the United States, Canada – and in Europe, the brand hopes to be able to rely on master franchise agreements. With its signature ingredient cultivated locally, and a purchasing policy that favours local sourcing from the Midi-Pyrénées region, Graine de Pastel stands out as an iconic brand in a new cosmetic region. It now endeavours to shift towards a more technical positioning, in addition to its patrimonial image: the brand has strengthened its R&D and is working on integrating new ingredients in its formulas. Skincare treatments have been developed for the stores located in Toulouse and Rue du Dragon, in Paris, which have booths available, and with a view to increase sales in spas. “We pay particular attention to galenics. On the whole, we did not launch so many products in twelve years. And most important of all, we did not kill any,” Carole Garcia explains. This method has actually proven more than efficient for this young brand, as it is about to play in the big league."
L’Occitane: a pivotal year,"Premium Beauty News - Quite an extraordinary story! Reinold Geiger -  You are right! It is amazing! But it is only the result of a great work in common of the 8,000 Group employees and of a distribution network of nearly 3,000 stores across 90 countries. Just like all great stories, it begins with a meeting, that of Olivier Baussan. This meeting took place in 1992. A few decades earlier, Olivier, a 23 years old literature student, was busy distilling essential oils from Provence plants: rosemary, cade, lavender and olives. At the time he used to sell his creations on local markets. In 1976, he partnered with the chemist Yves Millou to create the brand ""L’Occitane"". In 1977, ""Le Relais Occitane"" the first store of the brand opened in Manosque in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence department. In 1981 the first ""L’Occitane"" factory opened in Provence in the town of Volx. Then in 1992 the first Paris store was inaugurated. The same year, the company opened its capital. I first invested in 1994 and then in 1996 in this company who as you may recall was on the verge of bankruptcy. In 1996 and 1997, we opened our first stores in New York, Hong Kong and Tokyo and started to develop the distribution network in France and abroad. Premium Beauty News - What makes L’Occitane so unique from the start? Reinold Geiger -  One of the strengths of the brands owned by the Group is their dedication to creating effective cosmetic formulas from naturally derived ingredients. Year after year, the R&D teams share this ambition, while also ensuring that they respect the values of the brand. From the sourcing of botanical ingredients to the extraction and characterization of active molecules and effectiveness tests on the skin, the R&D teams of the Group work together in perfect synergy to offer the very best of plants, and to guarantee optimal quality and traceability (from the harvesting site to the finished product). Pioneers in natural beauty care, our laboratories launched a cosmetogenomics programme in 2009, to demonstrate and validate the effectiveness of active ingredients at the heart of cells. With an innovative development department that is able to create over 400 innovative formulas per year, we are renowned for our skincare expertise. Our team consisting of more than 100 researchers specialized in 20 different scientific disciplines, works on the development of new formulas. Patents for these formulas, demonstrating the effectiveness of the natural active ingredients, are regularly filed. Premium Beauty News - Innovation is at the heart of your strategy... Reinold Geiger - Thus, every year, almost 20 million euros are dedicated to our innovation centre that covers more than 2,500 m2. In recent years our investment in research and development increased at twice the rate of the Group’s turnover, thus demonstrating our commitment to research and innovation. The centre is home to ten laboratories: molecular and cellular biology, analytical chemistry, plant extraction, microbiology, sensorial analysis, clinical evaluation, and three formulation laboratories (prospective, skincare and personal care). Across the Group, we have invested industrially speaking more than 120 million euros in the past two years. Premium Beauty News - This year’s results are particularly good! Reinold Geiger -  We are delighted to report a remarkable growth for the year, backed by our continuous commitment to a balanced focus on revenue growth and investments. We will continue to pursue our corporate strategy of achieving sustainable growth with greater efficiency. L’Occitane’s evolving culture and innovative capability allows us to remain adaptive and attractive in the ever-changing global consumer markets. Looking ahead, the global macro-economic outlook may remain challenging, particularly with currency volatility. In order to further enhance the core L’Occitane brand awareness in global markets amidst the uncertain and ever-changing retail environment, we plan to implement a marketing program in the new financial year. We believe that a focused and disciplined approach to build the company for the future, together with the policy to reward management on a basis which is aligned to sustainable long term performance, will drive growth and deliver lasting value in the interest of the shareholders."
LF Beauty presents its new organization,"Premium Beauty News - Can you please first tell me a little bit about Li & Fung? Gerard Raymond - Certainly, Li & Fung is a world leader in the design, development, sourcing and logistics of consumer goods for leading brands and retailers worldwide. Founded in 1906 in southern China, today we are headquartered in Hong Kong and have more than 300 locations in over 40 different markets. Our network includes  more than 26,000 employees and 15,000 suppliers around the world. Our customer relationships, supplier network and operations are unrivalled; we are proud to be the supply chain partner-of-choice for brands and retailers worldwide. Our product range includes fashion apparel, children’s wear, sportswear, outerwear, handbags and accessories, footwear, beauty, home furniture and décor, home textiles, seasonal products and gifts. Our customer base includes a diverse range of brands and retailers including national brands, specialty stores, department stores, e-commerce, clubs, hypermarkets and off-price retailers. Premium Beauty News - Quite impressive, indeed! What is actually the weight of LF Beauty in the company? Gerard Raymond - LF Beauty is a global team with more than 3,000 people in locations around the world. We are formulators and suppliers of packaging, applicators and accessories, and we also have an expertise in filling and point of sale (POS) solutions. We are gradually moving into a leading position in the field of digital technology. We have factories in the United States, United Kingdom, China, Indonesia and Thailand, all which are supported by R&D labs in the UK, China and Thailand. Premium Beauty News - How is this new organization articulated? Gerard Raymond - The needs of our customers are clear: they demand continuous innovation, and they need a global response to their requirements. To us this means that customers are looking at ways to differentiate their position and add value to their offerings, they are therefore looking for a partner capable of providing this global response in a timely manner (speed to market is very important) and they expect the highest level of quality. Our new organization takes into account all of these requirements. We are fortunate to operate on different continents, and as I said earlier, this allows us to offer a response capacity in terms of formulations, packaging, applicators, accessories and even POS tools, not forgetting our ever-increasing expertise in the field of connected beauty (select visitors were given a chance to see the concrete applications at the last MakeUp in Seoul and MakeUp in Paris BtoB shows). Premium Beauty News - You boast being capable to offer solutions across the entire ""Beauty"" spectrum! Gerard Raymond - We don’t boast, we prefer to highlight that we have solutions in the area of perfume, skin care, hair care, oral care, make-up and so on. We cover all of the beauty product categories and to illustrate this we have recently made investments in both formulations as well as manufacturing capabilities for facial masks, one of the fastest growing categories in skin care, these capabilities will come on stream in Quarter 4 of this year. Premium Beauty News - Your partnership arrangement with Korean company Cosmecca also proves your desire to work with top players in the sectors you are targeting! Gerard Raymond - I’m sure that you are aware of the fact that South Korean companies have become the benchmark for innovative skincare products in Asia. We want to give our customers the possibility to access the best of South Korea’s formulation and manufacturing sector. Cosmecca is one of the leading beauty suppliers in the country, so it was only natural for us to collaborate with them. Under the terms of the agreement, which was announced in March, we will be able to build on the combined strength of our R&D teams and production capacity in South Korea, China, Thailand, the UK and Indonesia. The two companies will also pool their marketing resources behind new products and existing ranges and maximize the business opportunities among Li & Fung’s customers in Europe and the United States. Premium Beauty News - Another topic on which your company is consistently working is that of the development of all the tools enabling you to take a leading position in the field of connected beauty! Gerard Raymond - We see it as the biggest challenge for the beauty industry in the coming years. In the future, with artificial intelligence, it will be possible to go even further and correct our image in real time. As our team demonstrated at MakeUp in Paris in June, it will be possible to integrate a voice speaking application to our tools to listen to both beauty tips and health tips. Bathroom mirrors will conduct diagnosis along with comparisons over time. We will be able to virtually try our wardrobe and our accessories and share our experiments on social media. We will have our 3D holographic clone. While some applications are still some way off, others are just around the corner. We have already designed projects implementing digital related technologies for a number of leading brands. Technology is the first step and we can use it to attract customers’ attention, however, what really should come first is to have consumers cooperate with brands, to get them to play, surprise them and most of all, to thoroughly test it before launching a technological solution. Interfaces must be intuitive and quickly capture attention to trigger a purchase. Let me share a specific case study with you. Last year we developed an interactive application in the form of a game for the launch of Estée Lauder’s new fragrance MYNY by DKNY. For three weeks, interactive displays with motion detectors were installed at Debenhams on Oxford Street. So when someone walked by the store, the interactive screen would invite them to follow the perfume bottle on the digital display. Picture captures of the passers-by were then given inside the store where they could then share them via social media. It was a really engaging and fun consumer experience."
Keystone completes acquisition of French company Centre 7,"Polychromatic, the nail polish division of the Keystone Industries portfolio of companies, and one of the founders of the gel polish technology, announced they have acquired French company Centre 7 (C7).  “Centre 7 has a distinguished reputation in the masstige and luxury cosmetic market,” highlights Keystone.  When complete, this acquisition will signify pivotal expansion into the global beauty arena for Keystone Industries. “We’re expecting the acquisition of Centre 7 to strengthen the opportunities in the beauty industry not only in the United States market, but also throughout Europe,” said Cary Robinson, President of Keystone.  ""It’s a well-respected company that manufactures products of distinction."" Centre 7, located near Paris, in the Cosmetic Valley, has been in business for more than 20 years in the beauty and personal care industry. Centre 7 specializes in the filling and packaging of nail polish and other luxury cosmetic products.  “The dedicated team at Centre 7 is known for their high levels of quality control and customer service, vital characteristics which are the building blocks of Polychromatic’s overall mission,” says Keystone. With anticipated capacity of filling close to 30 million bottles annually, Keystone intends to grow Centre 7 as an ideal vendor for both bulk and packaged cosmetics. There are immediate plans to expand the facility for the full-scale production of nail polish. The acquisition will also give Polychromatic the “Made in France” quality advantage, and a closer proximity to larger French and European customers. According to Keystone, the Centre 7 plant has been audited by major cosmetic brands, and is rated to use flammable products, something that is difficult to obtain in Europe. The integration of Centre 7 allows Keystone’s existing entities — Keystone Research & Pharmaceutical and Polychromatic – to leverage on a platform to showcase its R&D, technologies and services."
"""Our ambition is to double our sales by 2020,"" Julien Saada, Maesa","Premium Beauty News - Exclusive brands now account for nearly 50% of your activity. Is it a change of direction for Maesa? Julien Saada -  It is indeed a strategic course for us, but it is also the natural extension of our private labelling activity. When a retailer decides to launch his own brand, he may feel the need to create a brand which is different from his own retail brand. This is the case with Monoprix in France and the brand Elle, of DM in Germany with P2 Cosmetics or of Walgreens in the United States with Circa Color Cosmetics. The difference between pure private labelling and creating an exclusive brand is that in the second case the brand belongs to us, which means we are the ones who invest in marketing and communication. It’s a whole new business model but it does not change our customer model. Each brand has its own unique and exclusive customer. Being able to offer exclusive brands simply enabled us to gain new customers. We are now managing seven exclusive brands and working towards their development. The Elle brand for example, will be launched at Sephora Spain, and we will launch early 2016, at Ulta in the United States, a very professional make-up brand bearing the name of a make-up artist. The other consequence of the rise of exclusive brands in our activity is the growing share of the make-up category, which now represents 45% of our turnover, that is, as much as perfume. The remaining 10% consisting of the bath & body care and home fragrance category. Premium Beauty News - Now that you have this brand management experience, are you not tempted to extend the adventure with a classic brand that you would propose to different retailers? Julien Saada - No, we do not want to have a brand among others to offer our retailers, it isn’t our line of business. We strongly believe in a differentiated offer and our mission is to bring exclusivity to our clients, with products that can only be found in their stores. Premium Beauty News - What are your growth prospects?  Julien Saada - In 2014 our growth reached 18%, with sharp rises in Europe (Elle, Habitat) and the Middle East, particularly in Dubai with Landmark, a retailer specialized in fashion, where our brand Elle is distributed and with the Kamal Osman Jamjoom Group, specialized in lingerie and beauty with the Nayomi and Mikyajy branded stores. For 2015, our growth will benefit from the acquisition of P2 Cosmetics and we aim by 2020 to increase almost twofold our turnover, that is, an average 15% growth per year. If we first focused our development on Europe and North America, we now plan to take a closer look into Asian markets, especially China. Premium Beauty News - What are the circuits that will best support this ambition? Julien Saada - For us, the most dynamic circuit is undoubtedly the one of drugstores, followed by supermarkets. This is where volumes are the highest. But we also work a lot with textile brands. Premium Beauty News - And exclusive brands will be the main drivers of this growth? Julien Saada -  Not exclusively. We expect a balanced growth of our three business segments. Alongside exclusive brands, the private labelling activity represents about 27% of the Group’s turnover. It is our historical activity and we have acquired in this sector a know-how, recognized by our customers. We can not only develop products, but also propose the appropriate merchandising and advice to our customers, including for the composition of their ranges. We are also aiming to double our turnover in this sector by 2020. The outsourcing activity, our third segment, is focused on beauty brands. We work with brands that entrust us with the development and production of lines that they do not have the time or inclination to develop internally. This allows them to diversify their activities, at an attractive cost. We will, for example, launch the bath & body line of the brand Artdeco. Premium Beauty News - Given this important growth, do you plan to equip yourself with your own production tools? Julien Saada - Since our inception we have made the choice of being a fabless company. No investment of this type is planned.   Given the diversity of our productions we prefer working with a range of very reliable partners on several continents and with whom we have built a long term relationship."
"Au Pays de la Fleur d’Oranger, a brand from the land of high perfumery","Au Pays de la Fleur d’Oranger is meant to be atypical and stand out from the usual codes of luxury perfumery. The name is quite long and can make it pretty hard to export the brand, but Virginie claims it as a real identity. She uses white, partly opaque Saverglass bottles to disentangle the visual from the olfactory and thus avoid trying to influence choices to let the nose express itself. “I like going against the norm,” confides Virginie Roux. A flagship raw material, Néroli Blanc or bitter orange tree flower, supports a trilogy of various accords: Neroli Blanc L’Eau de parfum contains accords of Neroli, lemon tree petitgrain, bergamot orange, rose jasmine, and benzoin; Néroli Blanc Intense is stronger, with verbena, bergamot orange, rose jasmine, and cedar accords; Néroli Blanc L’Eau de Cologne is fresher with its accords of grapefruit, bergamot orange, rose, and tea. The new Eau de parfum Néroli Oud completes the collection with a more powerful juice. “The original, unique note that mixes Neroli and Oud reveals certain aspects of the Oud note that perfectly suit our Western markets. It is a real astonishing, explosive blend,” Jean-Claude Gigodot explains. The second creation, Eau de Madeleine, celebrates the memory of women that left a mark on our lives with a more powerful scent, where the very high concentration in Encens prevails. The opaque, black bottle surmounted by a wooden cover designed by Pujolasos is decorated with a vintage tin application. Eau de Madeleine introduces the Liberté collection dedicated to free women profiles, which will count four fragrances. With its sophisticated compositions made with natural materials rather than too many synthetic ones, the Au Pays de la Fleur d’Oranger range will delight a well-informed public. The brand is present on the global level, mainly in Europe and the Middle-East, and is available in Paris at Sens Unique."
"“The cosmetics market is changing completely,” Loïc Armand, Cosmetics Europe","Premium Beauty News - You have announced a slight growth of the cosmetics market in Europe for this year. What are the prospects for the European industry? Loïc Armand - We are extremely positive about the prospects for our industry! We can now say the crisis is over in Europe. The market showed a growth rate of +0.5% in 2014, compared to the -1.4% decline we experienced in 2013. Some countries are still suffering and remain in recession, but on the whole, the European market is picking up again, and even in the countries where this upturn was slower, it is getting better. The cosmetics industry in Europe represents 4,500 companies, including over 4,000 SMEs, and 1.5 million direct jobs, including 25,000 scientific jobs (+5.3% since 2004). The other reason why we are optimistic is that we have been performing well on global markets. The European industry is the largest cosmetics exporter in the world. In the next 15 years, 1.5 billion people in the world will become part of the middle class. This is an extraordinary opportunity for our industry, which is taking action to participate in satisfying the needs of these new consumers. Premium Beauty News - What actions are actually taken? Loïc Armand - First, we have decided to focus on research and innovation. We are foreseeing a real change of paradigm, in particular with a revolution in the customer relationship, and also many environmental challenges. The digital revolution and social networks are transforming both distribution networks and the relationship between consumers and brands. Supply is getting more and more personalized, and brands have entered into a closer dialogue with consumers. Cosmetics are all the more sensitive to this phenomenon since they bear a strong intimate dimension. It is not trivial to apply a product on one’s skin. Premium Beauty News - What about the environment? Loïc Armand -  The cosmetics industry is perfectly aware of the challenges related to the increasing demand on the global level. As a collective, the European industry has volunteered for the Product Environmental Footprint project managed by the European Commission to develop a harmonized method for calculating the environmental footprint. For technical reasons, our project on rinse-off products has not been selected among the Commission’s pilot projects, but we have worked on it on a voluntary basis and we are hoping to get applicable results in 2016. Beyond the projects supervised byCosmetics Europe on behalf of the whole industry, companies strongly commit to ambitious projects designed to reduce their environmental impact on an individual basis. For example, L’Oréal has undertaken to reduce its CO2 emissions by 60% in absolute value by 2020. Other companies like Unilever and many of our members have defined their own objectives. Premium Beauty News - Regulatory harmonization is also one of Cosmetics Europe’s main objectives. Loïc Armand -  I would rather talk about convergence. The cosmetics industry has had this objective in mind for a very long time, and it makes perfect sense with the ongoing development of global markets and e-commerce. Online sales might actually reduce the States’ ability to control their own markets. Convergence is an important challenge for the European industry, as it is a major exporter. We consider the European regulatory model as one of the best in terms of consumer and environmental protection. It is based on scientific risk assessment, and it is according to this principle that we have been promoting it around the world. In practice, we are one the safest industries in the world, and we think we deserve to be trusted by regulators. Premium Beauty News - Could you give us an update on the negotiations regarding the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) in the field of cosmetics? Loïc Armand -  The TTIP represented a unique opportunity to solve significant regulatory divergences between Europe and the United States, in particular the definition of cosmetics, which differs a lot on each side of the Atlantic. We have to admit there is no political will to put the most important diverging elements on the negotiating table. Cosmetics Europe has worked with its American counterpart, the Personal Care Products Council, on a list of divergences we intended to solve. The list was forwarded to the authorities in charge of the negotiations, but obviously, they did not wish to go that far. However, if Europe and the United States had agreed on a regulatory model, their influence would have been considerable throughout the world. We have not completely given up moving in this direction, but right now, the TTIP negotiations are focused on more technical issues like the mutual recognition of the lists of UV-filters recognized as both safe and efficient, or the mutual recognition of the alternatives to tests on animals validated by the OECD. That being said, we are convinced the next transformations in the cosmetics market, in particular the rise of online sales, will encourage this convergence."
Natura cultivates its naturalness,"Premium Beauty News - 1.3 million advisors represent and sell Natura products in Brazil. As this force has made the brand successful in an increasingly competitive, retail-driven environment, how can you make it change? Marcelo Bicalho Behar - Natura has developed around the customer relationship: direct selling guarantees trust, which is a key element, here in this country. These women and men represent one of the founding pillars of the group. They have actually come to form a social network, in the original meaning of the word, and we have been mixing it with online networks for a year. We have transposed the advisor-customer relationship on the Internet, which makes access to our products easier, while preserving the link between our consulting trademark and a real relationship. This mix works perfectly well and the advisors concerned have already got better results. Our pool of advisors is being renewed with many young people, who see this job as an interesting way to pay for their studies. They are very knowledgeable about what the Internet has to offer. Premium Beauty News - Are there other ways for tourists visiting Brazil to have access to Natura products? Marcelo Bicalho Behar -  Today, tourists can buy our products through our consultants in Brazil or on our portal rede.natura.net. In addition, we are considering increasing our presence in airports and launching an amenities project in hotels. Premium Beauty News - What about the global markets less used to direct selling? Marcelo Bicalho Behar - By purchasing Aesop, Natura has banked on a brand that shares the same values and helps it monitor the retail model in many countries. Besides, we are still working on experimental operations on mature markets like France, where our marketing strategy on ingredients from Amazonia is very well-perceived. European consumers are very sensitive to products’ sustainability. Premium Beauty News - Is sustainability not a strong argument in Brazil? Marcelo Bicalho Behar - We are the first Brazilian company to have developed eco-responsible products for Brazilian consumers. Our commitment to preserving Amazonia has become natural, it just goes without saying. Over 15 years, 15 million Brazilians have moved out of poverty: they have gained access to “non-essential” products, and as a middle class they have become demanding in all respects. Therefore we need to offer them both innovative and sustainable products, and to this aim we dedicate 3% of our turnover to these requirements. Premium Beauty News - How do you organize responsible innovation at Natura? Alessandro Mendes - We have set up a very strict innovation process over the last 12 years to control carbon emissions at each phase of development, for each new product. We launch 150 new products every year. Our rule is that a new product’s environmental impact must be lower than that of the product it is meant to replace, and if it is not, a committee decides whether it can still be launched or should be reviewed. We aim to keep improving quality, while reducing the environmental impact. We have replaced all mineral oils by vegetal oils, and 88% of our formulas are plant-based. Premium Beauty News - Your flagship ingredients are derived from the Amazonian biomass. How can you exploit it while still preserving it? Alessandro Mendes -  We remain close to local populations. We show them the forest is a valuable source in the long term, and it is more profitable to protect it if we want to obtain a regular income from it, rather than clearing parcels to sell wood. As for ingredient sourcing, we draw inspiration both from their very instructive practices and traditional research. Natura guarantees efficient traceability by selecting the harvesting methods and periods with the communities, and then our partners – Symrise, Croda, or BASF – take over. Premium Beauty News - Which segments are you focusing on for your next developments? Alessandro Mendes - We intend to establish ourselves even more firmly as leaders on skincare products adapted to Brazilian skin types, as this segment has a strong potential, like makeup."
GEKA Group set for growth with the acquisition of OEKA,"GEKA, one of the world’s leading manufacturers of brushes, applicators and complete packaging systems for the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries, is the new owner of OEKA, an internationally active manufacturer of plastic and metal components. The merger will strengthen the global market position of the two regional companies from Franconia. “Our aim is to create a globally operating German champion specialized in the development and production of applicators and complete packaging systems for the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries,” said Nikolaus Michelsen, managing director of GEKA. “At the same time, we are eager to retain going forward OEKA’s tight-knit corporate culture with its rich tradition rooted in Franconia.” OEKA, which has a history that stretches back more than 100 years, is specializing in deep drawing of metal, plastic injection molding, surface finishing and assembly technology. OEKA’s product range also extends to the development and manufacture of hybrid parts, such as innovative brushes and applicators for cosmetic and medical applications. “I am especially pleased that GEKA is going to retain the approximately 220 employees and is even planning to make new hires,” said insolvency administrator Joachim Exner, partner at the law office Dr. Beck & Partners, after the purchase agreement was signed yesterday evening.  The transition is scheduled for mid-July 2015, and the creditors have already consented to the sale, the amount of which has not been disclosed. “For us, OEKA is the perfect partner to help implement our plans for global growth and expand our value-added chain,” said Amaury de Menthière, managing director of GEKA. “Above all, we will be relying on the experience of OEKA’s highly qualified employees and the production capacities of the Bamberg location. With regards to the planned growth, we intend to invest millions into the site to upgrade its technology.” GEKA also anticipates that merging the two companies and the use of a single brand will generate synergies with regard to the cost of materials. More specifically, GEKA plans to integrate the OEKA BEAUTY and OEKA MED divisions into the GEKA Beauty and GEKA Healthcare divisions. However, the OEKA Tech division will be assigned to the recently founded GEKA company ‘OEKA Tech Automotive GmbH’. It is also planned to give the OEKA executives some greater additional responsibilities within the GEKA Group."
Ancorotti Cosmetics: exponential growth,"The new registered office and head office alone employs 130 people, distributed in brand new premises, the interior design of which evokes the intense creativity of its founders, especially Enrica Ancorotti. Twenty million euros in turnover in 2013, thirty million last year and nearly 40 million expected this year, including 5 million in skincare, the Ancorotti saga is a very good example of this - family owned - Italian industry where the catchword is clearly ""here we work!"" Because such progress and such results owe obviously nothing to chance. And as everyone knows, the example comes from above… Not a day, not a week, not a month passes without Renato Ancorotti and his daughter Enrica, not taking front stage, one of them travelling around the world, constantly in touch with customers, and the other studying new formula for a new development.  ""And that’s not all,  explains Enrica, we also have to manage the production and logistics of a business employing about 125 people today. To better cope with growth and the new organization we decided to recruit Marco Mazzola as our General Managing Director. He has been in cosmetics for 30 years."" The gone through road for Ancorotti Cosmetics - almost - operating in all segments, from make-up to skincare, is impressive! With regard to its industrial capacity, managers have pulled out all the stops in past months. ""Thanks to this, explain officials, we are only using 73% of our total capacity, which makes us extremely flexible to deal with unexpected new orders."" To note that the Italian firm probably has one of the most impressive pool of back injection machines in the area, with a total of 13 units capable of producing some 63,000 pieces per shift and per day! The filling capacity for mascaras is not bad either with 185,000 pieces per shift and per day!  This did not prevent the company from also investing heavily in compaction machines and quality control equipment for powders. ""Our full service activity has not stopped growing in recent months,"" says Renato Ancorotti. ""So much so that this year it will account for 55% of our business!"" Reflecting other Italian companies in the sector, its export activity is continuing to grow, now representing more than 80% of its turnover. The most recent development being the opening in January of a subsidiary in New York. A momentum that is certainly not ready to end. The company announced the development and production of a new product in a ""new"" building by the end of the year. As for its presence at MakeUp in Paris, it will be marked by the presentation of a new collection where make-up becomes art in all its forms, with innovative products that allow a woman to use her beauty as a perfect canvas on which she can draw, paint, sculpt and refine her facial features."
Brazil: Fareva develops its own exclusive skincare collections,"Due to its climate, different skin types and consumption patterns, Brazil has its own requirements when it comes to cosmetics. Thanks to its satellite laboratory dedicated to sourcing and customer knowledge, Fareva now lies at the heart of the Brazilian market and develops two body and face skincare collections every year. This approach is new for the group, and is enriched with the experience of its newly integrated makeup division, Chromavis, which offers customers innovative textures and formulas several times a year. After Amazonia, Hemisphere Advantage, the collection launched in late 2014, was meant to be surprising: whitening intimate hygiene product, gasless deodorant, anti-aging shampoo, hair gel with an SPF, anti-cellulite aerosol, revitalizing eye contour roll-on, SPF 99 or anti-dark spot sun products with a dry feel, Wake up cream with a light texture… This really original range comprises 16 references with extracts from Latin America, and also two fragrances for Men and Women. Launched in May 2015 with 15 products to be available by the end of the year, the new collection, Mystical Treatments, targets city dwellers seeking escape and puts an emphasis on sun care, a booming segment in Brazil. It already comprises a skincare shower gel, zen and youth mists, a mummy and baby family moisturizer, an after-sun refreshing foam, a post-sunburn mask, and an anti-aging night mask. “We aim to offer Brazilian players a different concept for cosmetic products. Our collections in Brazil are developed with this spirit, but they can be produced in any country,” Thibaut Fraisse explains. This is a winning strategy for the group, which expects to double its number of local customers as it has now by the end of the year."
Omnicos: 17 years already!,"The gone through road is impressive for this Italian SME specialized in the creation and production of cosmetic formulations intended for the make-up industry! ""There is no secret recipe,"" explains Manuela Guerrini, the Sales Director, ""to insure one’s development and presence today in this make-up niche, we must innovate, innovate and innovate!  In 2010, we created our own R&D laboratory."" As a proof, this new ""fluffy concept"" recently developed and whose main characteristic is the sensoriality and the three-dimensionality of the product. Another proof, our 24h long lasting automatic pencils. Not to mention this new tablet tint concept: colour tablets to be mixed with a face primer to create different colours suited to each skin. A whole series of novelties that will be presented at MakeUp in Paris in a few days. ""In fact, insists Mr. Cicchetti, the company’s CEO, we actually invest between 8% and 10% of our turnover each year in this innovation policy."" The company can also boast achieving 85% of its turnover from export sales with, as priority markets, for the time being, France and Germany. ""But we have set foot on the US market last year,"" emphasises Manuela Guerrini. Another strong point of Omnicos, and not the least, its ability to create its own filling and automated machines through its partnership with the company Automation IDM, located near Milan. ""This gives us obviously quite a lot of flexibility"", explain officials at Romanengo."
Sensai to launch first fragrance ever,"Launched in 1983, four years after the first steps of Kanebo in Europe, the Sensai brand is the international flagship of the Japanese cosmetics giant. The brand is currently available in 4400 doors in 43 countries, mainly in Europe (34 countries) but also in the Middle East (8 countries) and South Africa. The main markets being Germany and Italy. “We want to transform Sensai into an independent global luxury brand, with both functional and emotional features, with a strong and consistent identity, in order to compete with French and European rivals,” says Yuji Naito, who has been responsible for revamping the brand since 2012. Mr Naito thus decided that all Sensai products would be reformulated with Koishimaru silk, the prestigious ingredient that originally contributed to Kanebo’s success in Japan.  Into cosmetic products, this silk, an exceptional fibre once reserved for the imperial family, has exceptional moisturizing properties and can stimulate the production of hyaluronic acid.  As a second step, the design Simultaneously, the brand entrusted Gwenaël Nicolas, a French designer based in Tokyo and founder of the agency Curiosity, to fully rethink the products packaging drawing on the brand’s roots and DNA.  Thus were born in 2012 the new packaging inspired from silk cocoons. In 2013, the brands transformation culminates with the launch of the Ultimate Cellular Performance range, and in January 2014, Sensai Cosmetics Inc. is created to succeed Kanebo International. “Sensai is one of the five key brands of Kanebo. It must become a major player in the ‘super prestige’ segment and is poised to become Kanebo’s first true international brand by expanding from Europe to Asia,” adds Yuji Naito. The brand will therefore carry on to strengthen its ultra-premium offer by completing its Ultimate range and continue to differentiate from its competitors through its Japanese origins in particular by communicating on its “skincare saho” method, derived from the Japanese tradition of hospitality and service. In September 2015, Sensai will launch its very first fragrance, based on the collaboration between Mary Salamagne, perfumer at Firmenich, and designer Gwenael Nicolas. Named “The Silk” (of course!) the fragrance will be available in two 50 ml versions: Eau de Parfum and Eau de Toilette. “The fragrance will contribute to build the Sensai universe and reinforce the emotional side of the brand,” concludes Yuji Naito. Entry into new markets will come next, with Asia as a priority."
Granado’s made in Brazil cosmetics are on a roll,"When Nazish Munchenbach took over the marketing department in 2004, Granado was moribund and under bankruptcy threat. But as she was both convinced of the brand’s potential and moved by the affection Brazilians of all generations felt for it, she started by rebuilding its image with the support of Christopher Freeman. She got some help from a designer friend based in New York City, Jérôme Berard, and from Sissi, Christopher’s daughter, and drew from the brand’s precious archives to recover its original DNA. A team of eight people worked on updating the visual identity, which was to become a key element of this rejuvenation. The image was restored with colours and drawings from the old days, and attracted a new generation fond of the vintage trend. Meanwhile, ranges developed and grew wider, and the other Brazilian historic brand, Phebo, fell into Christopher Freeman’s hands as well – but both needed a showcase to present their new faces. Again, Nazish Munchenbach drew inspiration from the brand’s movable heritage, delving into the past, and restoring the old furniture stored in the back shop of her very first pharmacy to redecorate and give a new boost to the historic store located on Primeiro de Março street, in Rio. “The dusty place still had this 70s Formica style,” she recalls. In 2005, it became the first flagship store of a long series, as Granado/Phebo counts more than 40 points-of-sale across Brazil today, as well as an online store. With Phebo and Granado, Brazilian customers - 40% of men - were able to bring back their memories of childhood scents, an integral part of their own stories. But they could also revive quality products with genuine fragrances like lavender, which, as it is associated with baby care in all families, conditioned Brazilian women’s taste for this scent from elsewhere. Soaps are plant-based, and skincare products are mostly formulated with natural ingredients, without being tested on animals. “We mainly aim for efficacy and safety, without going indiscriminately natural,” specifies Nazish Munchenbach. Now, the brand does not intend to stop at the 20% growth rate per year it has shown since 2005. In addition to the historic Phebo plant in Belem, it has just opened a new plant in the State of Rio to meet the production demand. It has also announced a 22% growth for the beginning of 2015, and is savouring an unexpected breakthrough on the French market. When cousins Mario and Antonio Santiago created Phebo in Belem in 1930, they intended - and managed - to compete with French brands, which dominated the market, by offering exclusively high-end, plant-derived products.  “More than 100 years later, things have gone our way, and it is a nice reward to see how warmly the French have welcomed Phebo and Granado products,” confesses Nazish Munchenbach. Indeed, given the results and craze the French quickly showed for these vintage, genuinely Brazilian products, the almost exclusive partnership with Le Bon Marché in Paris was extended. However, when the brand has found its ideal distribution channel, no doubt it will liberate itself from the left-bank Parisian department store. As an example, it opened a subsidiary in Paris in September 2013, and has also gradually appeared in a few points-of-sale elsewhere in France. “We have maintained relationships based on closeness with our partners in France. It is essential, because we value our Brazilian identity and want to keep it this way. Our country is quite popular in France,” concludes Nazish Muchenbach."
B. Kolormakeup opens a second factory,"""This is a brand new building,"" underlines Mario Luigi, co-founder, ""in which we installed all our powder activity and several research laboratories. We also divided, in the form of independent workshops, the different production types."" The current site of Treviglio will continue to house the other remaining research laboratories and the production of products in an emulsion form. With a 40% increase in its turnover last year, compared to the previous year and a 2015 start to the year particularly tonic, B. Kolormakeup & Skincare is unquestionably reaping the fruits of its past years’ innovation and investments policy.  ""An increase in activity, which forced us to step up last year, again the number of production machines,"" explains Mario Luigi. The other ingredients in this winning recipe, we were told at the Head Office, being, research, innovation and business strategy. ""We are a small company with all the advantages of flexibility and proximity and we want to preserve this exception,"" insists Mario Luigi.  ""It is not a question of growing for the sake of growing. We have earned the trust of customers who rely on us and our service capacity."" Commercial successes, which are of course directly related to the Italian company’s product development strategy. ""One of our strengths,” insist company officials, “is to continue to develop ourselves drawing our inspiration from what is happening around the world, especially this so-called ‘natural’ trend, through the development of high performance organic products. A research work, which started ten years ago, and which is for us a source of great satisfaction and concrete orders. To date, among the latest examples of innovations, we have developed a new range of products, called ‘second skin’ that perfectly expresses this need for invisible perfection."" With this in mind, B. Kolormakeup will present around forty new products at the next MakeUp in Paris tradeshow. Not to be missed..."
"“Pour Toujours”, with Martine Denisot","While she was busy with her career in communication and tourism, Martine Denisot longed to penetrate the secrets of perfumery, but kept it to herself. The day she met Jacques Polge was a fortunate coincidence: he opened the doors of the Chanel Laboratory for her to “train her nose”, watch, and learn. She dissected raw materials, investigated dilutions, and experienced creation for a whole year. These first steps in the inner circle of perfumery reinforced her desire to be part of it. She went on with her training at Cinquième Sens, where she met Anne-Sophie Behaghel and Amélie Bourgeois, who she later supported by becoming her associate as part of the Flair olfactory creation studio project. At that stage, Martine Denisot could finally create; and she did not think twice. For herself, her family, her husband, and the people around her, but just for fun. Then, it is an unexpected collaboration with Lostmarc’h that gave her a boost. She composed a mist around quince, inspired from the gardens in her native Berry region, in central France. The idea of commercially sharing her creations eventually became reality, and this is how the Pour Toujours collection was recently given birth. The six fragrances introducing this new confidential perfume range are presented in a pretty bottle capped with porcelain and luxuriously laid in Philippe Di Méo cases. The formulas are short, but very sophisticated, and mostly with natural raw materials. “I am trying to create cocoon, ‘feel-good’ perfumes that correspond to the slow movement philosophy”, Martine Denisot explains. Bootylicious, a floral fruity fragrance also worked with quince, is combined with the Davana flower, among others; Tudo Bem evokes the soft atmosphere typical of Brazil, like a caipirinha scented with citrus fruit, bergamot orange, citron, mint, ginger, and black pepper; Pyrus is a pear and vetiver fruity perfume; Graines, a childhood memory at the seed merchant’s, with barley, cocoa, cardamom, and oregano aromas; Boule de Gomme smells like the softness of orange blossom and lavender, while Khasmin is a narcissus, jasmine, saffron and sandal Oud perfume blown away by the desert winds… The collection will be exclusively available at the Bon Marché, in Paris, in June, at 160 euros for 100ml."
Private Label: the Arthes Group widens its offering,"With no less than seven new contracts in 2014 and both home fragrances and perfume creations, the Private Label department of the Arthes Group has achieved a two-digit growth since it was launched four years ago. It already represents 10 to 15% of the company’s turnover. “The team gradually structured itself. It now counts four full-time employees and works in perfect synergy with the other departments,” explains François Papyle, who used to work at L’Oréal and Panini and joined the Arthes Group in October 2014 as the Sales Director. The strong presence of the Arthes sales teams with mass distribution buyers in France and around the world makes it possible to report information on the needs expressed by brands. “This is a considerable business advantage,” François Papyle emphasizes. The services of the Private Label department of the group are mainly turned towards export (90% of the activity), in particular to Europe and the Middle East. They started by attracting the major drugstore chains seeking affordable products developed by private labels. Decoration and textile brands are also growing more and more interested. Another advantage of the Arthes Group in this sector is its production capacity of over 120,000 bottles per day, which helps meet the conditioning demand from numerous international brands. With 75 maceration tanks and 7 fully automated filling chains, the group has one of the largest perfume production plants in the south of France. The investments that came with the group’s launching of the brand Jeanne in the French region of Provence – a cosmetics formulation laboratory was built and a conditioning workshop for toiletries and body care products opened – now make it possible for the Arthes Group to produce numerous cosmetics to complement perfumes. “Obviously, this enables us to widen our offering to new categories like skincare and body care as a Private Label, and to consider growing at the same fast pace in this sector,” François Papyle concludes. The French company will be on the exhibitors’ list at the next PLMA’s World of Private Label show, the reference event for Private Label and mass distribution in Europe, which will be held next May 19 and 20, 2015 at the RAI Exhibition Centre in Amsterdam, Netherlands."
"Flair, a creation studio in the service of artistic perfumery","They met at Cinquième Sens, where they also got to know Martine Denisot, who later joined the Flair project as well. Amélie and Anne-Sophie share the same olfactory language and sensitivity. They complete each other in the creation process, as one enjoys working with natural ingredients, while the other prefers delicate synthetic materials. Their credo: making surprising, but wearable and bearable perfumes. This desire makes sense to young creators of niche perfume brands seeking new inspirations and the guarantee of a very precise, sophisticated creation work with the materials. Flair, a free spirit in the perfume sector, enjoys its independence and plays with its ability to develop compositions with exclusive ingredients. “It is the small volumes specific to artistic perfumery that make it possible. We are always seeking unusual, differentiating raw materials that tell a story”, the duo explains, giving the example of Piri Piri, a plant with hallucinogenic properties sourced from Peru by Stéphane Piquart, a rare ingredient expert. It was incorporated into their latest creation, Une nuit à Bali. Amélie and Anne-Sophie are confident, stimulated by the increase in the perfume extract volumes sold by the studio every year. They believe in a grand future for French perfumery and have been investing in brands. “We bank on the success of the brands we work with. They know we are at their side to defend our perfumes – this is our added value, and it is in our interest too,” Amélie Bourgeois explains. Amélie Bourgeois and Anne-Sophie Behaghel will be presenting Flair at the next Beauty World show in Dubai, and willingly admit they aim to reach the Middle East creation market. “Perfumery there is generous, very oud-oriented, and absolutely voluptuous. Many brands are developing there right now. And we would like to add a little more artistic, different touch to their compositions. They are actually quite open to novelty”, Anne-Sophie concludes."
Aircos reaps the benefits of its innovation strategy,"Premium Beauty News - You are one of the only companies in France, if not the only one, to be able to boast about a double activity, plastic injection and formula production, for the cosmetics sector! Frédéric Lancesseur - Indeed, our operations are fully integrated, and we can assert this double activity. Besides, it is actually thanks to our double expertise that we decided and were able to develop a new back injection process called IPM, which makes it possible for us to put forward our mastery of the container/content compatibility. This technology requires our know-how both in formulation and injection. It was entirely developed by the company. This new process enables not to “traumatize” the ingredients (in particular pigments and pearlescent agents), and therefore obtain amazing softness and brightness. Premium Beauty News – And you have actually grown enough to offer industrial production in this field, haven’t you? Frédéric Lancesseur - Absolutely, we developed a high-capacity automated machine as early as last year. And the percentage represented by this new technique in Aircos’s turnover has risen to about 20%. Besides, this only served to reinforce what was already one of our advantages: our ability to guarantee our customers a full service offer. This new technique presents many advantages for us: optimum results in terms of textures, forms and surface effects, an extremely clean process, and a very competitive technology. Premium Beauty News – And this technology eventually drove you to refocus on your core business!  Frédéric Lancesseur - It has to be said, our company is organized around three major activities. First, plastic injection is carried out on our site in Ardon, near Orléans in the central region of France, where 33 injection machines and several automated assembly and finishing lines are operating. Then, formulations are developed in two laboratories located in Boulogne-Billancourt, near Paris, and Romorantin, also in central France. Lastly, manufacturing and conditioning are also carried out in Romorantin, where the plant has a production and conditioning capacity of more than 110 million units per year. We have taken the necessary steps to become full service specialists. This clearly constitutes a cornerstone in the development of Aircos. We have expertise in all phases of makeup production, which, to our customers, makes us responsible for every aspect of the product, including, of course, the packaging part. However, our main development strategy is focused on powders. Mastering different powder formulation and production technologies represents one of our cornerstones, which obviously makes it legitimate for us to boast about an excellent expertise in the “complexion” segment: eye shadows, loose powders, body powders, etc. Premium Beauty News – No doubt 2015 will be a year of exports! Thomas Sirot - Among other things, yes, it will! As an example, we will take part in the MakeUp in New York show for the first time as exhibitors. It is clear the North American market represents a development potential for Aircos. We aim for our exports to reach between 20% and 25% of our turnover by 2017, compared to 10% right now. Today, we are holding all the cards: perfect control in R&D, and unique technologies and processes. In addition, the euro has weakened, and some brands wish to highlight their “Made in France” production. Premium Beauty News - Which new products are you going to launch next June at MakeUp in Paris? Thomas Sirot -  Our main product innovations comprise a range entirely dedicated to the face contouring/sculpting trend, specific eyebrow formulas, and unique powder sampling concepts, including a “Small is beautiful” range to come out as soon as June 18."
"“We are returning to Marionnaud’s roots,” Eileen Yeo","Premium Beauty News - How will the launch of ""Code Beauté"" impact the relationship between Marionnaud and its customers? Eileen Yeo - “Code Beauté” is opening a new era in terms of how Marionnaud addresses the needs of its customers.  This new service will help us to better understand our customers’ needs and to treat them individually.  Collected data will also help us to define what each of them really expects from us and to customize our communication.  We are shifting from ""one to all"" communication to ""one to one"" communication. Premium Beauty News - Another brick of your new brand strategy, in the wake of the deployment of your new store concept? Eileen Yeo - It’s not really a repositioning but a return to our roots: proximity, personalisation, services and expertise.  What we offer our customers is to explain the products and provide advice.  This is Marionnaud’s DNA and has never been highlighted so clearly. Premium Beauty News - Nevertheless, the new store concept is transforming the shopping experience! Eileen Yeo - Our goal was to illustrate our expertise and proximity to customers.  Therefore, we selected softer materials and soft colours so consumers feel at home, with no pressure.  There is a lot of wood, a warm ambiance and no loud music.  Beyond the décor, this concept also features several integrated services, many of which are free. Today, consumers are searching for new and different experiences. That’s exactly what we want to bring to them.  We have tested this concept in various environments, in Paris, in the North and South of France and also in Italy, with very good results. Premium Beauty News - What is your opinion about the evolution of the French beauty market? Eileen Yeo - Europe in general is a difficult market and France is no exception.  My opinion is that retail is too focused on prices and promotions.  We have to provide more to customers and offer them a truly unique shopping experience. Premium Beauty News - I assume that this includes your own product lines? Eileen Yeo - Marionnaud’s private label products are key elements of our development strategy. We’ll continue to extend our own range of products, but we want to offer only what is useful to our customers."
"“Any lever is possible on the perfume market”, Alexandrine Demachy, Fragrance Resources France","Premium Beauty News - What are your observations on the perfume market right now? Alexandrine Demachy - Even if, from an economic standpoint, China and Brazil are slowing down in growth, what can be noted is that brands have been adapting to these markets, whether on a structural level or with their product offer. Large groups have been streamlining their structures in Europe to grow in emerging countries. They develop specific products there, or buy local brands to establish themselves firmly in these regions. There has been a new diversification in many fields on the global scale. Several models work well, there is no longer only one approach possible, and that is why the largest groups are starting to take interest in smaller ones. Premium Beauty News - Absolutely, and many alternative brands have recently been purchased by large groups. What conclusions should be drawn, then? Alexandrine Demachy - This is a very different philosophy in terms of acquisition. It is all about recognizing an expertise here. Companies seek to take these structures as a model, from their modes of creation down to their means of distribution, which are very close to consumers. And this has consequences on us creators. In the selective segment, the olfactory dimension only represents about 5% of the value of the product sold, the remaining part being related to marketing, communication, packaging, etc. The ratio is reversed in alternative perfumery. Differentiation is achieved through creativity, the selection of raw materials, and the price. We have to adapt to this new trend, because it is favourable to us. Our short and light structure makes it possible for Fragrance Resources to achieve this. Premium Beauty News - In light of this new order, could this lead to rethinking the method of remuneration of perfume composition companies, which today is only based on the volume, and not on creation? Alexandrine Demachy - This is a recurring question. It is true the whole creation process is completely free, regardless of the call for tenders. This specificity is to be taken into account, because contrary to architects or advertising companies, we have to cover the development costs related to projects that have not been acquired yet. But brands feel attached to them, and even if there were a will to change things, there would have to be a consensus. Premium Beauty News - You were talking about China, although it is a region where the perfume sector has hardly developed yet. Do you still believe in it? Alexandrine Demachy -  Sure, Asia will eventually reveal itself, and the relationship with perfumes will change. In China, perfumes are currently viewed as products that help gain recognition, gift-products for those who want to bring out their comfortable status. But Chinese people travel more and more and are learning a lot about the Western world, so they will end up using perfumes for themselves. But this will take time. Premium Beauty News - There seem to be many growth drivers. Is the future of perfumery all mapped out? Alexandrine Demachy - Perfumes will always be a mode of seduction. As long as there is love, there will be perfumes, and I am confident about their future. However, there will be a huge upheaval on all axes. It is true, any lever is possible: creation, distribution, regionalization, mode of scenting… everyone is already positioning themselves. So one has to ask the right questions: how to attract young people, how to make European consumers take interest again, how to deal with the sourcing problem when our planet increasingly has to produce more to feed itself… We must build the future."
Geka is strengthening its strategy on beauty accessories,"Premium Beauty News - How did you adapt your production tools to support your increased service strategy? Luca Bistoletti - We chose to strengthen first our European production tools and the control with our Asian suppliers. We have a minimum of three partner suppliers for each type of product to ensure optimum production and quality. At Bechhofen, the headquarters of Geka in Europe, we have a storage capacity of 5,000 pallets which therefore enables us to supply our European customers in days. For example, we have developed with one of our retailer customers a replenishment activity. We handle the management of their stock of accessories and we are capable of restocking any product and to deliver it directly in stores. This is what sets us apart from our competitors. We are integrated in the organization of our clients and offer value-added services. This year we have increased particularly our investments at Geka Asia Pacific, with our offices in Shanghai and Hong Kong. It is primarily a commercial entity, but we want to be as close as possible to our suppliers based in China, Korea, Thailand and Taiwan, and manage the production related risks to limit flaws and ensure that our products have the highest quality. Premium Beauty News - Have you already identified the first results of this strategy? Luca Bistoletti -  We have doubled in size in just eight years, and our sales in 2014 are in excess of 20 million euros. Our development is partly due to organic growth but also to winning over new customers. Premium Beauty News - What types of products do you offer and for which markets? Luca Bistoletti - Our offer consists of make-up accessories (brushes, applicators, sponges, false eyelashes, etc.), bags (kits, brush holders, etc.), haircare products (brushes, accessories, etc.), and products for well-being, body and face care. We also offer accessories for manicure and pedicure, technical and fine brushes (accessories for hairdressers). Everything is produced and packaged ""ready-to-be-sold"" at the POS. We operate both on mass markets and prestige markets, through direct sales or as a custom manufacturer, with all the major beauty players. Premium Beauty News - What is your main advantage on the market? Luca Bistoletti -  Our know-how is unique and prestigious. Beyond our products in Asia, we own a historical production site based in Bechhofen, for the manufacturing of shaving brushes, among others. With the revival of beards and moustaches of all kinds and the 1920s/1930s coming back into fashion, our expertise is very much appreciated. We can produce a wide range of brushes depending on the desired level of personalization and the brand’s prestige. Our craftsmen come from schools located within Bechhofen where the trade of ""master brush maker"" is taught. Premium Beauty News - Finally, can you tell us more about your strategy in 2015? Luca Bistoletti - We want to focus on marketing and innovation to increase our added value. We already have a good system in place, a good reputation on the market. We want to introduce a little more creativity, and in particular promote our local production. The ""made in Germany"" is an undeniable asset on the market, and we are looking at the fashion industry for possible opportunities. Furthermore, Asia is becoming for us a destination market. The market is growing and local brands are strengthening. It will become for us not just a sourcing hub, but potentially a growing marketplace and we are working on several interesting projects that will allow us to tap into this market. More to come on this in the near future. In conclusion, our expertise and knowledge of the market are undoubtedly undeniable assets to meet the expectations and requirements of the global beauty market."
Make-up industry: Taiwanese suppliers are in working order (part 2),"Specialized in the production of make-up compacts (60% of its activity), A&P Unico, another Taiwanese-based company since 1987, has an integrated production site in Guangzhou, China, providing full service starting from product design, mould building of packaging, to formulation and filling operations. Georges Huynh, the founder and President of A&P Unico, adopted and implemented high-level management systems to this site, the Taiwanese way, from his past successful experience in Taiwan. “Being an expert in the packaging field,” explained Bonnie Huynh, Assistant of the President of A&P, “A&P has more than 400 standard packaging items for clients to choose. Combining with our formulation and filling services, we could help our clients to cope with the rapidly changing markets, and stay competitive. Recently, besides our in-house spraying, lacquering, and metalizing, we are proud to announce our 2 new decoration methods: 3D printing and Gel Top! These innovations have also created more personalized and trendy packaging for clients. As a result, A&P has become not only a renowned supplier, but also a reliable and sustainable business partner for some famous cosmetic brands from all over the world.” Bottlemate is a superb Korean company from Taiwan, founded in 1982, which now weighs about 80 million dollars in sales with a total workforce of 600 people, located in Taiwan, China, in Los Angeles (since 1990) and Germany (since 2006). Historically specialized in the production of jars, vials, airless bottles and various plastic containers, in 2012 the firm reached another milestone in its full service strategy with the creation of Cospro, specialized in the formulation and filling of cosmetics. A strategy that will be intensified this year with a 20% increase in the investment planned for this segment. In 2013, the company, continuing its expansion, created a branch in Tokyo. “Through the IS0 9001 Quality Control System, and ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systematic Authentication,” explained Kevin Tseng, Executive vice General Manager, “Bottlemate maintains sound internal business operations and client database, from raw materials to manufactured products, from business managements to production environment, we all follow precise ISO regulations. We guarantee precision in all aspects of our production with an innovative mind set.” “To meet today’s market demands, Bottlemate actively engages in on-going research and development of new products, from a diverse range of products, creating the most innovative products for our clients. At the same time, we impose strict quality control prior to the marketing of new products. We conduct vacuum, torque, heat/freeze testing, and carefully measure capacity and size specifications to guarantee the correct size prior to market circulation. We also conduct a secondary inspection before product packaging, and again prior to shipping in order to preserve our product’s quality. Consistent product quality control is systematically conducted prior to shipping.” “Cho Chuang Industrial Co., Ltd. is one of the leading cosmetics manufacturers in the Taiwan Area,” explains Connie Liu, Commercial Director. “Since 1981, we have developed aluminium products. We then created our own mould factory with empty container manufacturing and hot stamping/ printing equipment and a Lab specialised in make-up products. These 20 years of continuous efforts have enabled us to gather valuable experience and become a professional and reliable cosmetics supplier. Requiring a variety of expertises, our make-up products range from empty cosmetic containers to finished products. We offer OEM and ODM services. In 2003, our company passed the ISO9001 certification. This is one of our competitive advantages.  The main products manufactured are empty cosmetic containers (mascara, lip gloss, eyeliner and lipstick cases, power cases and nail polish bottles) but also finished cosmetic products (mascara, lip gloss, eyeliner, eye shadow, foundations, lipstick, nail polish, etc.).” On the industrial side, the company has five production sites. The management plans to relocate all five production sites, to a single 12,000 sqm site by the end of this year. Total turnover, 20 million euros, 70% of which coming from formulation. Progression rate expected this year, +30%.  Main investments to come: new assembly machines. “We are not only a professional cosmetic packaging manufacturer and supplier,” emphasises Connie Liu, “but we also offer OEM and ODM customized services. We have a large-scale factory and a complete production line to manufacture numerous cosmetics products. Our company was granted the ISO9001 certification in 2003. We have been in business for 30 years, manufacturing cosmetic packaging, formulations and turn key products. Our main products include eye-shadows, eyeliners, mascaras, lipgloss, nail polish, face compact powders, blushers, lipsticks, foundations, and so on.”"
Make-up industry: Taiwanese suppliers are in working order (part 1),"The main characteristic of some of these skincare and make-up suppliers: an almost total integration! For many of them, their salvation depends on it.  In these conditions, it is not surprising, while wandering in the aisles of the production sites, to visit one after the other, the workshop for the manufacturing of moulds, the workshop for injection machines, to then enter into the area dedicated to the manufacturing of formulas, followed by the one which is home to filling and conditioning machines. A strategy initiated a long time ago by some players, but that is promised to “pay off” today due to the growing demand for full service. At any rate, these industrialists do not seem to be bothered by the fact of needing to master several trades to be successful... “We are used to it, they say, and our independence and our flexibility are well worth the difficulties that may be paving the way to technological changes!” “We are specialized in the packaging of nail polish”, explained Thomas Hwang, Commercial Director. “The company started in 1977 as a small humble factory supplying goods locally in Taiwan. Business grew progressively and operation expanded to China in the late 90s to satisfy different export needs. After all these years of interacting in this global market, we are convinced that the keys to successful results are the right products with the right pricing and the right timing. Our cumulative experiences in production and in a wide range of finishes, give us the ability to consistently deliver customized packaging to suit individual requirements. We strive to serve each and every customer like if it were our own business and deliver accordingly for a mutually beneficial and sustainable long term relationship, we aim to grow together with our customers, not just as a one-time partner.” Pinkpac is the typical example of the Taiwanese company whom after several years of production in China, decided to relocate all of its production back to Taiwan for continuous improvement. “We are probably one of the very few nail polish packaging suppliers that focus packaging mainly for nail polish use, hence various customization technology available developed for this area. Our product portfolio consists of between three to four hundred different models, with two hundred readily available”. These are the company’s own design made available for standard production, but Pinkpac also works on customized shapes. “We export 100+ million units annually worldwide and we continue to look after both mass market and also customized high end market to suit the different need. The latest technology developed for decoration is a new type of printing technique that has no limitation on print colours unlike conventional silk screen on cap, as long as it is a flat surface or slightly curved surface, we can print anything from a simple one colour logo to a portrait of Monalisa on cap. This brings infinite possibilities for decoration on cap and is visually very eye catching. This benefit we provide the customer is the result of the continuous development we focus on our products.” The Tonnie Cosmetics Company is a fine example of how successful the Taiwanese industry can be in this area. A company headquartered in Tainan City that employs a total of 600 people over two production sites, one in Tainan and the other in China. Main customer markets, in declining order, the United States (35%), Europe (30%) including England and Germany, followed by Middle East. The factory in Tainan, which is home to 48 injection machines, is fully integrated in terms of full service for make-up (it even has its own team of designers!), a sector which today accounts for 90% of the company’s revenues. Main investment planned this year (1 million dollars): to increase the number of assembly machines. The company mainly produces make-up compacts and palettes and lipsticks, but also a full range of make-up products.  “We offer a complete range of make-up & skincare lines with superior quality at the most reasonable prices,” explained Jane Ko, Commercial Director.  “We run complete production lines with consistent integrated operations, including formulation research, packaging design, component mould, filling, assembling, packing, etc. We are GMP and ISO22716:2007 (E) certified and our products comply with FDA, EEC and global regulations. Tonnie has its in house certified laboratory and we also have our strict Quality Control and contracted SGS inspections.” Another example of Taiwanese contract manufacturing in the particularly dynamic make-up packaging segment, the Cosmety Company aka Decorative Cosmetic Container Co. The firm was founded in 1982 by Yun Chang Su. It is based in Wuci Dist in Taichung City and has twenty injection machines. Turnover in 2014, 33 million dollars for a total staff of forty people. It has gone from strength to strength since it was established about 30 years ago. It passed the ISO 9001 international Quality Certification in December 2008. The company is also highly integrated in tooling development, design, injection, manufacturing, and decoration of cosmetic packagings. “One of our particular strength,” explained Nathan Su, Production Director, “is that we have our in-house tooling department where our R&D team utilizes our customers’ samples or drawings to analyse, design, plan and manufacture the most efficient and precise mould structures. Also, our injection techniques have made us more flexible and helped our customers accelerate the launching of their products.”  “Since Cosmety’s inception, our production team has been in charge with coordinating finished mould development with product manufacturing. Our goal has always been to provide quality products to our customers at extremely competitive prices.  Creativity and innovation are at the heart of our R&D department,"" added Jenny Wu from the commercial department.  “Over the years, we have developed a range of compacts and jars. To benefit our customers, we offer a full pallet of testing equipment that our R&D team uses for each customer’s sample or drawing, to analyse, design, plan, and manufacture the most efficient and precise mould structure. Our R&D department not only possesses solid research capabilities, but also communicates clearly with customers on their market positioning and the design baseline from the very beginning. By researching, thinking and innovating continuously, we ensure each design meets both the needs of our customers and adds value to their goods.” Main focus for the firm, be more open to US and European markets.

Chromavis Fareva: Total creativity for the fourth edition of Chromaville in Bologna,"In a new location of over 1,000 square metres at “Autostazione di Bologna”, Chromavis Fareva has developed a fantastic world of colours and trends for its customers and suppliers in a so-called “unusual and visionary” urban path made of products, collections, trends but also of important novelties. “Visionnaire” definitely aimed to be a real open-air laboratory, the room of ideas, a path to fight the frenzy and the pretence of an immediate innovation and to give space to the creativity of those who visit it. Anyone who entered this room past through a labyrinth made of tissues, fabrics, objects, unusual materials and installations away from the cosmetic world but capable of generating inspirations for future products, concepts and systems. Everything there was in continuous evolution, thanks to the presence of a group of researchers and trend-hunters that - together with Chromavis - have identified and represented with their installations the nine moods that will materialize in trends over the next three/five years."
Hwa Sung: a new plant to better cope with the dynamics of innovation!,"Premium Beauty News - These past few months were particularity busy for Hwa Sung. A new factory and new offices! Kim E.H - Indeed, we decided to build our own plastic injection plant, called ANP, while keeping our network of suppliers. This allows us to be much more flexible for the development and marketing of our products. The plant is home to 20 injection machines and with a staff of 50 people. It was built following the highest standards in terms of production quality. As for the new offices, it is true that the time had come to move to more functional premises. Premium Beauty News - The Asian Beauty market is still recording an important growth. What do you see as you main strong points to be successful in this competitive market? Kim E.H - Our strength is innovation!!! Our range includes single use products and four-in-one Slim Stick size products. Our innovation-focused strategy greatly satisfies our customers who are happy to use a product that is easy to carry and that takes up very little space. Our products are up to the expectations of professionals who demand the highest quality. Our range of Eyebrow Pencils enjoys an excellent reputation abroad. All our customers say they are very successful on their market with this type of product. Our strength lies undoubtedly in our quick decision making and flexibility. We are very reactive to customer demands. Premium Beauty News - Your presence is international. You therefore have a global vision of the evolution of demand at an international level. In your opinion, what main criteria characterize the world’s four major markets, which are Europe, North America, South America and Asia? Kim E.H -  In Europe, the decision process is very slow and all the components of a project are very thoroughly considered, sometimes over considered. The launch of a new product is often difficult, but once it is on the market everything then runs smoothly. While in North America, if products displayed show a new and innovative concept, it can go much faster. South America is growing fast almost like Asia. Products from Asia are acclaimed all over the world, but this wave of success can also be reversed just as quickly. Products range from super low, to premium prices. Everything coexists. Premium Beauty News - What do you think 2015 will be like in your field, in Europe, the Americas and Asia? Kim E.H - Markets are changing very quickly especially because of the Internet. The world of beauty is a constantly connected one particularly via Facebook, among others. It has become so easy to share, compare, wanting to be the prettiest of all and therefore to buy more. Premium Beauty News - The concept of full service seems more and more present and desired. Do you agree? Kim E.H - We have always offered full service, so there is nothing new for us here and nothing to worry about. I really think full service makes things easier and more comfortable for the customer. This saves him a lot of time in product development and production. But on our side, we have to manage a lot of responsibilities in terms of production steps or delivery deadlines. Premium Beauty News - You exhibit at almost all the MakeUp in™ trade shows... In a few words what, do you believe are the key strengths of these events?  Kim E.H - We really love this event and we can feel that visitors are also really starting to love the Make Up shows that take place over two days (giving enough time to meet people). Make Up events are really upscale and very professional events. The exhibitor does not need to invest much time and money in the setting up of his stand, or in displaying his products. This allows him to spend more time on doing business. Conferences and industry news are also very useful. One last thing, the Beauteam team is always very friendly. This is important and I hope there will be many more Make-Up shows around the world."
"“Perfumes will always make people dream, but they must change,” Olivier de Lisle, Firmenich","Premium Beauty News - The perfume market is changing. Does that bring you any serenity? Olivier de Lisle - From a quantitative standpoint, according to the latest feedback from our customers and the various statistics published on selective perfumery, it seems the market is stable. Several important areas are experiencing economic difficulties, in particular Europe and Russia. And there is a slowdown in Brazil. Dynamics in the Gulf States and Asia partly make up for it, but not enough to be able to provide a positive impetus. However, this situation is not overwhelming for us: one can achieve a strong growth even on a stable market! Premium Beauty News - Apart from these current difficulties, we also have the impression consumption and purchase habits are evolving in perfumery. Olivier de Lisle - There are many ways to consume perfume right now. And there are many alternatives available apart from traditional channels such as selective distribution. Direct-selling plays a significant role in some countries. And specialty retail is also quickly developing, as can be seen with Victoria Secret in the United States, Yves Rocher in France, or Boticário in Brazil. This channel is doing well, in particular with the young generation, because it creates a universe, a form of closeness, a different shopping experience. As far as the high-end sector is concerned, there is the same phenomenon with prestige perfumery. Brands which possess wholly-owned stores like Dyptique or Jo Malone attract customers seeking a privileged purchasing experience. As an example, the recent acquisitions of alternative brands by major groups such as Estée Lauder or Puig will enable them to reach targets they do not or no longer have. Premium Beauty News – Talking about these new alternative brands, do you work for them a lot? Olivier de Lisle - At Firmenich, we aim to create perfumes for our customers to succeed. We are called to develop classics, but it is also our job to bet on entrepreneurs, just like we did with “Le Labo”. So yes, even if it only represents a small part of our activities, alternative perfumery is important to Firmenich. It makes it possible to create without any restraint, which constitutes another form of stimulation for our perfumers-creators. It is important to be aware that we only have twelve perfumers-creators in Paris, although that is where our largest creation centre is located. Perfumery is a world that is still extremely close to craftsmanship! That is why we can offer our customers a customized service. Premium Beauty News - Regulatory and supply-related issues now seem to play a major role in the world of perfume creation. Olivier de Lisle - Absolutely. The way regulations are evolving encourages us to renew our palette of creativity by taking into account the constraints. Innovation is more than ever crucial, with the search for new ingredients, and the likely evolution towards more naturalness. The supply issue is essential too. In addition to being a perfume creator, Firmenich is the main world supplier of perfumery ingredients. We must guarantee our customers total supply security from a qualitative, quantitative, and economic point of view. Today there are about a hundred critical raw materials in perfumery, for which a minimum of stability in terms of price and quality must be ensured. Many of these materials come from countries plagued by rural depopulation, where plantations are being abandoned for good as people flow towards large cities. In India, Laos, Uganda, Haiti… we have been investing in programmes to support rural populations and help them grow their cultures, while ensuring them stable incomes and prospects in the long term. We make sure these people get a stable income so they can plant, invest, and innovate. This is designed to be a long-lasting organization. Premium Beauty News - What are your challenges for the future? Olivier de Lisle - The challenge is to always adapt to market changes! We know there is arbitration in terms of luxury purchases today, and that perfumery is a highly competitive market, in particular with new technologies. But perfumes will always make people dream, as they provide intense emotions. Consumption habits have already changed a lot, and they will keep changing. Even if the presentation and means to diffuse perfumes are evolving, they will always constitute a significant preoccupation in our societies. So it is up to us to explore new territories."
The Alkos Group gets global,"The Alkos Group is on a roll! With a turnover of 47 million euros in 2014 and a target of 51 million for 2015 – a +36% growth over the period – the French subcontractor is entering a new phase in its development. “The group’s activity is now stable and strong, and it is growing significantly,” explains Florence Lefeuvre, Sales and Marketing Communications Director. “Obviously, developing on the global level represents an important growth driver for us.” The Alkos Group expects 35% of its consolidated sales to be destined for export in 2015 (15% in 2011).  As the French company intends to keep growing at the same rate and intensify its global development, it will strengthen its export team this year, in particular with a new recruit to join the team and create an International Business Development Director position. Florence Lefeuvre and Dominique Vautier are proud of this move: “We are very happy to welcome Eric Goyer, a great professional of the cosmetics industry. He will start working for the group at the Cosmopack show in Bologna”. “The European markets are a priority for us, of course, but also North America and Brazil,” Florence Lefeuvre emphasizes.  “The United States is at the core of our globalization strategy. We do not exclude the possibility of acquiring a local player if we get the opportunity to, especially if there is a complementarity or if we can diversify our industrial facilities…” The Alkos Group should also intensify its participation in the major international trade shows, with Cosmopack in Bologna, Italy, Beautyworld Middle East in Dubai, MakeUp in Paris, and MakeUp in New York this year. The Alkos Group is composed of three entities (Intercosmétiques, Alkos Cosmétiques, and Sagal). Today, 56% of its turnover comes from the makeup market, and this percentage should reach 63% in 2015, in particular thanks to the dynamism of Alkos Cosmétiques, the only French producer of cosmetics pencils, whose sales amounted to 15.8 million euros in 2014 (M€8.9 in 2011) and are expected to exceed 17 million in 2015, that is, almost a 90% growth between 2011 and 2015! The percentage of makeup formulations in the activities of Intercosmétiques also grew significantly, as it rose from 18% to 38% thanks to the success of the Chubby Jumbo Twist Lipsticks by Intercosmétiques. To Florence Lefeuvre, it all results from the increasing reliance on outsourcing in the makeup sector. “The specificity of the know-how, the importance of innovation, and the growing diversification of this category encourage brands to seek external industrial expertise.” As for industrial investments, the Group is to open a third wholly automated production line for plastic pencils as soon as April 2015. A series of investments is also scheduled on the mascara segment, in particular by fitting an existing line with conditioning and filling equipment. And the Alkos Group will present its first mascara products both at the Cosmopack show in Bologna, Italy, on March 19-22, 2015, and at MakeUp in Paris next June 18-19.  To be continued…"
Beauty retailer Marionnaud seeks repositioning with new store concept,"The 3P concept, its bright colours and its strong lighting, are officially over. Marionnaud’s outlet renovation program, which was launched in 2011, is shifting towards a new warmer and upscale store concept. Actually, the retailer is moving away from mass-market codes and is betting on the high-end values: warm welcome, services, and wellbeing. The company wants to please its customers with a high quality services and products.  ""We want to offer customers a unique shopping experience in a warm and human scale atmosphere,"" says Eileen Yeo, Managing Director of Marionnaud France. The retailer thus opted for a bright and soothing ambience, a palette of soft colour. The brand now wants to attract its customers with exclusive services and the discovery of new products rather than through an endless race to price discounts. One of the distinctive features of the new concept is the importance given to in-store free beauty services such as ""flash make-up"", in a dedicated area at the centre of the store, or with the “Ioma Link"" skin diagnosis now fully integrated within the skin care area. Some stores also offer a ""nail bar"" paying service offering a wide range of nail and manicure services, with or without an appointment. Moreover, all the Marionnaud stores offer free Click & Collect services. ""Today’s digital innovations, such as Click & Collect, Store to Door, Reserve and Collect, are the core of our customer strategy. They perfectly address customers’ expectations in term of services and increase the number of visits in our stores. Our priority is to link digital services with our in-store offer in order to provide our customers with a comprehensive shopping experience,"" adds Eileen Yeo. A pilot store was opened in 2013, rue des Martyrs in Paris, and the new concept was tested in 2014 in nine stores located in shopping malls or in city centres across the entire French territory. The new concept will now be deployed in priority in the 150 French stores that have not been renovated for the last 6 years. The program provides that 60 stores per year will be put in line with the new concept. ""2015 promises to be an extremely dynamic year for Marionnaud, with a lot of opportunities. We are redeveloping our network with several store relocations as well as new openings, with the aim to be closer from our customers,"" concludes Mrs Yeo. With more than 1,000 stores in Europe, including 519 in France, Marionnaud is one of the leading European retailers of high-end perfumes and cosmetics"
Nail polish: Fiabila inaugurates its new French production unit,"“To be the best and remain so”: Fiabila’s goal today finds its fullest expression to date in the opening of a second high-performance production unit in the company’s historic seat in the Eure-et-Loir region of France. The unit features 16 tanks dedicated to storing raw materials, four kilometers of pipeline to convey them without risk of cross-contamination, heightened computerization and security features for every step in the production process, except for coloring, an operation that remains deliberately artisanal. All of these improvements mean Fiabila can continue to ensure a nail polish offer of uncompromising pureness and performance. “The quality and performance of our formulas have been the basis of Fiabila’s commitment ever since the company’s founding in 1977. It was therefore essential to equip ourselves with an industrial tool that is at the forefront of technology. That was the goal for this new production unit which, in addition, fulfills our strategy of ensuring security, respect for the environment and social responsibility in order to satisfy the increasing demands of our clients,” said Pierre Miasnik, president and founder of Fiabila. For example, the company has reduced its carbon footprint through the capture and reprocessing of volatile compounds and the recycling of washing solvents. Receiving raw materials in bulk, in dedicated tanker trucks, will make it possible to economize on several thousand metal casks per year. Lastly, the increased automation mentioned above will contribute to reinforcing the security of personnel and improving work conditions overall. In tripling the production capacity of Fiabila’s French site, this ultra-modern facility makes it possible to respond to increased demand across market sectors, regardless of size. In fact, according to a recent study by Euromonitor, the worldwide market for nail polish is set to increase by 11% by 2016. In addition, in an effort to meet client demands worldwide, Fiabila announces the impending opening of new production units in Brazil and Russia. As the future looks promising for nail polish, Fiabila too can see the horizon in a rainbow of colours."
"“High shine and long wear are the leading trends in nails right now”, Mary van Praag, OPI","Premium Beauty News - How is your brand positioned today in the world of nail care? Mary van Praag - At OPI we believe nothing can change your look or your outlook faster than color. That is why our brand is built on innovation - both in long wear color and technology. The brand was originally founded in 1981 as a dental supply company when founder George Schaeffer noticed many of his customers were manicurists seeking quality acrylic formulas. With a solution in hand, George teamed up with co-founder, Suzi Weiss-Fischmann the “First Lady of Nails,” to create the now flagship OPI nail lacquer. By 1987, OPI became the first nail brand to trademark its iconic bottle – now one of the most recognizable in the world. Today, we remain dedicated to bringing salon professionals the next generation of nail innovations—like our new hybrid lacquer, Infinite Shine, and OPI GelColor offered in the same 150 iconic OPI lacquer shades you have come to know and love. Premium Beauty News - What do you ask your suppliers to bring you first, whether in terms of formulas or packaging?

Recent research provided by Kline & Company found OPI products to be the #1 brand of salon professionals worldwide. Without quality products, we would not be able to remain a trusted brand for both professionals and consumers. Premium Beauty News - What were, for your company, the main axes of development, in the past 12 months? Mary van Praag -  In the last 12 months, we have introduced two groundbreaking innovations. Our first being Infinite Shine, a long lasting, photo-activated lacquer which delivers up to 10 days of intense shine and wear without the complications of gel application or soak-off removal.

We also know nail art is here to stay, so plan on seeing nail art looks that experiment with nude colors in an exciting way. Premium Beauty News - What are your ambitions at an international level? Mary van Praag - With OPI currently being in more than 100 countries and truly being a global brand, our main ambition is to continue expansion worldwide.

"“We want a harmonious development”, Thierry Aubry-Lecomte, Natura Brasil France","Premium Beauty News - Natura Brasil is not much present outside South America. Do you consider getting more aggressive to conquer global markets? Thierry Aubry-Lecomte - First of all, it is essential to understand our philosophy. Since the very beginning, Natura’s raison d’être has always been to remain humble while contributing to the creation of a better world. We do not advocate growth at all costs. Our economy is based on social and environmental commitment. This is the actual backbone of our group. We make sure we work with small producers using environmentally friendly practices, and we get involved in education, training, and land renewal. As for products, we started developing refills as soon as 1983, our packs are ecodesigned and they all bear environmental labels. Now, at the level of the group, we have been carbon neutral since 2007 and we aim at having a positive impact. Everything we do is intended to improve our footprint, and we have worked on that for over 40 years now, in accordance with our bem estar bem philosophy – well-being and being good – which aims to combine personal well-being and emphatic well-being with others, nature, and the world. Premium Beauty News - So what is the current position of the group on the global level? Thierry Aubry-Lecomte - We have been present everywhere in Latin America and France for ten years. And we are now on various continents, as Natura recently purchased Aesop, an Australian brand in perfect symbiosis with our values. This position helps us observe the different markets, which we will try to enter at our own pace. Aesop also made it possible for us to integrate the retail expertise into the group. We greatly value words like humility and wisdom: they make us connect with the rhythm of the Earth and take shape on a sustainable basis. Premium Beauty News - Why did Natura choose France? Thierry Aubry-Lecomte - When we arrived in France in 2005, we aimed at learning from a mature, extremely competitive country. We were willing to face difficulty and get the richest experience from it. That is when we set up a research laboratory and opened the store located Place Michel Debré in Paris. Premium Beauty News - What about it now? Thierry Aubry-Lecomte -  The laboratory does not exist anymore because we have switched to open innovation: research is spread over several sites and often carried out in partnership with universities of all continents. The store in Paris is our only physical point of sale in France for now, but there might be more of them in the future. Besides, we have set up a network of 2,000 direct-selling advisors throughout the French territory. This network counts 1.7 million people all around the world (mainly women), including 1.2 million in Brazil, and the rest in Latin America. This is where the brand’s hub lies, because it guarantees a unique customer relationship, and it also represents an essential social pillar. Direct-selling is not anchored in the French culture, so we are proud of this network, as it contributes to convey Natura’s principles and product quality, again, thanks to our customer relationship. We aim at uniting digital technologies and advisors. That is why this network has been supported by an e-commerce site since November 2014: people can contact an advisor in their own region and get personalized tips or buy directly from the website. Online selling is a way to conquer new customers, but also to make our advisors’ work easier and improve their turnover. This coherent model was developed in France and might prefigure the evolution of Natura’s distribution in the world. Premium Beauty News - You have no icon, and you never launch any campaign in the media. How could you make Natura more famous among French women? Thierry Aubry-Lecomte -  That is true, there is no Natura icon, because we consider beauty cannot be personified, it lies within each and every one of us. Besides, even if we do not appear much in advertisements, we are actually very active on social networks. For example, our Facebook page counts almost 9 million fans around the world, including 28,000 in France. It takes time to communicate such a meaningful message as ours, and that is why it is essential to have a good contact with consumers. Once they have got familiar with our products, they are very loyal to us. They are attracted by transparency, quality, and our commitment. And Brazil makes them dream!"

No clumping, flaking or hardening. 12h long-lasting and waterproof. The bristle brush of the Liquid Applicator perfectly supports the coating of each hair."
Atelier Cologne aims to lead the niche fragrances segment,"This is a beautiful story that begins in 2006 when Sylvie Ganter met Christophe Cervasel in New York. One year later Atelier Cologne - the first Maison de Parfum dedicated entirely to cologne, the legendary fragrance classic - was born.  For the first time, citruses - the traditional ingredients of a cologne - were blended with the most precious raw materials in perfumery to create original creations with evocative names such as Orange Sanguine, Rose Anonyme, Vétiver Fatal, Bois Blonds, Santal Carmin, Vanille Insensée, Cédrat Enivrant, Pomelo Paradis, etc.  Thanks to a very high concentration of essential oils these colognes enjoy an outstanding lasting power. Atelier Cologne was launched in 2007 in the United States in a very selective high-end retail network of department stores, including Bergdorf Goodman in New York and Neiman Marcus in all major US cities.  The brand currently generates 20 million euros (17.5 million US dollars) in retail sales, about 7 million euros (6 million US dollars) at the company level. The brand is now available in 26 countries and 300 stores, including four own stores in Paris and New York. After having doubled its turnover in 2013, the brand has increased its sales by +75% in 2014.  Atelier Cologne makes 15% of its sales in France, 20% in the rest of Europe and in Russia, 35% in the United States and Canada, 14% in Asia, including China, 10% in the Middle East and 6% on the internet. In total, more than 500,000 bottles of Cologne Absolue have been sold worldwide since the creation of the brand, which has been profitable since its very first year and every year since. However such a growth needs to be funded! After having sold their respective apartments in order to finance the first steps of the brand, Sylvie Ganter and Christophe Cervasel found four business angels whose contribution allowed the opening of the Paris boutique in 2012. In 2013, a capital increase of 2.5 million euros was completed in less than 6 months. The company’s governance was not modified, however the board was strengthened with the participation of strategy, retail, finance and emerging markets experts. From June 2014, a new round began with the aims to raise 5 million euros and to welcome a strong financial partner, interested the growth potential of company and able to support the brand in the long term while allowing the founders to keep a majority stake in the company. After several months of discussions, an agreement was reached with the Extendam, a private equity fund that decided to invest 2.5 million euros in the company. The pool of the initial investors brought 1.5 million euros more and, according to the founders, new entrants would have subscribed the last million already. The company’s aim is to close this fundraising round before the month of June 2015 These new resources will enable Atelier Cologne to deploy the next steps of its development plan and, first of all, to open new stores and thus to stimulate the sales in all the other channels. Among the cities under consideration are: Hong Kong, Seoul, Shanghai, Dubai, London, Cannes, Paris (left bank), New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Other actions include the strengthening of partnerships with historical customers, the development of sales in the travel retail channel, the strengthening of the website and of online sales, as well as several new product developments planned for 2015, 2016 and 2017. Atelier Cologne once again forecasts to double its turnover in 2015 to reach a volume of retail sales of 40 million euros, and to reach the 100 million euro bar soon, thus becoming the leader of the niche fragrances segment, which currently represents 4 to 5% of the global selective perfumery market. ""With the emergence of the niche fragrances segment, which washed over department stores and the most prestigious beauty store concepts, authentic perfume houses could represent 20-25% of the global market soon,"" said Christophe Cervasel, Chairman and CEO of Atelier Cologne. Atelier Cologne’s innovative concept, the quality of their ultra-selective distribution, their customized products and their solid financial base, are first class assets that should help the brand to achieve its goals."

The Different Company celebrates its 15th anniversary,"The two creators wanted to break free from the traditional codes, briefs and costs of fragrance creation to get back to exceptionality. When Luc Gabriel took over the reins of the company in 2004, after the departure of Jean Claude Ellena, the brand gave tribute to exceptional creation by entrusting famous fragrance creators such as Céline Ellena, Christine Nagel, Bertrand Duchaufour, Emilie Coppermann, Corine Cachen, Delphine Jelk and Alexandra Monet. The brand offers a total of 24 references over 3 collections - L’Esprit Cologne, Collection Classique and Collection Excessive. Nuit Magnétique, The Different Company’s latest fragrance, was created in 2014 by Christine Nagel. To celebrate the brand’s 15th anniversary, two new fragrances are expected in 2015: a 15th fragrance should be added to the Collection Classique, as well as a creation by Bertrand Duchaufour for the Collection Excessive. ""For any new creation, I make sure the consistence of our lines and our fragrances is respected, but I also introduce bold and innovative scents in the collections. We want to explore all avenues with various states of mind and compositions while keeping in line with the style of each collection and each creator. Raw materials must be exceptional and in proportions allowing them to express their own characteristics. Our keywords are Elegance, Innovation, Top quality and Singularity,” says Luc Gabriel, the brand’s president of The Different Company and co-founder of the young Comité Joséphine, a trade association focusing on the promotion of rare perfumes. Created by Thierry de Baschmakoff and produced by Pochet, the perfumes’ glass bottle stand out from the mass with its cover, a true symbol of the brand, which is made of silver finished metal (La Factory) or black Bakelite, depending on the collections. From the beginning, The Different Company chose to combine luxury with eco-design by offering a refillable 90 ml version. The also offers a chic nomadic spirit through its crocodile or lizard leather travel cases, and its 10 ml lightweight version. In addition to fragrances, a bath line and a collection of candles complete the range, which is available at the brand’s store in Paris but also in independent perfumery stores and some selected department stores in 35 countries. As many other niche perfumery brands The Different Company generates 80% of its turnover from exports. ""There is a huge interest in this category around the world,"" says Luc Gabriel  ""In the Gulf countries, Russia, Latin America and in the Baltic countries, where independent niche retail stores account for 15% of the market, the haute parfumerie is gradually replacing selective brands. We are also prospecting new markets such as Sweden and Mexico,"" he adds. With sales growing by 20%, in line with the estimated market growth, The Different Company maintains its market share in a competitive environment that has largely changed in recent years.  ""It is true that many alternative brands have been launched and this impacted us between 2008 and 2010. However, consumers are now returning to true quality. Actually, only fifteen marks are really interesting and have the financial capacity to invest in brand consistency and in the creativity of the fragrances and packs. Our positioning as contemporary French haute parfumerie brand is our main asset and originality,"" concludes Luc Gabriel."
The Body Shop plans to set up 500 stores in Brazil by 2019,"L’Oréal announced the entry of The Body Shop in Brazil in October 2013 with the acquisition of 51% of Emporio Body Store.  Although information on investment and product development in Brazil has not yet been disclosed entirely, at the end of 2014, when this article was written, The Body Shop brand was available in 130 points of sale, either Empório Body Store or The Body Shop outlets.  The company forecasts all Emporio Body Store retail stores to turn into The Body Shop in 2015 and has announced plans to expand the number of franchise stores from 122 to 500 in five years. ""The brand is being very well received and we are looking after the project with particular attention so as to continue with the solid relationship we’ve built with both the market and the consumers over our first months in Brazil,” says Tobias Chanan, founder of Body Emporio Store. When asked about speculations involving the opening of a The Body Shop plant in Brazil, Chanan says that ""at this stage, all products will be imported."" The Brazilian project can also be a great opportunity to expand the use of the country’s native raw materials by The Body Shop. Currently, the multinational partners with communities of local farmers, artisans and rural cooperatives in more than 20 countries, but only two of the ingredients are extracted from Brazilian soil - soybean oil and babassu oil - and the products made from these raw materials are not yet available in Brazil. Tobias Chanan started the Empório Body Store in 1997, with a store specialized in imported cosmetics at Shopping Iguatemi, in Porto Alegre. The operation was made possible by the favorable exchange rate and the popularity enjoyed by international products among Brazilian consumers in the 1990s. But it was only in 2001 that the brand gained its emporium character – inspired by a trip to California, Chanan decided to adopt a handmade concept for the manufacturing of the products, which still remains the company’s philosophy to this day. Ten years later, entrepreneur Helio Seibel saw the potential of Emporio Body Store and acquired 65% of the company, which allowed the installation of its own plant and the consolidation of the franchise model. With sales valued at R$ 20 million in 2012, Emporio Body Store became an attractive contender for acquisition by The Body Shop, which already operated in 60 countries around the world and was studying its entry into the Brazilian retail market. The Brazilian outlets join over 3,000 The Body Shop stores worldwide. Among its iconic products is the world’s first body butter, launched in 1992. According to company data, one tube of body butter is sold every two seconds. On the other hand, Emporio Body Store became known in Brazil for its bath and body care lines Lolita, Leite de Cabra (‘Goat Milk’) and Sakura No Ki. The English company Lush Cosmetics, which returned to Brazil in March, and the Australian Aesop brand, which opens its second store in São Paulo in January 2015, are expected to be The Body Shop’s main competitors in Brazil. Not coincidentally, the three brands share many values, including their support for fair trade initiatives and their campaign against animal testing."
La Prairie opens first flagship store in Paris,"Premium Beauty News - Laurent Marteau, Travel Retail Director recently told us that La Prairie grew by 6% last year, taking advantage of dynamic sales in Asia (+6%), Russia (+36%) and in travel retail (+10%). What about France? Laurent Leblond -  France is La Prairie’s first subsidiary in Europe, over 5 years, a higher growth than in other countries. We have grown our turnover by +25%, while decreasing the number of POS from 650 to 450.  Our products are among the most luxurious cosmetics in the world and the über-premium segment is doing well, the brand’s sales are increasing by +5% this year in skincare while the market is decreasing by -4%. [1] Premium Beauty News - Why opening this new prestigious store while you are in the process of reducing the number of POS? Laurent Leblond - Selective beauty retail chains have entered a sqm-profitability strategy that does not allow us to showcase our entire offer. We wanted a more controlled distribution in selected and geographically relevant outlets, including 80 independent perfumeries, department stores, hotel spas and our own flagship store, with all the freedom that comes with it. La Prairie needed to take the next step in terms of recognition. Showcasing our entire offer this space is the ultimate reference about the brand’s range, as well as about our services and supports. Some of our products, such as Caviar collection, are best sellers, but few consumers really know the variety of our offer. Thanks to an internationally popular location and a comprehensive assortment, we can reach a greater number of women of all ages and all nationalities. Premium Beauty News - Can you give more details about the new La Prairie outlet? Laurent Leblond - The entire place - 210 sqm and 3 levels - displays La Prairie’s colours: white and silver grey. The ground floor is dedicated to the sale. Our clients can enter the shop and discover La Prarie’s world through the ""Collection Wall"" featuring the brand’s entire skincare offer: the Platinum, Caviar, White Caviar, Radiance, Anti-Ageing, Cellular Swiss Ice Crystal, Cellular Power, Advanced Marine Biology, Cellular Hydrating collections. A total of more than a hundred references. The apartment upstairs, connected by a glass staircase, is dedicated to VIP and press reception. Customers are also welcomed for a personal check-up before entering the elegant 15sqm cabin. At the lower level there are two other cabins and a makeup area. Premium Beauty News - So you offer products for sale and skincare sessions in the same location. Laurent Leblond - There is a real demand for a La Prairie experience. In the new store, our customers can enjoy exclusive signature treatments. We will showcase everything that makes our quality and in turn we’ll surely learn a lot about our customers."
"“The cosmetics industry can be proud of what it represents,” Patrick O’Quin, FEBEA","Premium Beauty News – It has been just over six months since you took up your position. What image do you have of the cosmetics industry? Patrick O’Quin - I am impressed by how well this sector can renew and reinvent itself. If the French industry occupies this position in the world today, it is because it has never been under the illusion it had won the game. It has always known how to renew itself despite difficulties and changes in the market. If we have a look at the number of patents registered, the cosmetics industry is the second most innovative sector in France after the motor industry! It is a sector that managed not to stick stubbornly to tradition. On the contrary, it capitalized on its long history to make it a driver for progress. As a result, thanks to its image, its capacity to innovate, and the quality of its products, it is now a very competitive industry. We have extraordinary companies of all sizes! Premium Beauty News - How do you think the market is going to evolve? Patrick O’Quin -  From a general standpoint, the current situation of the French cosmetics market is rather disappointing, just as it is for any other sector. Even though we do not have definite statistics yet, we are expecting a slight decline in 2014 in France, and a stable market at best in Europe. However, the industry should keep growing thanks to the dynamism of non-European markets. Of course, China and Brazil are no longer as powerful drivers as they used to be, and exports to Russia have been disrupted due to the geopolitical situation and the fall in the rouble. But other markets are emerging, in particular in Africa. It is true that the impressive growth rates they show are not always significant given their initial weakness, but several countries have experienced a real economic development. The sky has definitely not cleared up yet, but it is not altogether dark. Premium Beauty News - How do you view discussions with the government? Patrick O’Quin - I am convinced that as a sector, the cosmetics industry should be more visible, and prouder of what it represents for France. It is far from the triviality it is often reduced to, and it is the 3rd export sector of the French balance of trade. It represents 42,000 direct jobs, and at least three times more indirect jobs. National decision-makers and political representatives are not aware of the importance of this sector for growth! And we are deeply concerned about the numerous decisions that are taken hastily, without a real dialogue or impact assessment, sometimes without any scientific basis, and which directly threaten whole areas of our industry. We must speak up again. My predecessor, Alain Grangé Cabane, had initiated a study on the image of the sector, its companies and products, and the results will be used as a basis to set up a strategy aiming to better highlight our industry’s assets. Premium Beauty News - What will be the great challenges for 2015? Patrick O’Quin - We have several issues of concern. First, all the themes related to health: allergens, endocrine disruptors. We want the safety of our products to be guaranteed, but rather on facts and scientific bases than emotional grounds. The second group of issues has to do with the evolution of regulations in the world, especially in China. Third concern: the denaturation of alcohol, and the questioning by the European Commission of the French system, which allows denaturation through the perfuming composition. To us, it is a key element in the quality and reputation of French perfumery. We have already evoked another important challenge, the implementation of a communication strategy. Lastly, I would add sectoral synergy to that list. The industry’s companies should form a united front. That is why we endeavour to strengthen our bonds and relationships with other entities, in particular the Cosmetic Valley, whose activities are really complementary of ours. Premium Beauty News - What about the TTIP agreement? Patrick O’Quin - Cosmetics represent an important part of the transatlantic partnership. [1] It is quite remarkable to see that in this sector, there are points on which manufacturers agree on both sides of the Atlantic, and we are supported by the European Commission. The objective is not to seek some kind of utopian harmonization, but to reach mutual recognition. Indeed, consumer safety is the main concern for regulations on both sides of the Atlantic, and it is well taken care of. Most operators in the cosmetics sector are present on both sides of the Atlantic, so this would make trade easier."
"Cosmax, investing and expanding its global presence","And that’s not all, Cosmax leaders have announced one after another: the setting up in Korea of a Research and Innovation Centre more specifically dedicated to packaging, the increase in the production capacity of their two Chinese factories, the extension (4,000 sqm) of one of the Korean factories, and to top it all the makeover of its internal organization with the creation of a Strategic Marketing oriented team and the restructuring of the group’s management (SAP). A series of investments that occur at a time when the Group will be posting for the year 2014, an increase of more than 30% of its consolidated turnover, which is expected to reach 600 million dollars. For Jay Kim, CEO of Cosmax International, ""our main areas of international development are clearly oriented for the coming months on the strengthening our presence in the U.S. and on supporting the significant growth in the skincare and make-up market in South-east Asia, especially in China (40% of our activity). This explains our continuous investments to strengthen both our financial and human resources in these two regions. As for Europe, we, of course, also intend to increase our presence, especially commercially speaking, knowing that eventually, as I already had an opportunity to say in your columns, an industrial presence is not excluded in the longer term"". The Korean company, which is positioned as a total outsourcing company in both the niche of skin care and make-up, stresses this year on the importance of the service that it is entitled to provide its customers with, in terms of packaging development but also applicators.  ""This is essential, explained Jay Kim, innovation and quality in formulas are all the more valorised when the packaging is adapted and if we take into account the way they should be applied. Our customers and, in particular, our key international customers are expecting this type of service from us."" Hence the opening this year in Korea, of the ""packaging"" dedicated Research and Innovation Centre which has all the necessary equipment. Besides Indonesia and the U.S. The group so far has three factories in Korea and two in China, and we were at the told headquarters that a fourth unit could soon see the light in Korea."
"Nail polish: “The Brazilian market is on the verge of transformation”, Cary Robinson, Keystone’s President and CEO","Premium Beauty News - How is evolving the nail polish market worldwide? Cary Robinson - The market growth is slowing, we no longer record the impressive double digit rates that we experienced a few years ago.  Novelties and special effects products are now driving the market and consumers are demanding better performing products.  I am convinced that the new chemistries and technologies are going to renew the interest in this market.  Gel polishes, for instance, already represent 15% of the US market and are one of the most dynamic categories in Europe. Our strategy is based on strong technological advances, highly reliable and qualitative industrial tools, breakthrough innovations combined with differentiated marketing offerings to support our clients. Premium Beauty News - Actually, you recently announced your intention to open new production facilities in Europe and Brazil. Cary Robinson - We export from the United States about 40% of our production, two-thirds of which go to Europe.  Russia, the Middle East, China and Brazil are also important markets with strong opportunities for growth.  In a market where speed to market is a key factor of success, it is important to have fill-in and logistics facilities closer to our customers.  However, 100% of our products are formulated in the USA. Premium Beauty News - A lot of suppliers of cosmetic and beauty products are currently investing in Brazil. Cary Robinson - As far as nail varnishes are concerned, Brazil is the world’s largest market in volume, while the United States are the leading market in value.  The Brazilian market cannot be ignored but barriers to trade are very prohibitive.  We are therefore identifying small Brazilian companies to buy and within the next 12 months will own a Brazilian company.  Our competitors are doing exactly the same. Since it was protected from foreign competitors, the nail polish market in Brazil had no pressure to evolve.  As a consequence the chemistry of these products has remained the same for 25 years.  The presence of new manufacturers, introducing new processes and chemistries will have a strong impact on the market. Brazilian brands will now have the opportunity to market different and innovative products.  Also, the quality of products will improve. Many consumers are ready to pay a bit more for products with a better quality.  We’ll not be another low cost producer in the Brazilian market."
 The Brazilian market to be the first to discover the new Clarins women’s perfume,"“Given the good results we have had with Azzaro Pour Homme, we have chosen to intensify our strategy over the next three years in Brazil, our most important market in Latin America”, explains Patricia Abergel, General Manager Latin America for the Clarins Group. To start with, the market’s star men’s fragrance was the focus of a large media campaign in 2014. New packaging, new TV film, new visual, new face with Ian Somerhalder (Vampire Diaries)… the brand has been occupying the various advertising, digital, and travel retail channels since last July. In May 2015, Azzaro Pour Elle, the women’s version, will be launched as a preview in Brazil. The new fragrance will be promoted through a TV campaign with Ana Beatriz Barros as its icon – the Brazilian model who already appeared in the TV campaign of the men’s version. Ultimately, in 2016, Brazilians will be able to discover a new Azzaro juice for men. Although they are mostly distributed through a selective network and on the Internet, the Clarins perfumes are gradually positioning themselves on the market: “our fragrances are doing well, Angel by Thierry Mugler is ranked 10 despite a limited presence”, Patricia Abergel explains. And the Source, the concept of bottles endlessly refillable from “two-head” fountains in store, most certainly has something to do with the success of the two lines concerned, Angel and Alien. “It is a concept we must absolutely promote, as it is Thierry Mugler’s DNA, by highlighting loyalty, service, ecology, and economy”, she says. Above all, the group pays close attention to its visibility. “Right now, we are enhancing our image and productivity, and then we will be seeking to develop distribution”, Abergel adds, although she specifies the group is not considering opening wholly-owned stores for now."
New ambitions for Manifesto,"A new management team, a new location in the heart of Paris, close to the Place de l’Opéra and the Place Vendôme, and plenty new projects! After a full restructuration, Manifesto unveiled last week its new business goals within the Superga group. While the creative and technical teams remained unchanged, the specialist of beauty cases, bags and textile accessories for the cosmetics industry now has a new sales team and a new Executive Director: Nathalie Duvoisin. ""The first step was to strengthen the company’s technical capacity and to consolidate its sourcing capacity. We have therefore settled two technical teams in China, one in Hong Kong and the other in Shenzhen,"" said Alain Bréau, president of Manifesto and of the Superga group. The aim is to perfectly control the quality of the production but also the commitments on environmental and social responsibility, which have become a prerequisite for most customers. The second step is to beef up the company’s international business, including the opening - by the month of January 2015 - of a sales subsidiary in the United States, in addition to the one opened in China in conjunction with the technical activities. These investments should support Alain Bréau’s goal to double the turnover of the company and to reach a turnover of 15 million euros by the next 18 months. The implementation of the new strategy has been entrusted to Nathalie Duvoisin who intends to rely on her knowledge of Asian sourcing to provide more innovation and expand the company’s range of products.  ""Manifesto should be at the state of the art of manufacturing techniques, to master new materials for the cases and bags - which form the heart of company’s offer – thanks to materials markets now well developed in Asia,"" she said. Regarding the extension of its offer, Manifesto might be interested in scented products (candles, scents, fragrance diffusers), textiles (t-shirts, sponges) and hard goods (jewellery and fancy containers). ""One of Manifesto’s weaknesses was precisely to be too focused on a single product category, to be locked in its specialty, we needed new products, innovation, and new ideas."" Together with Beauty Packaging Services (BPS), a co-packing company for cosmetics, Manifesto now forms the new Beauty division of the Superga group. By continuing to diversify its activities from the luxury sector to the beauty, Superga has created a platform of services offering its customers the possibility to couple sourcing, filling and logistics. ""We evaluate the gain to about one month during the development process,"" concludes Alain Bréau."
Caudalie to multiply openings in Brazil,"Premium Beauty News -  What is Caudalie’s strategy to enter the Brazilian market and set up there? Virginie Milosevic - Caudalie is developing through three main networks: our wholly-owned stores, our local e-commerce website, and the Sephora network. Premium Beauty News - You opened your first wholly-owned store in March 2013 in Iguatemi. Has the network developed since then?
 
Virginie Milosevic -  Today, Brazil counts three wholly-owned stores, and there will even be a fourth one soon, which is really unusual for our brand: one in  Sao Paulo (Iguatemi), one in Rio de Janeiro (Village Mall), a Spa boutique in Curitiba (Patio Batel), and another Spa boutique is to open in  Sao Paulo (Higienopolis) in November 2014. Brazil is in full swing, the beauty market is booming and in the process of structuring itself, so it is the right moment for us to invest. Premium Beauty News - Is the partnership with Sephora exclusive? Virginie Milosevic - Yes, Caudalie has been distributed through this network since May 2014, and the first months have been promising. Premium Beauty News - What are Caudalie’s assets on this market? Virginie Milosevic -  Our brand has a very strong identity. We’re very lucky! Our history is very original, our scientific innovations very promising, and our self-imposed ethical charter very demanding. In addition, we work a lot on the glamour of our brand with natural and efficient, but also ultra-feminine and attractive products. Premium Beauty News - Do Brazilian women know the brand? Virginie Milosevic - Caudalie still mainly aims to develop brand awareness in Brazil - we work on it on a daily basis. We target all women with different ranges to provide an answer to every desire and skin type, from the most sensitive to the most demanding.   Premium Beauty News - Do you intend to open spas? Virginie Milosevic - Our boutique in Curitiba has a wonderful spa cabin, just like the next one that is to open in  Sao Paulo. We are convinced we should offer our customers the possibility to discover and try our products via our Spa expertise. We have not concluded any partnership with any hotel yet, but we are reviewing the proposals we were made."
SIMP is settling in Mexico,"Quite an outstanding performance for this French SME, located in the Paris area, employing 32 people and specialized in the manufacture of cosmetic applicators, among which a host of mascara brushes. Taken over in July 2011 by its current managers, Alain Blondel and Eric de Bardonneche, supported by the investment fund Omnes Capital, its staff will have doubled in three years and its turnover increased by more than 50%. SIMP produced last year in its plant in the Paris region an all-time record of 100 million mascara brushes and more than 120 million rubber wipers! The winning formula: a new industrial organization to optimize production to its maximum, maximum automation of the different production stations, a will to fully control the entire production chain, including in particular the manufacture of moulds and rely on strong innovation to be able to produce out of the ordinary shapes. ""We can design a pilot mould in five weeks, and a production mould in eight to nine weeks,"" says Blondel. One of the French company’s other strong point, according to its leader, is its ability to develop innovative products and more specifically, to reinvent the cosmetic applicator, and this, at competitive prices. All this of course backed up by patents... no less than seven patents were filed since the takeover of the company. ""This clearly can be attributed to the industrial model that we implemented, combined with our ability to master both the design and manufacture of our moulds upstream"". ""The start of this factory in Mexico,  explains Blondel, is the natural outcome of our success abroad and of our commitment to support our clients wherever they develop their businesses."" Hence, the French company is settling in Mexico in the city of Aguascalientes, in a 1,500 sqm factory, and will start first by producing what is also one of its main assets in Europe, rubber wipers. By mid 2016, the Mexican plant will be able to produce about 30 million of them per year.  ""This is an important step in our development on the North and South American continents. The recent MakeUp in New York trade show, to which we took part, was an indicator of our growth potential across the Atlantic. Our presence at MakeUp in São Paulo also illustrates this,"" explains Alain Blondel. ""That is what is at stake,” we were told at SIMP. “Even though the mascara plastic brush remains one of our featured products, enabling us to claim a 25% global market share, we are focusing a lot on other types of applicators, especially gloss applicators but also applications outside the cosmetic field, like for example for health-related products or various industrial applications."" To note that this ""extra cosmetic"" activity, this year will account for nearly 30% of the company’s turnover."
Beautypress convinces cosmetic brands,"Premium Beauty News - What differentiates your services from those of a traditional press agency? Gabriele Fuchs - A PR agency - or an in-house team - takes care of the PR strategy, the budget, the press releases and press conferences and has to be in personal touch with a selected number of media and editors. So a lot of personal involvement and creativity is required to do this. While we as a digital service take over the below the line activities as archiving the press releases and the images of standard and new products and wiring out newsletters to get the attention of the press. With our very widespread editor contacts and the possibility to measure for each brand their individual media list we maximize the outreach. Being digital all product information and images are available at any time for an instant download and publication. This availability is our great advantage. Furthermore, our database is fully searchable through multiple ways. Our goal to support the PR teams to get more publications. Premium Beauty News - You opened your French service in 2011. How did it evolve?  Gabriele Fuchs - We started mainly with brands that knew our services already from the German or US market, like Procter & Gamble, Lavera or Santé Naturkosmetik, but in the meantime more and more French brands followed. Premium Beauty News - How many brands are working with you now?  Gabriele Fuchs - We are working with more than 150 brands in France and we developed very strongly in the past three years. What helped us to grow is a second service that we offer: our multi-brand events, where we offer brands a face-to-face time with beauty editors. With reaching the break even point last year the French team can be very proud of their achievement. Premium Beauty News - What is the typical portray of a brand using your services?  Gabriele Fuchs -  Actually, there is not a typical brand. Among our clients are global players, niche brands, natural cosmetics, luxury and mass market brands. That was our intention right from the start. Editors look into all different kinds of brands and we want to offer a complete overview of the market, not just a ""glimpse"" of it. Premium Beauty News - And in the US?  Gabriele Fuchs - This is a much more difficult market due to the distance that we have and the sheer size of it. But after 5 years we are a recognized service. Growing each year at a 30% rate is a success after the disastrous economic depression of 2009 and the 2 following years. Premium Beauty News - What will be your next developments? Gabriele Fuchs - We are looking into new markets to launch the concept as we see how much interest we get from international brands offering our services now in eight countries. Clients support us to move forward and to support them on more markets.  This is based on their experience how efficient and cost saving our service is."
Strong growth for Crystal Claire Cosmetics,"Together under Crystal Group, owned by CEO Roger Hwang, Crystal Claire Cosmetics and its sister company,Crystal International (est. 1992) have seen a remarkable performance growth in both sales and new clients over the last few years. This year’s expected sales for Crystal Group are estimated at 135 million US dollars with a total staff of more than 2,000 people worldwide. Crystal Claire Cosmetics’ Canadian production facility is fully dedicated to providing Full Turnkey Services ranging from product/package design to final product delivery, including in-house formulations, and manufacturing and packing of cosmetic products. Crystal International Inc., in its own right, has become a leading global packaging supplier with several production units located throughout China, offering customized cosmetic packaging from initial concepts, design prototypes, to finished components. The company specializes in Plastic Injection Moulding, Dual Dispensing Systems and Airless packages. “Innovation and Quality is a top priority at Crystal Claire Cosmetics”, explains Rhonda Beveridge, Vice President of Product Development & Marketing. “As the demands of the marketplace evolve, it is crucial to be a step ahead to introduce unique, high performing quality formulations to our clients. Our research team is always in search for the latest advances in ingredients, processes and technology. Our knowledgeable experienced chemists understand the importance of developing high performance formulations using the best ingredients. Some of the categories that we specialize in are Powders: Loose, Pressed, Baked and our most recent advanced Élite Slurry Technology, but also Lipsticks, Lip glosses, Lip Balms, Foundations, Primers,  Mascaras, Liquid Eye Liners, and Skin / Body Products. We have our own formulations to offer and an extensive shade range, or we can custom develop a formula for a brand”. The customer base of the Toronto firm perfectly characterizes its progress. ""Clearly,” emphasises Beveridge, “this structure mainly consists of large international groups for whom we have become one of the main partners in North America these past years."" The market operations of Crystal Claire Cosmetics remain concentrated at 90% in North and South America with European operations growing rapidly. So much so, that the opening of a wholly owned subsidiary in Paris, France could happen in the very near future of Crystal Group. ""More than mere suppliers, we truly position ourselves as generators of ideas and creators,” insists Beveridge. “Our efforts to develop new textures are constant, our R&D team works vigorously on developing new textures that will perform and exceed consumer expectations."""
The Brazilian factory of the Geka group will be operational in the first half of 2015,"Premium Beauty News - Within thirty months, your group has undergone significant changes! Amaury de Menthière - I will recall a few facts. In early 2012, the international investment fund 3i entered into an agreement to take a majority stake in Geka’s capital. Founded in 1925, this German company is a pioneer company in the field of plastic injection moulding for mascara brushes and packaging. Geka has production facilities in Bechhofen, Germany and in Elgin, Illinois, and has sales offices in Paris and New York. We employ approximately 800 people worldwide and this year the company’s turnover will be on the rise. We can consider that we have in the field of mascara a global market share of around 30%. Premium Beauty News -  What key decisions were taken in recent months? Amaury de Menthière - We started by launching a few months ago a ""supply chain"" plan to shorten our delivery times and reduce our minimum order quantity (MOQ) to 25 000 pieces to better meet the requirements of our customers. And the least we can say is that this operation was a success, since we are about to achieve a customer satisfaction rating never reached before. Second decision, take advantage of the company’s technological expertise to diversify its activities towards health care and applicators in a field that encompasses not only skincare but also pharmacy and, to some extent, the medical sector. This was achieved as it is now a separate activity. Third decision, an effective industrial presence in Brazil. Premium Beauty News - Brazil, an important issue? Amaury de Menthière - Jérôme de Prémare, the Group’s Sales & Marketing SVP, had already stressed on this point in your columns a few months ago. If our objective is to strengthen the development of the Group’s activities both in Europe and the United States, we also want to set foot in new markets in Asia and South America, particularly in China and Brazil. After the successful creation of a business structure in Sao Paulo, we made some plans to build a factory of its own. This will soon be achieved. It will be located in the outskirts of Sao Paulo. The first injection and assembly machines are actually on their way to the site. This factory will help address projects that are already under way, not only concerning mascara but also lipgloss and eyeliners. But that’s not all! I remind you that our trading subsidiary Victoria (specialised in cosmetic brushes and accessories) is opening some offices in Hong Kong and Shanghai to import products in Europe and the US. A structure that only reflects what the next steps of our development in Asia will be. Premium Beauty News - The American factory has also been revamped? Amaury de Menthière -  That’s right, our factory in Elgin, Illinois, has fully integrated, since this year, the ""injection"" part, which was previously outsourced. Premium Beauty News - A group in working order? Amaury de Menthière - Absolutely! All the more since both the sales and technical teams have been reinforced and we continue to build on innovation. This has always been in the company’s DNA and we are pursuing this strategy more than ever. On average we file between five to ten patents a year and the goal is clearly to expand our product portfolio in the field of system applicators. The Geka Group is and will remain a leading and unavoidable player in this market segment."
"Dear Rose, Chantal and Alexandra Roos’s ode to women and perfume","Premium Beauty News - What made you decide to embark on this common adventure? Chantal Roos -  Strangely enough, I had never had in mind to create my own brand, it is Alexandra who gave me the impulse. It is true it is much more interesting, but it is also an opportunity to create where there is actually something missing. At the moment, consumers’ real longing for a more precious world is felt particularly strongly, as well as their need for perfumery to lie at the core of emotions. It was the right moment. Alexandra Roos - It is also related to passing down my mother’s knowledge of this trade. It felt obvious. I am an artist first, and my world is that of music, but of course I have always been surrounded by perfumery. We decided to match both, as they are not such different worlds. We talk about notes, composition… the writing process is quite similar in music and perfumery. Musical references are never far in the creative part of the brand, such as the perfume names or the bottle designs. Premium Beauty News - Can you talk about Dear Rose? Chantal Roos -  Dear Rose celebrates the eternal story of women and perfume, it is an ode to femininity. ‘Rose’ reminds of the name, but especially of the flower: if only one flower were to be remembered in the perfume, it would be the rose. It embodies the perfume. Nevertheless, not all our perfumes contain rose. Fabrice Pellegrin, the perfumer, immersed himself in our story and composed the five fragrances – A Capella, the sound of a pure voice, a fresh green, I Love My Man, for women in love with love, Bloody Rose, Sympathy For The Sun, which is very sensual on bare skin, and La Favorite. Alexandra Roos - The bottle is very feminine, with quite a heavy glass weight for an easy grab, and adorned with copper, a material that is both organic and precious. Premium Beauty News - This line was launched last May and distributed by the Différentes Latitudes label. What about your future projects? Alexandra Roos - Indeed, the collection has been launched with success, and a new one is scheduled before the end of the year. Now apart from France, we are already present in Germany, Austria, Benelux, the Baltic states, we are starting at Harrod’s in October, and we have contacts in the United States. Our online store is also accessible."
"Dr. Jörg Karas, new Managing Director of Schwan Cosmetics: “People, Profit and Planet”","Premium Beauty News - Which positions did you previously hold before your appointment to Managing Director of Schwan Cosmetics? Jörg Karas -  I started at Schwan Cosmetics as one of the department managers in Production and was subsequently responsible for different, partly international areas within Operations. Six years ago I was appointed to the Executive Committee and have since been Head of R&D. After these very interesting and successful years leading this group I am looking forward to the new challenges ahead. I am certain that Schwan Cosmetics will further set standards within the industry when it comes to innovation and client orientation and will continue to strengthen its leading position in Service and Operations. Premium Beauty News - Where do you see the challenges in your new position? Which goals and objectives are you setting for yourself and what do you specifically want to „tackle“? Jörg Karas - First and foremost it is imperative to secure and pursue the current positive economic development. Sustainability is part of our DNA and not only a trendy expression for us. We have initiated a few major projects in all three dimensions – People, Profit and Planet. The harmony of these three aspects is ultimately what will make companies successful for the long‐term future. In addition we will put more emphasis onto our global production network ‐ especially in the growth markets. Premium Beauty News - What is your vision for the company? Jörg Karas - So far Schwan Cosmetics’ strategy has been a very successful one and subsequently offers an excellent framework for the future development. However it will no longer be sufficient in this industry to set the standards in product and service only. Successful companies will re‐invent themselves in shorter cycles and thus adapt to quickly changing market and client requirements. My vision: a dynamic organization for sustainable success – for our customers as well as for Schwan Cosmetics."

"Hwa Sung, make-up innovation at the heart of the strategy","It may be recalled that Hwa Sung specialized in the production of pencils and plastic applicators in the early 1980s to actually begin its series of ""two and three in one"" in 2004. Today it also offers, along with formulas, multi-compartment make-up cases and closures, combined or single lipgloss and mascaras... On the industrial side, the Korean company owns a factory in the outskirts of Seoul, employs 100 people and will achieve this year a turnover of 34.5 million U.S. dollars (compared to the 20 million posted n 2012!). Hwa Sung has operations mainly in Korea (60% of its business), but continues to increase its penetration in the US, which represents 80 per cent of its export sales, and is now targeting Europe. On the side of recent launches in which the company was involved: – for Anastasia Beverly Hills, an eyebrow pencil with a super slim Brush, and a diameter of 1.6 but yet a hard moulded texture. The fine pencil tip mimics the appearance of tiny hairs. – as for Stila, this innovative waterproof brush pen applicator, can help define natural looking brows, its felt tip guarantees an easy smudge- and crease-proof application that stays on all day. – for smashbox is a triangular eye brow pencil with a gel to define a full coloured or thin line. The coloured or clear brow gel is perfect to set eyebrow hairs. – Finally, for Korea’s Aritaum, this slim lipstick with its smudge tip will be perfect to blend the formula while achieving colour gradients on the lips."
"“The potential of beauty boxes is far from being exhausted”, Charles von Abercron, founder and CEO of Glossybox","Premium Beauty News - In three years, Glossybox globally emerged as one of the main actors of the beauty box concept. What is your assessment at this stage? Charles von Abercron - Every 12 seconds we sell a new box. We are really proud of these facts. We are represented in ten countries and three continents. It is highly interesting to see how the beauty industry works in other countries, which habits, or which products are more likely to be appreciated by German, American or Swedish customers. What is also very important is our surveys. This is how we know that our customers’ favorite product in ALL countries is Mascara. We have also recently learned, according to a survey, that French women among others, are the ones that value being tanned the most. Premium Beauty News - How to explain the Glossybox success story? Charles von Abercron - It is the love of detail that makes our success, and makes the difference. Therefore, our Mantra is “It’s not done until it is perfect”. We want our customers to have the best experience and reach their expectations. The use of Big Data on the one hand, and our beauty expertise on the other, ensure that the composition of the box is appreciated and brings joy to the user. The fact that we use Big Data makes our company unique. Our goal is to know our customers better than they know themselves. To this aim, Big Data is essential to us. Trying to surprise customers by sending products they will like without knowing them is somehow the secret of Glossybox’s success story. We take also advantage of the fact that we are an international company. So brand awareness can be developed in several countries at the same time. In Sweden, for instance, it worked out really well and really fast. Premium Beauty News - Is the Beauty Box phenomenon still so trendy? Charles von Abercron - When I just take a look at the figures, I have the feeling that the potential of beauty boxes is far from being exhausted.  In an era of mass consumption, where everybody has everything, we need to convince people by using other marketing tools, such as emotionalizing. This is where we take our advantage. Customers want to be surprised, and to discover products they do not know, but which suit their needs. The unboxing experience reaches that goal. Premium Beauty News - What are your projects of development? Charles von Abercron -  Our current project is to increase customer satisfaction and enthusiasm, which is working very well already: within 6/six months, we managed to improve our customer satisfaction from 68 to 84 %. We expect to reach 90%. This is why we are launching a new version of our Glossybox for our third anniversary. We really hope it is going to please customers and make the unboxing moment even more exciting. The design of the box is the result of common/joint work with our customers. Premium Beauty News - Do you also plan to open stores like your competitor? Charles von Abercron -  This might happen in the future, and we have already had a few first tests with the opening of pop up stores in Sweden and in the US. It is a completely different experience for the customer.  However, for the moment we are devoted to the ultimate customer unboxing experience."
"HCP, contemplates possibility in setting up industrial presence in Europe","Premium Beauty News - The start of your aluminium-processing plant and of your fourth plastic injection factory barely completed in China, 2015 also promises to be a ""rich year» in investments and acquisitions? Eddy Wu -  Indeed, thanks to the support of our financial sponsor, TPG Capital, who is stating our common ambition to continue to work towards positioning HCP Packaging as a leading player in the beauty packaging industry in the world, we are looking forward to strengthening our presence in the coming months. With industrial investments, of course, but with the right kind of investment too. In China for example, our fourth plant ideally reflects the new industrial face of HCP. It is, as you know, a unit where all the production flows have been optimized to the maximum in order to not only increase our global competitiveness but also to strongly improve the quality of our production. At a competitive level, it can be estimated that this factory employs, an equivalent level of production considered, almost 50% people less than a conventional factory. As you know China has to face the challenges generated by the expansion of its economy, which must be associated with the natural increase in wages. ""China = cheap labour"" is a concept doomed to fall into oblivion in the medium-term. In term of quality, the challenges that we are taking up in the area of automation and of improvement of industrial flows allows us in addition to reach always higher levels of quality. Premium Beauty News - Your investment decisions in terms of production capacity differ depending on the regions where you operate? Eddy Wu - That’s true. If in China we are continuing to invest in terms of volumes and quality, like for example with our plastic injection capacity but also with our production capacity of moulds (+ 30% next year) and in metallization/varnishing, the goal for the USA and Mexico is not necessarily to increase our capacity. What matters most in this region, it is our reactivity to customer requirements and the industrial proximity we offer the whole North American continent. This is also what will drive us to establish ourselves industrially in Eastern Europe. An operation, which is scheduled for the time being and according to our plans, next year. Premium Beauty News - And commercially, what parts of the world do you favour most? Eddy Wu -  As usual, of course, the United States, Europe and China, but also other areas where finally our expertise and the quality of our productions are increasingly recognized, like for example and surprisingly, Japan (The Kose group has awarded us for the second consecutive year a prize for the excellence in our work). Brazil is obviously a country we are watching closely too."
Make-up: Sleever is gaining momentum!,"Premium Beauty News - What have been the changes since its launch in 2010? Eric Fresnel -  After a first year focused on pencils, a second on polishes and then lipsticks, and presently mascaras, Sleever International, the leader of the sleeve concept, offers comprehensive solutions in terms of, protection at the source of the make-up product, of traceability (QR Code, C133-type Datamatrix, laser number marking, transfer coding), of design and brand customization: an exact reproduction of the lipstick shade, a palette of special effects, the use of bright, pearlescent or iridescent technical polishes, a sharpness of printed details, the ability to produce miniseries for consumer testing. To achieve this, Sleever International has developed a new film, the C-PET-KG-050 with improved cosmetic properties (facilitated tearability, low temperature, dressing of complex shapes) and through its design ability (printability, transparency, brightness). Premium Beauty News - Industrialization is an additional constraint to cope with, for the development of the SleeverMakeup® range! Eric Fresnel -  We have developed a new device with an advanced technology, the “SleeverLogicpak® LPK 80” machine, which complements the range of SleeverLogicpak equipment and which is perfectly suited for the sleeve positioning and horizontal shrinkage of small packagings (pencils, lipsticks, mascaras, creams nail polishes...).

Makeup innovations: BCM relies on its French-German synergy,"Two is better than one! BCM relies on its French and German-based branches to meet the needs of the makeup industry. If the French entity is more specialized in coloured emulsions (foundation, eyeliners, mascaras, etc.), the German entity is more of a powder and lip product expert, although it can produce all categories of makeup, except for pencils, and it is even equipped for nail varnish filling. The third entity is based in the UK, and is specialized in skincare. Amongst the innovations showcased at the last edition of the MakeUp in Paris trade show held at the Carrousel du Louvre last June 12 and 13, 2014, the Boots group’s subsidiary specialized in cosmetics subcontracting highlighted its latest powder innovations. The Germany-based BCM plant recently invested in new powder technologies, such as the multidimensional 3D technology, and thus expanded the product range to extremely varied and sophisticated renderings and designs (flat effects combined with 3D rounded, satin and pearly effects on the surface and in mass). “This technology provides an excellent payoff. It’s the next generation of powders,” emphasizes Marie-Christine Clerc, Sales and Marketing Director of the French BCM entity. In addition, BCM showcased two Cream to Powder emulsions, a blush [blush poupoupidou] and a foundation [effect & matte foundation SPF15] with extremely thin textures that provide a high coverage, and melt on the skin for a light, “second skin effect” makeup. But above all, the company launched a novel Powder to Cream formula: when applied, this free powder transforms itself into a real melting cream with a playful metamorphosis effect and surprising sensations, like a cooling aqua effect. It is available as a blush [powder to cream blusher], a foundation [powder to cream foundation], or even an eyeshadow [powder to cream eyeshadow]. As for emulsions, BCM’s French entity has followed the “cushion” trend that is booming in Asia, and especially Korea, by developing ultra-fluid textures to be applied with a double sponge. The principle is simple: an “inker” sponge receives the product, and an “applicator” sponge takes the dose required for the application. Even the most fluid formulas remain easy to apply and use, including when retouching during the day. BCM showcased two formulas to combine care and pleasure, protection and colour, light and efficacy, a regular application and convenience, and thus meet the specific needs of European consumers: – [Mist Cushion SPF 15], a foundation that is as fluid as ink, which makes its coverage adjustable,
– [Primer mist cushion SPF 30], a primer endowed with a high sun protection factor, a makeup/skincare/sun care hybrid with a steady blur effect that captures the sunlight while protecting from its rays. “BCM has always adopted a skincare approach in makeup. The fact that we develop products destined to be marketed through the pharmacy network for Boots undoubtedly guided our approach to makeup,” Marie-Christine Clerc explains. A new wave has also been sweeping the stick segment for a few seasons, and BCM is definitely riding it, for instance with [hip hop hair stick], a coloured stick destined for hair, with short-lived but very playful effects, and other sticks for a fresh effect on the complexion: [cooling blush] and [cooling highlighter] are formulated with a very high water percentage, so that the colour is applied without any “material effect” that would mark wrinkles and fine lines."
Birchbox leverages its concept through a first store in New York,"Located in SoHo, at 433 West Broadway, in lower Manhattan in New York City, the very new Birchbox store features 2,000 products from 250 brands including Smashbox, Caudalie, Jouer, Supergoop!, Cynthia Rowley, Baxter of California, Lab Series, and Art of Shaving. The store concept leverages the insights and feedback gathered from the company’s more than 800,000 active subscribers: editorial content, videos and product reviews throughout the shop to help customers learn and self-navigate, touchscreens on display throughout the store to help customers to source product recommendations, and testers available for every product in the store. A vertical merchandising strategy allows consumers to shop by category instead of by brand. For example, a shopper could come in looking for a red lipstick and compare different types in the ‘makeup’ section of the store. The store also features a “Try Bar” where customers can experiment with different beauty trends and find the products that are right for them.  Also, for a personalised experience, a dedicated B.Y.O.B. (standing for “Build Your Own Birchbox”) section allows shoppers to hand-pick five sample size products of their choice for 15 USD.  A good way for the retailer to recruit new members of the Birchbox community… There are different beauty services available by appointment (and for walk-ins when available) for hair, nails and makeup, as well as group classes on a variety of topics. Classes are designed to appeal to all types of beauty consumers and allow them to sample, try and learn about the products. Classes will be free for Birchbox subscribers and $30 for non-subscribers. “Our goal with Birchbox has always been to make it easy, efficient and fun for people to discover new brands and products fit for their lifestyle,” said Katia Beauchamp, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Birchbox. “We have learned so much about how we can drive customers to change their behaviour online, and we see an opportunity to extend into offline retail to evolve with our customer’s needs.” Launched in 2010 in the U.S., Birchbox sends every month a selection of sample size beauty and grooming products, adapted to the profile of its subscribers who provided information about their skin and hair conditions.  In April 2012, the company launched Birchbox Man in the U.S. and in September 2012, Birchbox acquired France-based company JolieBox, thus gaining outposts in France, Spain and the UK.  Additionally, through Birchbox’s online store, customers can shop full-sized products from more than 800 brands.  With the opening of the SoHo store, this omni-channel retail concept is certainly one of the most well-conceived to date. “Birchbox is well-positioned to understand omni-channel beauty given its start as an ecommerce company, and learnings gained from a series of successful pop-up shops throughout the years. The Birchbox store is another channel to help create a robust shopping experience, allowing Birchbox to engage with consumers through multiple touch points - from commerce to content to trial - and further bring it’s 360 retail experience of ‘try, learn, buy’ to life,” the company explains."
Fiabila announces the start of its second filling unit in Japan,"Premium Beauty News - This acceleration in your investments in major theatres of operation in the Beauty industry around the world is quite impressive! Pierre Miasnik - I don’t know if it’s impressive but it was necessary. We must be able to meet the needs of brand owners in all the areas of the world where they operate. This responsiveness, industrially speaking, is of course important but it’s not enough. What matters the most, and especially in Japan, is to comply with deadlines and regulations, security of supply and, above all, offer an impeccable level of quality. Quality and security are and always have been key criteria for us. Our business has evolved significantly in recent years. We never stop adapting each day. I have already emphasised in your newsletter, but this is now a leitmotiv: the more our customers concentrate, the more their requirements increase in fields as diverse as the reduction of the environmental impact, the carbon footprint of offered products, ethical and quality considerations. They have become so strategic and vital that we are compelled to set up teams capable of mastering these areas. Premium Beauty News - There is no better example, indeed, in terms of quality requirements than Japan? Pierre Miasnik - We have been carrying out conditioning activities in this country since 2000 under the leadership of our partner Akira Hara. Undoubtedly those who can claim handling flammable products in Japan, where authorizations are scarce, automatically acquire a true legitimacy in terms of quality. I even surprise myself when I visit this country, to see, in our own production sites the quality level we have reached. This is in fact the whole meaning of my message in this announcement on the doubling of our production capacity locally that I have wished to pass on today. This second Japanese plant, extending over 1,300m² of premises on a plot of 6,000m² with its three filling lines and a storage capacity for flammables products of 20 tonnes is clearly designed to strengthen our capacity in Japan and for Japan. This industrial complex was designed with all the necessary precautions in terms of geographical location and complies with the Continuous Business Planning concept in the event of climatic or seismic damages. Premium Beauty News - This strategy also reinforces, of course, your presence in Asia?  Pierre Miasnik -  That’s right! As you recall, we commissioned over there, a short time ago, our first filling line in China with our partner Shya Hsin and we are gaining momentum in India. But Japan is at the same time a country in full evolution. Japanese women, currently, very fond of nail polishes in the form of gels, after several setbacks, are increasingly turning to traditional polishes again. The market is growing again. Where we are fortunate enough to be present and recognized."
Makeup and skincare innovation: the Alkos Group launches surprising textures,"The Cosmopack and MakeUp in Paris trade shows, which took place respectively in early April in Bologna, and last June 12 and 13 in Paris, represented another opportunity for the Alkos Group to highlight its expertise in lip and complexion product formulation, in particular by capitalizing on its Alkos Cosmétiques subsidiary’s expertise in plastic pencil formulas. On the lip segment, the French manufacturer launched the Matte & Long Lasting Veil, a new matte texture in a plastic jumbo pencil. When applied, the pencil leaves a real, long-lasting, and no transfer coloured veil with a matte finish on the lips which cannot be felt at all when touching the skin. “We have incorporated hydrating, anti-aging skincare actives into it for smooth, perfect lips,” specifies Florence Lefeuvre, the Commercial, Marketing and Communication Director of the group. In addition to this jumbo, Alkos has developed an automatic plastic pencil for the lip contour: the Matte & Smooth Definition. “Its smoothing formula fills in fine lines for a perfect contour, and its velvety finish suits both matte and more satin-like lipsticks.”  The same formula is also available in a wooden slim pencil. Also in the lip segment, the Alkos Group has developed Lift & Comfort, a new lipstick texture. It is no longer about the matte world here, as red has got a more intense and satin-like texture. Alkos claims a good adhesion, a very comfortable, long-lasting thin film, as well as lifting, toning and hydrating actives. “Makeup can no longer be efficient only in terms of colour, it must also provide a skincare benefit,” Florence Lefeuvre emphasizes. Formulated for cheeks and lips with a light, flexible texture and natural skincare actives such as mango and apricot butter, the Jumbo Twist Cheeks N’Lips is specific in that it leaves a shiny finish on lips, and a velvety finish on cheeks. Alkos also showcased several new formulas only for complexion, in particular in the form of sticks: – Perfect Complexion, a compact cream-to-powder, smoothing and corrective foundation formula with average coverage which does not mark dry areas, for a natural, flawless result.
– Lift N’Stay Concealer, a long-lasting, anti-dark circle formula available as a plastic jumbo or jumbo retractable pencil containing lifting, filling and blurring agents for a radiant, relaxed look.
– Soft Cream Blush Stick, a blush mini-stick with a melting texture, easy to apply and soften, and thus ultra-flexible, for a natural or sophisticated result.
– Terracotta Stick, long-lasting summer makeup to even and matify the complexion,
– Foundation Stick SPF 10, for a powdered effect: an intermediate between foundation and powder. Lastly, the Alkos Group developed two skincare products as part of a partnership with applicator supplier Cosmogen: – Instant Wake Up Serum, a lifting, decongestant serum in Cosmogen Squeeze’n Pentaball applicator packaging. The formula is to be applied before makeup for a fresher look. It also suits men’s needs.
– Eye Perfector Serum, an anti-wrinkle, anti-dark circle gel with an applicator from Cosmogen’s Tense range destined to make the formula penetrate more easily. “We offer them both as ready-to-go, full service formulas so that they can be placed on the market extremely fast. Of course, they can be delivered in other types of packaging, but then the time periods for performing tests have to be taken into account,” Florence Lefeuvre concludes."
"“We have to carefully watch the competitiveness of the European cosmetics industry”, Bertil Heerink, Cosmetics Europe","Premium Beauty News - The latest market figures published by Cosmetics Europe show that sales of European cosmetic products have been stable in 2013 despite the difficult economic context, in particular thanks to the dynamism of exportations. Bertil Heerink - Exports out of Europe have increased in 2013 and that was very good news considering the overall economic context and the value of the euro.  That made us convinced that the quality of European cosmetics is still very much in demand all over the world. Despite the lack of dynamism of the European market, we can be quite proud of the performance of our industry in 2013.  However, we have to be cautious, as a too expansive euro can be a risk. We have to watch the European competitiveness very carefully. Premium Beauty News - Do you see current negotiations on a EU-US free trade agreement as a way to support this competitiveness or as a risk? Bertil Heerink - It is good news!  Actually, the representatives of the cosmetics industry on both sides of the Atlantic have developed joint proposals in order to simplify trade between the two zones.  Few industries have gone as far as us.  Removing unnecessary technical impediments will ease the transatlantic business.  However, I want to stress the fact that our goal is not to lower the standards but to progress in the way of mutual recognition while keeping the same level of protection for consumers. Premium Beauty News - As far as cosmetics are concerned, the U.S. and European regulation widely differ. Do you think it would really be possible to harmonise them? Bertil Heerink -  It is not our goal.  For instance, I do not believe that the definition of products will be harmonised.  The European definition is much wider than the US one.  Nevertheless, there are several areas where progress is possible, in particular regarding testing procedures and technical requirements. For instance, good manufacturing practices (GMP) for cosmetics makers could be harmonised based on an ISO standard.  Testing requirements for the determination of the level of protection against UV rays and the Sun Protection Factors (SPF) could also be harmonised. We can also progress in the harmonisation of labelling requirements. In particular, divergences regarding the labelling of colour additives could be overcome.  The more we can do in the way of regulatory alignment, the easier it will be for companies to adapt to local requirements. Premium Beauty News - What about animal testing? It has been banned in Europe but is still permitted in the US. Bertil Heerink - The European Union has been a pioneer in this field and animal rights NGOs strongly pressure policy makers in the US, Canada, Japan or Brazil to follow our path.  As far as the European industry is concerned, our goal is to accelerate the validation of alternative methods and their acceptation by regulators worldwide.  We also have to harmonise the different approaches of the animal testing ban in order to avoid unnecessary technical barriers to trade and unfair competition. Premium Beauty News - How to achieve regulatory alignment without cutting back on consumer protection? Bertil Heerink - We have to prepare ourselves to fresh thinking on how we can use free trade agreements not only to ease business and trade, but also to increase the level of consumer protection globally.  The European Commission’s DG Health & Consumers has been very clear on this issue: progress in the way of regulatory harmonisation cannot be done through lower standards. The industry fully agrees with this approach. Premium Beauty News - What are your other priorities? Bertil Heerink - I would mention self-regulation, communication and China. Self-regulation is a strategic issue, in particular as far as claims and advertising practices are concerned.  It is the best way to protect consumers efficiently while guaranteeing enough freedom for innovation and competition.  We want to set up a process where we can learn from each other in the common interests of both consumers and the industry.  Our goal is that the principle of self-regulation, after discussion with consumers’ organisations, be accepted globally in the field of advertising. We should also coordinate our communication about the products.  Information is global now and when there is a safety concern in a major market it can quickly spread all over the world. Eventually, China remains a priority to us.  The country is in the process of building a new regulatory corpus for cosmetic products and we are cooperating a lot with Chinese authorities to avoid unnecessary barriers to trade while improving the level of consumer protection."
ABC Texture: Ten years already!,"Premium Beauty News - ABC Texture will be celebrating this year, its tenth anniversary! Louisette Bourdin -  That’s right! In 2004, after more than 20 years of R&D in cosmetics and several experiences in the creation of labs for industry subcontractors, I decided to start my own business with the creation of ABC Texture, a Research and Development Company in cosmetics.
It all started in Saint-Malo in a small of 20 sqm laboratory, with a formulation technician. First specialised in the development of new textures, I decided to expand very quickly the expertise of ABC Texture by offering my clients to produce their products. Premium Beauty News - 2008 is a pivotal year in your development? Louisette Bourdin - It is indeed the year when we decided to invest EUR 1 million in the construction of a new site in Dinard, just minutes from Saint-Malo. This new eco-designed 850 sqm industrial building was built in compliance with the High Environmental Quality (HQE) standards. Committed to listening to the market and our clients, the machine park at the time was evolving to meet demands for small and large series. The team then consisted of 6 people for a turnover of EUR 0.4 million, including more than 40% from exports. The following year, the company closed the year with a turnover of EUR 1.2 million. I must stress on the fact that this success was based on listening and supporting our clients, with an extensive range of ready to launch formulas (sun care, make-up and skincare) and the development of tailor-made solutions. Premium Beauty News - Several novelties will be launched this year! Louisette Bourdin - Today, ABC Texture is a team of 18 people for a turnover of EUR 2.3 million, implementing a growth strategy in France and abroad. Our ambitions are clear: accelerate innovation and increase our international presence. To achieve these goals, we hired two new executives:
– Tifenn Boutard, doctor of pharmacy and physics, who joined us in December 2013 as Research Director.
– Nathalie Dessirier, joined the team as Exports, Sales and Marketing Director. Present on many trade shows (Seoul, Dubai, Paris, New York, Hong Kong), we are launching this year several new products to meet the needs of different markets. What these novelties have in common is that they are all formulated without silicone: – A matte long-wear Lipstick, with no volatile compounds. It delivers a pure and intense colour after just one application, exceptional comfort and glide thanks to an ultra-thin film on the lips. Enriched with vitamin E and F, it won’t run during the day.
– A Primer with an amazing formula that changes upon application; first a gel-cream for a cocooning skin feel, it quickly changes into a powdery veil for a flawless complexion.
– A range of compact concealers containing hydrophilic actives acting on effects like dark circles. Silicone-free, it provides a fresh skin feel and reinforces hydration upon application. A SPF15 concealer also complements the range."
"“Design is the primary component in brand development,” Dominic Bakic","Premium Beauty News - The DieterBakic Group is well known for its innovative and unconventional designs. Dominic Bakic - Historically we are a design agency and a strategically oriented packaging supplier, specializing in high-end stock packaging, but we grow to become much more!  We see design as a primary component in brand development.  The brand’s positioning and strategy is the keystone of our creative process. We explore the nature of brands we are working with, in order to define unique identities and strengthen the relationship with important target groups. Our aim is that packaging fully contributes to the brand personality.  Our diversified services range from stock packaging to custom design, and from concepts to all-inclusive solutions. Since we also work on the brand’s image and positioning, what we offer goes far beyond full-service and usual turnkey products. Now, many of the projects we are working on are based on branding. For our customers the main benefits are that they get access to a fully integrated process and not only get concepts to market but also and immediately the partner that can execute those concepts.  In addition, when we start working on a brand concept, we start very early to think about what is needed to promote and advertise the new products successfully; hence looking at all touchpoints and initiating successful campaigns. Premium Beauty News - Can you provide us with an illustration of such a project? Dominic Bakic - Of course!  One of our most recent projects consisted in the development of the brand identity of Wunderbar, a line of professional hair care products launched by Pro Duo, a subsidiary of Sally Beauty Holdings.  The group wanted to strengthen their footprint in the professional hair care market in European. We helped them to develop the entire brand concept, starting from scratch. The only thing that existed was the name of the brand and a short description of its target positioning.  Our services included the creation of the brand story, packaging design, logo optimization, colour code, as well as the art direction of the communication campaign (concept and realization of the photoshooting, brochures, sales-folder, POS advertisements, etc.) Premium Beauty News - Innovation is the key factor of success in such a business. How do you handle this task? Dominic Bakic -  Actually, we handle the first stages of innovation through a quite unstructured approach. We collect ideas and packaging worldwide, we visit many tradeshows and retail shops, not only those related to the cosmetics business but also in sectors such as foods or leather goods.  I’m convinced that cross-fertilization is key to true innovation. Premium Beauty News - What are your main challenges and forecasts for the current year? Dominic Bakic - Today, we work on projects that go beyond the mere packaging aspect and that contain higher levels of complexity compared to what we have dealt with in the past. This required setting-up new internal procedures and ways of working! So far, we have been quite successful in selling this complexity to the market and we achieved a good growth over the last two years and are expected to continue that growth in 2014. Our ability to create and strengthen the brand’s image, from the design of its packaging to the point of sale is our strongest asset.  A product must be successful at every step: at the point of sale, it must attract and convince the consumer, and during its usage at home, it must produce enough consumer satisfaction to induce repurchases."
Industry: A new President for the FEBEA,"He is a new face at the head of the FEBEA, the main trade federation representing the companies manufacturing and marketing cosmetic products in France: on July 1, 2014, Patrice O’Quin will succeed Alain Grangé-Cabane, who had been managing the organisation for 16 years. “I’m convinced trade organizations play a major role in today’s complex societies. They have a double mission: expressing companies’ needs to politicians and government officials, and explaining the constraints of public services to companies. Besides, a Federation has a double duty towards its members: on the one hand, it represents them collectively before public authorities or the various “stakeholders” (the scientific community, NGOs, the media…), and on the other hand it provides its members with personalized services (regulations, social issues, exports…) for them to develop their activity in the best conditions,” explains the future President. A former student at the prestigious French college ENA, which trains future top civil servants, Patrice O’Quin started his professional life in the public administration before joining the business world at Danone, where he was the Director of External Relations and Government Affairs for a little over ten years. “I saw the cosmetics industry profoundly transform itself. First, it got globalized, and then it found a way to adapt to new society requirements: the environment, safety, and ethics. Rules and standards gradually became much stricter, but our manufacturers managed to anticipate regulations by implementing ‘good practices’. We were thus able to renew and revive our contract of confidence with our customers. As I’m convinced Patrick will know how to make our Federation reach new heights, I can only wish him to be as happy as I was as the President of the FEBEA,” declared Alain Grangé-Cabane, who was elected Honorary President, and who will sit as such on the Federation’s Board of Directors. Portrait: Patrick O’Quin Patrick O’Quin is now 59 and has a double experience in public life and the business world. He studied at the prestigious French college ENA, and after getting a diploma in Political Science, he was first appointed senior civil servant at the French Ministry of Agriculture. Then he worked as a Technical Advisor at the Office of the Minister of European Affairs from 1984 to 1986. For the following nine years, Patrick O’Quin held various international positions at the Ministries of Foreign Affairs or Cooperation, in particular as the Advisor of the Chad Republic’s Minister of Finance (in N’Djamena). In 1995, Patrick O’Quin decided to stop working for the public administration and join the business world, first as the Director of Environmental Relations at Brasseries Kronenbourg. In 1998, he was called to work at the Danone group headquarters, first as the Director of Corporate External Relations, then as the Director of Government and Multilateral Affairs, as from 2010. He has also had to deal with Danone’s relations with various non-business partners of the group as part of his recent duties (public institutions, regulatory authorities, scientific bodies, professional federations, non-governmental organisations, consumer movements)."
"The prestigious Ellis Island Medal of Honor is awarded to Charles Chang, Topline","Born in 1949 in China, Charles Chang grew up in Taiwan. At age 22, he came to America as an international student at the University of Mississippi where he received an MS degree in Chemical Engineering. He continued his studies at Rutgers University, earning an MS in Packaging Science and Engineering, and later obtained an MBA from Farleigh Dickinson University in 1978 and an APC in Marketing from NYU in 1979. Before he started Topline in 1982, he gained corporate experience at Lever Brothers, Avon and Airwick Industries. Since founding Topline, Mr. Chang has transformed his company from an importing business to a vertically integrated manufacturing operation that is emerging as one of the global leaders in the cosmetic packaging industry. Topline has its headquarters in New Jersey and more than 1,000 employees, operates factories worldwide in China, U.S., and Mexico. Additional corporate offices are located in Paris, San Paulo and Shanghai. Under Mr. Chang’s leadership, Topline has grown at a 30 percent annual compounding rate from 2001 to 2008 and was ranked as one of New Jersey’s top 50 fastest growing companies for five years in a row. “I came to America 43 years ago as an international student. I studied, worked and build a business. In between, I got married and raised a family. There have been many people who have played important roles in my life. They lend a hand, helped and supported me along the way. I do feel that I am a truly blessed person for so many good things that happened to me,” said Chang during the ceremony. The National Ethnic Coalition (NECO) was founded in 1986 and is the awarding body of the Ellis Island Medals of Honor. The Medal embodies the spirit of America in celebration of patriotism, tolerance, brotherhood and diversity. This event seeks to single out high profile individuals who have made it their mission to share with those less fortunate their wealth of knowledge, indomitable courage, boundless compassion, unique talents and selfless generosity; all while maintaining the traditions of their ethnic heritage as they uphold the ideals and spirit of America.  NECO remains dedicated to the maintenance and restoration of America’s greatest symbol of its immigrant history, Ellis Island. As the Medal is based on merit, there are no ‘winners’, only recipients who are recognized for their contributions to America. Its recipients included six US presidents, Mohammad Ali, Bob Hope, Joe DiMaggio, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump. Last year it honoured Hubert Guerrand-Hermes and Xavier Guerrand-Hermes as International Award recipients. From the cosmetic industry, Leonard and Evelyn Lauder were also among the recipients. “From his earliest days in the cosmetics industry as a packaging engineer and later as president of Topline Products, Mr. Chang has distinguished himself as a forward-thinking, long-range visionary”, stated the communiqué.  “He was a pioneer in introducing packaging solutions from the Orient to North America and among the first to combine that manufacturing with filled cosmetics made in China. These two achievements have made Topline unique in the beauty industry: the company stands apart as a supplier of complete turnkey solutions for customers. Mr. Chang is also recognized as a creative innovator, obtaining more than 30 utility patents worldwide. Persistent in finding solutions to problems when others typically give up, he lives by his own motto - ‘No Way. No Way.’ (There is no way that there is no way.) But this dynamic attitude is balanced by his genuine concern and compassion for others, always lending a hand to help - ‘a businessman with a heart’ as one of his colleagues described him.” Mr. Chang was inducted into the prestigious Packaging Hall of Fame in 2007 by the New Jersey Packaging Executives Club - an honour only given at the senior level to executives who have made a major contribution to the industry. He also received the distinguished Asian Business Leadership Award in 2009 from the U.S. Pan Asian American Chamber of Commerce (USPAACC) and Wells Fargo Bank. He founded and is chairman of Rutgers Packaging Engineering Advisory Board, a member of Industry Advisory Board of the School of Engineering at Rutgers University, and also a member of Board Overseers at the Rutgers Foundation. This year, in addition to Charles Chang and Yue-Sai Kan, the other personalities singled out were FOX Business Network Anchor and Global Markets Editor Maria Bartiromo, hit reality series So You Think You can Dance creator and celebrity judge Nigel Lythgoe, Heavyweight Champion of the World Evander Holyfield, Ambassador David Thorne, Chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs Rep.

Nicolas Geiger - We have about 100 L’Occitane en Provence sales outlets throughout the whole territory, both wholly owned stores and franchises. Then there are 30 sales outlets for L’Occitane au Brésil; the first store was opened one year ago. This brand is mainly present in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte, but it is spreading fast. Shopping mall managers have got to know us better, and they like us. Of course we do have good arguments, and our best store achieved a 25 % sales increase in 2013. Premium Beauty News - How would you describe the Brazilian market? Nicolas Geiger - Exciting and dynamic, but also complex because it is very closed and competitive. On the one hand, the Brazilian tax system results in huge additional costs for imported products. On the other hand, the market is very concentrated, with large groups such as Natura, Avon or Boticario. Just to give you an idea, the O Boticario brand alone counts about 3,600 sales outlets. So to succeed and make oneself a place among local players, one has to have a real offer to make. Our 19-year experience is a tremendous asset from this standpoint. We have learned a lot, including from past mistakes. In order to keep developing, it seemed crucial to us to produce on a local basis; hence the launching of the brand L’Occitane au Brésil. This was not achieved without any difficulty, especially to find an industrial partner that corresponded to our quality requirements, and who would accept to produce in our current quantities for costs that remained competitive. Anyway, with a 20 % growth in 2013, we are the fastest-growing market in the group. Brazil is currently the 6th or 7th market for L’Occitane, and we aim to make it first. Therefore the next step will be the opening of a research and development laboratory in Brazil. Premium Beauty News - What are your strengths on this market? Nicolas Geiger - Here in Brazil, L’Occitane is traditionally viewed as a toiletries and perfume brand. For instance, our more premium eau de toilette line La Collection de Grasse has experienced a great success, and so has the Cherry Blossom fragrance derived from the “classic” line, with only one ingredient highlighted. But our Divine face care cream is also very popular around here: it is part of our Top 5 in terms of sales. However, our strength is more about the story told by our products. We invest a lot in training to transmit and make people share the love of tradition and of the ingredients we use. Brazilian consumers also like the traceability of these ingredients. Premium Beauty News - Didn’t founding L’Occitane au Brésil have an impact on the sales of L’Occitane en Provence? Nicolas Geiger - There is a small loss in market share, but these brands do not exactly target the same consumers. L’Occitane en Provence aims at women of 35 and over, whereas “au Brésil” targets the 25 and over."
Yves Rocher to open 10 stores in Brazil by the end of 2014,"Premium Beauty News - What are your assets and ambitions for this market? Arnaud Williart - Brazil is the 3rd largest cosmetic market in the world, and it has a tremendous potential, so we had to be there too. It undoubtedly has a very strong inclination toward Cosmétique Végétale®, so since Yves Rocher actives are derived from the botanical world, and their efficacy is claimed by science, our brand has everything it needs to succeed there. Besides, our Brazilian signature is “O poder das plantas. A Certeza da ciència”: the power of plants sublimated by science. This market should be approached with both humility and determination. This year, we first intend to open about ten stores in large cities such as Sᾶo Paulo and Rio, depending on the opportunities for good locations. We also launched our e-store website on May 1st to cover the whole country’s territory: www.yvesrocherfrance.com.br Premium Beauty News - Will they be wholly owned stores? Arnaud Williart - We are already present over there, not via a subsidiary, but through a distribution partner. We do intend to start with wholly owned stores, but given the craze for franchises in this country, they will also be a way for us to develop once our model has been validated. Premium Beauty News - Is the brand already known to Brazilian consumers? Arnaud Williart - The Yves Rocher brand has already made itself a name in Brazil, especially to travelling Brazilians. Some of them already know exactly what they want. Premium Beauty News - Are products made in Brazil? Arnaud Williart - For the moment we stick to an export model, but of course, depending how things go, we have no rule against a local production with industrial partners, starting with heavy products to be transported, in order to reduce the environmental impact. Our decision will be determined by our capacity to have enough volume and set up a local production for reasonable costs. We will sort this out over the next one or two years, I guess. Premium Beauty News - So do prices get higher? Arnaud Williart -  Brazil’s customs protectionism makes the product registration procedure pretty heavy and costly, which does also make products more expensive. Unfortunately, we do have to pass an increase in logistics costs and import taxes on to the customer, but we endeavour to minimize this impact and keep products easily available. Premium Beauty News - Which specificities are taken into account when selecting the products? Arnaud Williart - In the hygiene category, it has to be noted that the market is towards soap rather than shower gels; that is a first point. As for perfumery, Brazil is the country of body mist, so we have put an emphasis on ranges such as the very floral and fresh “Un Matin au Jardin”. We are also thinking about developing a specific body mist range. In the segment of skincare, we favour lighter textures to meet the needs of combination and oily skins, which represent a vast majority in this country. This approach is actually backed up by the first results of the UV Beauty Shield, which combines a light texture and an SPF 50 protection. We are arriving in Brazil with the core of our catalogue, that is, 530 references, including the make-up shades. The first feedback from the Morumbi shopping mall in Sao Paulo is pretty good, with our perfumes proving really popular. Premium Beauty News - Do you have a supply chain for raw materials in Brazil? Arnaud Williart -  Yves Rocher is supplied by cooperatives and associations in the State of Pará through its Brazilian supply partner, and also supports the organization, training, economic development, and therefore empowerment of local communities. We purchase several materials in Brazil, including organic Andiroba, which is used for instance in a dry oil, such as in our Riche Crème, now a cult product. The Yves Rocher Laboratories have also selected the organic Andiroba nut oil, a true botanical treasure from the Amazon basin. Premium Beauty News - Where will the next stores be opened? Arnaud Williart -  We are opening a second store in Sao Paulo in the next few days at the Center Norte shopping mall, and a third one will be inaugurated in early June in Rio."
Aircos: new textures,"Premium Beauty News - As far as Full Service is concerned, you are obviously well positioned? Frédéric Lancesseur -  At Aircos, our mission is to offer innovative, customized solutions through our formulation laboratories and, of course, our specialized sites (make-up and injection). From the designing of the pack to the formula including production, our teams can offer a truly full-service make-up range. A solution that oversimplifies the supply chain, reduces development times and offers competitive ’Made in France’ products. Don’t forget that to complement our formulation offer and propose an innovative technological solution, we have developed a specific back injection process called “IPM”, from our expertise in plastic injection and make-up formulation. This process allows for the development of new generation formulas combined with surface effects, while maintaining the best in each ingredient. Premium Beauty News  A lot of novelties are planned at our stand at MakeUp in Paris? Thomas Sirot -  Yes. We have, for the past 3 years, placed innovation at the centre of our development strategy.
At the forthcoming MakeUp in Paris on 12 & 13 June next, we will showcase a powder range for a flawless complexion (the Blur range), a new futuristic eyeshadow effect (the Holographic Glitter), a 3-in-1 metal product (the Glossy Metal), and a 3D volume effect to dramatically highlight textures. As for the Blur range, it is a range of loose or compact powders that makes it possible to optically correct skin irregularities. The formula fills in the skin reliefs while reflecting the light from the small hollow of the epidermis in order to illuminate these shadowy areas. As a result, the skin texture looks smoother, pores are tightened and blurred out, small scars are less visible, wrinkles and fine lines are reduced. With Glossy Metal, the metallic trend of podiums is revisited with a multifunctional product. Obtained with the “IPM” technology, it is an ultra-creamy texture with an intense and thin film as of the first application. It is truly a fashion accessory! On eyelids it can be used as a halo, a contour or as an up or under liner. It can also be used on lips or eyebrows. Its promise: a very good hold, which does not require an airtight pack. As for our product, Holographic Glitter, it provides a true futuristic effect to give a 3D effect to the eyelid thanks to its holographic glitters. Its creamy, melting texture, obtained with our “IPM” technology, enables to achieve an ultra glittery eye shadow with a long hold. Finally, to highlight a featured product or create an animation, again with our “IPM” technology, we offer impressive volume effects (half sphere) with very fine details. A plastic grid can also be used to create logos or give specific geometric shapes."
Barcelona creates its Beauty Cluster,"The official launch of the Barcelona Beauty Cluster took place on May 12 in the headquarters of Acció, the agency for the development of Catalan companies. The beauty industry in Catalonia represents about 350 companies (53% of the companies from this sector in Spain) and 4.2 billion euros and 18,000 staffs. The establishment of the cluster is the result of two years of joint analysis and reflection between the industry and the Catalan government, which kick-started this project in 2012.  The cluster currently gathers 13 founding members specialising in formulation, filling, brand strategy, packaging and retail - Eurofragance, Carinsa, Ainea Perfums, MartiDerm, Genocosmetics, Bella Aurora Labs, Fit4Ever, Camacho Cosmètics, Laurendor, Teknics, Quadpack Group, CosmeticInMind and BlueMandarine - that account for a turnover of over 145 million and 700 employees. ""Spain ranks fifth among the EU27 producers in the beauty industry, with a market valued at over 7 billion euros. Catalonia yields over half of that, with its high concentration of businesses in the sector. So this is a very active part of the world and we saw an opportunity to set up a cluster, to work together for mutual benefit,"" explains Gloria Prats, cluster manager at Acció. Just like its French alter ego - the Chartres headquartered Cosmetic Valley - the cluster aims to gather the companies of the sector’s entire value chain: raw material suppliers, packaging companies, fillers, and manufacturers, etc. The cluster’s mission is to exchange knowledge, encourage partnership and promote its members’ products within Spain and beyond. “The cluster’s mission is to create an area of commercial cooperation between member companies, with the aim to launch new, creative and innovative projects,"" says Josep Maria Martinez Ribes, CEO of Bella Aurora Labs and president of the Barcelona Beauty Cluster. “There is so much energy and enthusiasm here and our number is sure to grow. Through grouping companies in the same value chain, we will be able to exploit synergies and learn from each other,"" comments Quadpack CEO Tim Eaves."
Private Cosmetics to develop niche brands in Brazil,"Brazil Beauty News - How do you proceed? Claude Requena - I’ve been working for a year with my Brazilian partner, Cristiane Vilar, to distribute cosmetic products, make-up lines, nail varnish and perfume ranges around Brazil. We have selected about 20 to 22 brands, including 13 niche perfume brands such as Ann Gérard, Teo Cabanel, Comptoir Sud Pacifique, Mark Buxton, Frapin and Micaleff, which originate from the European and American markets, but also brands from the segments of skincare, like Alorée or Gentlemen’s Tonic, and make-up or nail varnish (NCLa), which we have been importing into Brazil since April. Brazil Beauty News - How will these brands be distributed? Claude Requena -  Mainly on the big retailer channel, for example through Onofre, one of the main Brazilian retailers. Onofre originates from the pharmacy world and represents a network of about 3,000 sales outlets in Brazil. They have been developing greatly on the beauty market, and also own five megastores in Sᾶo Paulo today, which involves about 1,000 customers a day, and a monthly turnover of almost one million euros. Three other megastores are scheduled to open by the end of the year. They have come to realize there is a significant demand for this type of products, and very few players to meet it. They have found our initiative interesting, so they offered us specific spaces for our various niche brands. We are also launching a very top-of-the-range designed website, cosmopolitandobrasil.com.br, which will soon be operational. Lastly, we are thinking about opening our own sales outlets over the next one or two years, and we are developing our contact network to reach new thresholds. Besides, we have been working on other distribution concepts. Brazil Beauty News - What makes the Brazilian market interesting for niche brands? Claude Requena - There is a real expectation, as can be seen with the demands formulated on our brands’ websites. This market is a completely virgin territory, although we are talking about the largest fragrance market in the world. There are 200 million people in Brazil, and the number of people with a high purchasing power is increasing, even outside Sᾶo Paulo and Brasília. That’s why it’s important to be able to offer them this type of products. They are huge niche brand consumers when they are in France. For instance the Alorée brand, which is part of our selection, has observed Brazilians represent a large part of their customers at Sephora in Paris. As for perfumery, it is just the same. Many high-income Brazilians buy their perfumes in Miami to avoid paying any taxes, but the niche perfume brands they like to buy in Paris are not available there. We are the main importers – not to say the only ones! – of niche perfumes to offer a certain category of Brazilians the possibility to get them easily in their own country. Brazil Beauty News - What advantages do you offer these brands? Claude Requena - Easiness. It is almost impossible to develop in Brazil without a local partner. It can take a very long time before being able to register one’s products. And administrative services tend to tighten things and to increasingly practice protectionism. This is going to be very hard for foreign brands to enter this market. My partner is an importer based in Brasília, where the ANVISA has its headquarters. It makes things much simpler with registration issues, which are relatively important in Brazil. There can be many differences between what is written in legal texts and the reality. It’s very complicated. Brazil Beauty News - As for perfumes, what type of fragrances do you tend to choose? Claude Requena - We usually select rather floral, fruity, light and fresh scents. For example there is the new Molinard range, or Ann Gérard, whose new fragrance is just pure bliss, and there is also Comptoir Sud Pacifique’s latest range, with light ouds which have nothing to do with the strong, lingering fragrances that can be found for the Middle East. We aim at working with rather high-end brands, and though the packaging, concept and textures play an important role, the first thing is to have a brand that provides all the documents needed for registration… and which has a lot of patience. All our partner brands have shown they do. Brazil Beauty News - What are your objectives? Claude Requena - In terms of development, we intend to be present in several big chain stores, with very specific spaces, but also to open our own sales outlets as from 2015-2016, with our own name. These will be specialized in the field of niche perfumery, with a real high-end concept. Development depends on São Paolo and Brasília first. And only then will we have a look at Rio, because although it stands as Brazil’s iconic city, it is not where business is done. We prefer to remain very sensible in terms of volume predictions: a turnover of €5 million over the next three years seems conceivable to us, though I think it can go much faster."
HCP ramps up its production capacity in China,"Premium Beauty News - With 4,000 employees, more than $ 200 million in revenue, five plants (three in China, one in the United States and one in Mexico), HCP is a beautiful machine, with operations in the packaging, make–up, skin-care and perfume sectors, and whose main asset remains innovation. You have announced a new industrial expansion in China. A mean to significantly increase your industrial capacity? Eddy Wu - Absolutely. We can speak of a double digit increase rate. Plans are to add 50 injection moulding machines and 10 metallisation and painting lines during an upgrade that will also allow expansion of lean manufacturing programmes. The new expansion will not only give us additional space to expand our capacity but also, maybe more importantly, provide more flexibility for HCP to implement various lean manufacturing production which tends to be more difficult to realize in a traditional packaging factory. Premium Beauty News - A few words about the new aluminium processing unit! Eddy Wu - Yes, we now have at our disposal a new aluminium processing plant which currently employs 200 people and which is located near our existing plant in Huai’an. It covers an area 27,000 sqm (300,000 sq ft). The building itself covers 11,500 sqm (124,000 sq ft). All the moulds are made on site. The plant can produce around 200 million pieces per year and of course is equipped with several automatic and semi-automatic anodizing lines. Premium Beauty News - In parallel, environmental protection is constantly on the agenda? Eddy Wu - We are working hard to reduce carbon footprint through environmental programmes. We use renewable energy sources to produce heat in order to support manufacturing processes and install solar panels and wind turbines in the grounds of the factories to generate electricity. Premium Beauty News - Innovation remains one of your watch words! Eddy Wu - You remember that we have set up a ""Innovation Committee"" in which the senior management of the company meets every month to discuss of the proposed innovation, decide on priorities between different ideas and ensure that the ones selected receive the necessary resources for their implementation. This includes both ideas on new designs and on new features. Premium Beauty News - You have focused in particular on material ""effects""? Eddy Wu - We all have a secret urge to ditch civilisation for a quiet cabin in the woods somewhere. Maybe a plot of land with some plants and flowers and a river running through it too, or at least a babbling brook. And trees everywhere, towering overhead, leaving just enough room to stargaze. These fantasies have inspired our R & D team to bring a little bit of nature back to packaging, with a “natural wood effect” and some spectacular “water effects”. The first one uses real wood pulp mixed with PP base material to create a wonderfully textured and natural grain finish that looks every bit like the real thing. And about the “Water effects”, we use two different methods, 3-D Droplets and Gelology. 3-D Droplets are formed by a unique manufacturing spray process that creates a droplet effect over metallization leaving a tactile and extremely realistic finish. The aspect an appearance of 3-D Droplets can be controlled to meet specific customer requirements. Great visual effects have been created using “Gelology” technology with graphics created by us to give a dramatic “bubbles” effect. Premium Beauty News - Are your ambitions in terms of industrial growth in the rest of the world still relevant? Eddy Wu -  More than ever! We are working very hard to establish a present in Eastern Europe in the mid-term and potentially in South America as well in the longer term."
Alkos and Cosmogen: Two entities in the same holding,"Founded in 1982 by Gérard Gieux, the Cosmogen company has gradually specialized in high-end packagings for cosmetic products, with as main clients, leading names in luxury cosmetics. In 1998, Gérard Gieux acquired one of his customers, Alkos Cosmetics (cosmetics pencils), and set foot in the formulation market along with the production of cosmetic products. In 2008, with the help of financial investors (Bpi France and NCI gestion), he took over two companies – Intercosmétiques and Sagal (make-up, skincare and hygiene) – that became part of the Alkos Group umbrella. After having successfully developed the two groups in parallel, with operations in France, USA, Brazil and China, Gieux decided to organize his operational succession while keeping a minority stake in the capital and taking the Chair of the Supervisory Board. ""The new strategic plan,  the statement details, is mainly based on organic growth, new product developments and international expansion. But acquisitions are not excluded however, to strengthen this organic strategy enabling to expand the product range or complete establishments abroad. The shareholders’ aim being to increase the turnover from 64 million euros to 100 million euros in the 5 year to come."" ""A few weeks before the kick-off of MakeUp in Paris,  explains Vautier, the turnover of Alkos will have increased by more than 16% in 2013 over the previous year, and prospects for 2014 look very good."" A 2013 year that saw the arrival of new production lines for lipsticks, plastic cosmetic pencils and eyeliners and the complete renovation of the production line for soaps.  ""This year,  he adds, we will continue to invest in plastic pencils and the conditioning of cleansing products."" Vautier also recalls that ""this excellent performance is due to the 3 million euros that have been injected in the past two years in the Alkos Group and to the work carried out to improve the industrial performance, but also, of course, to the work undertaken to reorganize the sales and marketing departments around the three poles of the Group. A particularly wide product offer covering skincare, pencils, make-up (except powders and polishes), soaps and perfumed deo sticks."" To note, on the occasion of the upcoming MakeUp in Paris, the presentation of industrialized innovations, such as, among others: – A new lip stick, ""Lift & Comfort Lipstick""; the new perfectly balanced great classic,
– A novel fluid lip texture ""Fluid Color Sensation"", with a subtle satin film
– A full service skincare ""Instant Perfector Eye Zone"" in the innovative packaging, Cosmogen Tense,
– The latest generation in the success story of Alkos plastic pencils textures in an Eye Liner version ""Liquidlike EL"", with a ""Wow! "" sensation!"
New ambitions for the Arthes Group,"Already the owner of one of the largest fragrance production plants in southern France (75 maceration tanks, 7 fully automated filling lines for a capacity of 120,000 bottles per day), the Arthes Group has invested nearly one million euros for the construction of a cosmetic formulation laboratory and for the opening of a cosmetic workshop for its skincare products. Investments took place over nearly a two-year period. Priority was given to the opening of the R&D lab, which is operational since September 2013 and enables the group to achieve its own formulas for skincare products and toiletries (shower gels, body lotions, creams, face, hand creams, etc.). The second step concerned the creation of a cosmetics workshop complying with GMP standards. The company opted for a clean room, with a gowning room for operators, an air tunnel at the entrance to prevent contamination, and a water osmosis unit for the entire conditioning process. Operational from May 2014, the new room is equipped with a 1000 litres reactor for the mixing of raw materials, a 500 litres boiler to facilitate the use of fatty materials, an industrial laundry for the disinfection of utensils, a hot and a cold group to vary the temperature of the water, a reverse osmosis (900 litres/hour) and a 4000 litres water reserve - to constantly have water osmosis available and finally of a filling line. So far solely focused on the production of perfumery products, the Arthes Group now has its own in-house equipments for the formulation and packaging of skin care products. Investments that follow the successful launch of the Jeanne en Provence brand, two years ago. Just one short year after its launch, this line of perfume waters, toilette waters, body care products, and home fragrances intended for the mass market, was present on the store shelves of 300 outlets in France, with specific wood displays set up in the beauty section, and was exported to Japan, South Africa, Algeria, Australia, Belgium, Ecuador, Finland, Paraguay and Tunisia. The success of the Jeanne en Provence brand is emblematic of the strategic realignment of the company, who celebrated its 35th anniversary in July 2013. “First intended for the production of low-price, made in France perfumes for export markets, ten years later, the Arthes Group decided to set foot in supermarkets in France,” explained Aude Genesté-Barera, Marketing Director. “In addition, since 2011, the Private Label division of Arthes serves the needs of fashion and retail brands seeking to make their own perfumes,” she added. Today, this - constantly growing - activity represents about 15% of the group’s turnover. In 2013, the Arthes Group’s private label division achieved, among others, the launch of a fragrance for one the leading drugstore chain in Germany, and the development of candles and home fragrances for a famous French home decoration retailer. Eventually, the group’s strategy - which employs around 100 people and is present in a hundred countries and 3,000 outlets in France - seems to be a winning one, with a sales increase of 11% in France in 2013, and significant market share gains in mass perfumery, despite a difficult market environment. In 2013, while total sales of mass market fragrances declined by -0.2% in France, Jeanne Arthes grew by 9%. The global turnover, meanwhile, has remained stable despite the difficulties of south-European markets in which Jeanne Arthes is very present."
Fiabila opens a factory in Brazil and increases its investment in the United States and France,"It’s official, Fiabila, the French manufacturer of nail polish, has acquired a factory in Brazil of more than 7,300 sqm on the outskirts of Sao Paulo, close to the international airport. “Production start-up is scheduled in three phases,” explained Pierre Miasnik, CEO. “As of next July, tinting processes will be operational. The implementation of packaging lines and then the manufacture of bases will follow in the following weeks and months.” An important milestone for the French company considering that this region is the second largest market behind the U.S., in terms of nail polish consumption. ""Which doesn’t stop us, from continuing our investments in France and in other parts of the world,"" highlighted Pierre Miasnik. In the United States first, where the French Group, who already owns two plants, has recently taken possession of a new building to house its packaging lines and which will be operational by the end of this year. In France too, where the Group, as part of a proactive environmental policy, has just spend the tidy sum of twelve million euros for the extension of the Maintenon site. Storage tanks with a total capacity of 450,000 litres were installed for the distribution of solvents and polymers replacing for the latter, a former supply system relying on 200 litre barrels.  “This means much more efficient, secure and clean logistics, explains Pierre Miasnik, which makes it possible to source our polymers using road tankers, to fully automate transfers carried out in a closed circuit to limit the release of VOCs [1] in the atmosphere. All VOCs will be captured at the point of emission and oxidation–treated before there are released in the atmosphere. An environmental effort, accompanied by a number of other decisions, like for example, the use of raw materials of plant origin.” The company, which will be present at Cosmoprof, will take the opportunity to present its new website. ""A website, insists Pierre Miasnik, that will reflect what our daily work is made of, namely an ongoing quest for creativity and quality."""
Luxcos: more than 25 new mascara formulas in April,"Luxcos was founded in 2003 to diversify the IL Cosmetics group’s product offer. The company is specialized in the manufacturing of mascara, liquid eyeliners and lipgloss for European customers mainly. It is focused on two areas of activity: bulk sales, and the full service offer in partnership with Interpack, the conditioning unit of IL Cosmetics. Since it was founded, Luxcos has kept on developing, and has achieved a two-digit yearly growth on average over the past few years. The 2014 turnover should reach about 10 million euros. “The first investments were focused on the R&D department, to which we dedicated 20 % of our personnel. Two innovation areas are destined for the development of new formulas and the optimization of the packaging/formula combination. Product performances are indeed closely linked with the effective interaction between the various elements within the system. This is particularly true for mascaras, but also for eyeliners and lipgloss”, underlines Christophe Delas, Director of Luxcos. Efforts and investments in R&D materialized in 2013 with the granting of a first patent for colour intensity enhancing agents in mascaras. Two new patents are already planned to be registered this year, including one next month. “As for mascaras, customer requests mainly focus on ‘volume + additional effect’, just like for 80 % of market claims,” explains Christophe Delas. “They also concern quick transfer to eyelashes, hence the importance of the research work done by our packaging engineer on optimum combinations. Besides, we have organized collaborative work – without any exclusive contract - with most European packaging suppliers in order to offer a wide range of possibilities to our customers.” However, Luxcos also develops other types of formulas, such as wet-effect formulas, or others which are adapted to specific make-up removal methods (such as water make-up removal at 38° C). “As for waterproof mascaras, which represent 15 to 20 % of the market, we have gained a real competitive advantage on all the effects sought after: volume, longlash, curl, multiple effects or all-in-one,” he adds. In order to adapt its developments to market evolutions, Luxcos also invests in the understanding of customer needs, in particular through the organisation of panels representing the various types of eyelashes (Caucasian, African, Asian, depending on the particular needs of the developments). “We aim to offer a whole range of formulas and formula-packaging combinations which can meet all types of customer expectations, since women’s eyelashes and make-up rituals are all extremely different. We have indeed found out there is no perfect mascara likely to suit all consumers alike, which undoubtedly explains the multiple, diversified brand offer. These conclusions made us develop a great number of systems. As a result, more than 25 new mascara formulas will be available as soon as April this year.” The marketing department jointly works for more efficacy with the R&D department and packaging suppliers to enhance these systems. Luxcos has grown stronger with their 10-year expertise, and can now rely on the synergies between the various services involved (laboratories, production unit, sales department and marketing department), which is facilitated by a settlement on a unique site in Luxembourg. Luxcos now intends to focus human investments on the sales department to support the growth of the company in terms of market shares. “We are also going to work on our future bulk production unit as part of an increase in our capacity. We will have the opportunity to talk about this in a few months,” concludes Christophe Delas."
L’Occitane au Brésil goes worldwide,"The two concerned ranges are based on two native Brazilian plants: jenipapo, a fruit tree from the Cerrado, and vitória régia, a water lily that blossoms only at night. The Jenipapo collection includes face and body products with fragrance and sun protection, such as a roll-on perfume oil, an SPF30 face mist, an SPF15 lip balm, an SPF15 body oil, and a transparent soap bar. The Vitória Régia collection consists of a daytime line (eau de Cologne, shower gel, body milk, hand cream and transparent soap) and a nighttime one (eau de Cologne, flower-shaped soap and transparent soap). To design the packaging of its new limited edition products, L’Occitane founder Olivier Baussan enlisted the help of two Brazilian artists: Joana Lira and Andrés Sandoval. Already available in Brazil, these new products will arrive in France and in other L’Occitane stores around the world from April 16 and will be sold through the end of summer at prices ranging from €4 to €48 (around US$5.50 to US$66.50). L’Occitane, which has been present in Brazil for almost 20 years, has started last year to produce in this country the brand L’Occitane au Brésil, with the aim to overcome trade barriers and increase its local presence and thus to develop its sales in this country, which is viewed as a keystone of the company’s growth."
Aroma-Zone gets settled on a 500 m2 area in the heart of Paris,"The new Aroma-Zone store welcomes its customers in a wholly ecodesigned environment which consists of a 300 m2 sales area on the ground floor, and a 50 m2 training area as well as a 150 m2 customized treatment area on the various other floors. The store counts 1,500 references, including about 200 essential oils from all around the world, ingredients dedicated to DIY cosmetics, and the ready-to-use skincare range. There are also a chemist, two advisers, and five digital search points to meet demands according to people’s needs - such as “devitalized skin” - or to a keyword, including the localization of articles in the various departments:  customers can thus easily find their way around and select their products. With the possibility to exchange, get some advice, benefit from a cosmetic bar with free demonstrations, or enjoy a relaxation and reading area, this place espouses both a customized and educational approach. The programme of public and professional workshops, which will take place in the training area, strengthens contact with customers. Each participant can prepare one or several recipes of natural, ultra-fresh skincare products in groups of 8 to 12 people, supervised by a naturopath or a biochemist, and then leave with their own formulations. Personalization and customization are also part of the spa’s uniqueness. A digital diagnosis, the sensorial organ of textures, a 300 ingredient base, the olfactory or musical choice for your treatment area, the bright atmosphere rendered by a variety of lights in chromography… all these elements mingle to offer an original whole for every customer to build themselves a truly unique protocol according to their needs, tastes and expectations. Five treatment areas with star-studded vaults and bright, natural colours create a cocoon effect that cannot but make everyone indulge in serenity. Aroma-Zone was founded by Pierre Vausselin and his two daughters in 2000, first as an informative website, and later as an e-store dedicated to essential oils from all around the world. It stands out for the irreproachable quality of its natural products, which are rare and made available at the right price. In 2006, the website developed their do it yourself offer and gave access to over 1,000 cosmetic DIY recipes, together with a rich catalogue of raw materials, containers, utensils, and eventually finished products. The year 2014 marks a new turn for Aroma-Zone with the opening of this new, unusual area, which should soon establish itself as a reference. “If the concept of the store-spa as we have just opened one works well, we will indeed be able to think about the same type of place in other cities in France and around the world,” says Anne Vausselin, Managing Director and co-founder of Aroma-Zone."
Faber-Castell Cosmetics: innovation and personalization,"Premium Beauty News - You are at the junction of two fiscal years. What are your comments on the past year and what do you expect from the one to come? Stefano Castelletti - Regarding Faber-Castell Cosmetics, Brazil continues to be extremely dynamic with a growth of over 40% compared to the previous two years. We also performed well in the United States with a growth of over 20%, destined to continue particularly in the premium segment. Conversely Europe, like its economy and an ongoing crisis, will have remained a little behind. As for Asia, and particularly China, it is clear that this country remains a future market for us. Brands are starting to emerge and there is a real shift upscale. To enable us to be competitive, these two criteria are essential. We have three factories in Indonesia, one in Malaysia and one in China and consequently, we are extremely well equipped to deal with local market requirements. Premium Beauty News - What is your outlook in terms of development and positioning of Faber-Castell Cosmetics? Stefano Castelletti - What we are experiencing in developed countries is quite revealing of what a company like ours should aim at. We can clearly observe that classic brands have the wind in their sails again and that at the other end of the chain, consumers are asking for ever more innovation and especially personalization. Not only must our products be flawless but they must also provide a real added value perceived by the end consumers. At the formula level, of course, but also concerning their application tools. Our teams are focusing a lot on this at Faber-Castell Cosmetics, i.e. on the megatrend “personalization”, on which we strongly believe and for which we will be presenting new and interesting concepts. The interplay of innovation, fashion trends, engineering and manufacturing together with the international market dynamics are a real challenge for the management of a B2B company in the cosmetics sector. Our industry has been and continues to be characterized by strong personalities and entrepreneurship, who have implemented their success with knowledge, experience, intuition and charismatic leadership. Premium Beauty News - Are some of the sectors where you are investing, more promising than others? Stefano Castelletti - As everyone knows, eye make-up is very promising at the moment. We are moving with this trend and plan to significantly increase our production capacity in the area. But eyes are not the only sector of interest. Lip make-up is also very dynamic with a true revival of lipstick for the years to come. Again we will support demand with not only an increased production capacity for everything that has to do with lips, but always with a desire to innovate. Latest product to date is SIMPLY RED XXL, a mat lipstick with a specific formula to achieve a moisturized and 5h long-lasting look on the lips, which creates an ultra-rich, even colour without feathering. It is available in the classic wooden Jumbo pencil or in the new Chubby Mechanical Pencil. Further novelties of our new spring collection “No Limits!” are:
– COOL CATS: a deep black 12h liquid liner with extra-long tapered tip and a cream kajal with intense finish which we will showcase in our new airtight Combo Stick.
– FLUO LIPSTICK: lightweight neon colours that create a radiant glow under UV-light.
– METALLIC CHIC: long-wearing eye- and lipliners with high iridescent pearl pigments and a smooth, even glide. The wooden pencils are refined with a special metallic lacquer and a pure chrome finish.
– BLUSH UP: a lightweight, moisturizing cream formula for lips and cheeks. Hyaluronic acid, vitamin E and Dermaxyl® prevent and smooth wrinkles. The Super Jumbo provides a convenient one-hand application. 
– With MIRACLE NAILS we developed a premium care with rich natural oils and vitamins that restores the moisture balance and deeply hydrates nails and cuticles. It is available as Nail Fluid and Nail Serum with a non-oily feeling.
– And let’s not forget our Trend Colours 2015. Premium Beauty News - Faber-Castell Cosmetics has launched its new internet site last week. What’s the benefit? Stefano Castelletti - The new site features a multitude of useful updates and navigational improvements to make the on-line experience even more user-friendly. Right from the start you will find all the latest news, such as fair guides, new product information, press releases and more. And as registered customer, you can take full advantage of our exclusive content that takes you deep into the world of Faber-Castell Cosmetics. We look forward to seeing you on-line at www.fc-cosmetics.com."
Strand Cosmetics Europe: a new step,"Premium Beauty News - First changes this year at Strand Cosmetics Europe, with your forthcoming appointment, Eric, to an operational position as the Managing Director and you Dominique, with the intensification of your commitment in R&D. Éric Bouvier - Yes, the Board of Strand Cosmetics Europe decided to reconfigure the management team to suit the new development goals that we set ourselves in terms of turnover increase, extension of our industrial activity and internationalization. Dominique Bouvier - And for my part, my personal investment will be fully focused on research and innovation. If we look back at the thirty-four past years, we can be proud – with all the teams at Strand – of having built a sound company, with one of its important milestone being the transfer of our activities in 2001, on the current site of La Source in Lentilly. Premium Beauty News - At the age of 53, Éric Bouvier, these responsibilities are in line with your career… Éric Bouvier - Indeed, both my training and professional experience stick well to the goals we have set ourselves. I am a Doctor in Pharmacy; in 1993, I graduated with an MBA degree from the Management School of Lyon and did a stint at the London Business School. Professionally, I was President and CEO of a NASDAQ listed U.S. company, BG Medicine, a start-up specialised in the diagnosis of heart disease. Prior to that, I led Leica Microsystems in Germany after being Deputy Director General of the BioMérieux Group in charge of the Immunoassays and Human Resources global division. A Group in which I also acted as President of the subsidiary in the United States, BioMérieux Inc., Vice-President of the ATU (Advanced Technologies Unit) and President of Apibio. Premium Beauty News - Sport also holds an important place in your career and your encounter! Éric Bouvier - You are right once again, since in 2000, I was the CEO of Occade Sport (creation of the website, Le Club du Sport.com) based in Caluire in the Lyon region. I also took part to two Olympic Games in 1988 and 1992 with the French volley ball Team. And everyone knows the sporting career of Dominique. It’s actually near the sports courts that we met more than 35 years ago. More than a necessity, sport is a philosophy that conveys a lot of positive concepts - concepts which, for some of them, are fully applicable to the corporate world. Premium Beauty News - Your forthcoming appointment as CEO of Strand Cosmetics is in line with your commitment, and that of your equity partners, in the development of this company you acquired in 1980. What are the next steps of this development? Éric Bouvier - Indeed I actually know the company very well and the company knows me well too. I took part with Dominique and our shareholders to all the phases of recovery and development of Strand Cosmetics Europe. The work that was undertaken by all the teams in the past years is remarkable and fantastic. May I recall the main pillars that support this development: Creation/Innovation, Quality/Regulation, and Internationalization. Thanks to them, we have become one of the European leaders not to say the world leader in our field. Our name and our expertise are acknowledged worldwide and we intend to increase our export share from 32% to more than 50% in the next five years, by reinforcing our activities in Asia, Brazil but also Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the Middle East. Accounting for 60% of our sales, make-up remains the spearhead of the company, with a significant portion coming from foundation. We also gained significant market shares with powders and lipsticks. The skincare activity has grown steadily. We packed a total of more than 9 million units last year. Premium Beauty News - Your “pharmaceutical” experience comes into play at the right time! Your forthcoming investments prove it. Éric Bouvier - Well, as you know ...., according to the good old saying, “there’s no time but the right time” As you know, the boundary between make-up and skin care products, not to mention health products, has never been so narrow. Market demands are heading towards that direction and we have decided to follow the trend. Hence a new building will soon be built from the ground up, on our La Source site at Lentilly near Lyon and it will complement the existing 8,200 sqm. It will host very “Medical Device”-oriented OTC premises and with of course an FDA certification. To note that on the regulatory side we are going to get the ISO 14000 and ISO 18000 certifications. And as you know, we obtained the ISO 9001 certification more than a decade ago and the ISO 22716 certification three years ago. Premium Beauty News - The concept of team is a key component for you? Dominique Bouvier and Éric Bouvier - Essential, indeed! It is through dialogue and respect for the given word that we can build a lasting relationship of trust, a key element for the success of any team, in both an entrepreneurial or sport environment. Strand Cosmetics Europe employs today more than 140 people with an average age under 38. One third of the staff comes from reputable regional schools or universities (engineers, pharmacists, chemists, microbiologists, computer specialists, colourists, galenists...). We spend a lot on training (three times the legal requirements). We have an entrepreneurial and very “German” vision of the business. We favour development and long-term sustainability by building on strong relations of partnership with our customers and suppliers."
Nail polish: U.S. company Keystone and its Polychromatic division are investing,"Premium Beauty News - A company whose history goes way back? And a family business too! Cary Robinson - Yes, absolutely! The history of Keystone dates back to 1898. The company was bought by my father in 1968, almost half a century ago, at the time it employed thirty people for a turnover of $ 4 million. Its main activity was focused on the production of monomers and polymers for the dental sector, with a strong R & D expertise in these technologies and the industrial quality requirement associated with this sector. Then, thanks to this technical cross-disciplinary expertise, the company gradually began to move towards the fast growing segment of nail gels, where we filed significant patents.  This was our first encounter with the cosmetics industry where, in no time, we became one of its leading and acknowledged actors. It is indeed important to stress on this historical mastery of monomer and polymer production, because it is on this core activity that we managed to built our expertise, bring talented teams together, build our learning curve up to marketing. Hence, today, we can legitimately claim providing a real “plus” in the manufacture and marketing of nail polish. Our strategy is based on strong technological advances, a highly reliable and qualitative industrial tool (GMP, ISO, Pharma), breakthrough innovations, combined with a differentiated marketing offer to support our clients. Premium Beauty News - What difference does the ability to manage these manufacturing processes precisely make? What is actually the “plus” that you bring in the designing of nail polishes? Cary Robinson - We have brought considerable progress in the development of nail polish. For example, I can tell you that we were able to improve very significantly the four functional parameters - which are Adhesion, Brightness, Application, Drying - both through our know-how in formulation with our expertise and the added value of new ingredients, and the manufacturing processes. On adhesion, which is a parameter for which demand is often unsatisfied, our results are exceptional and - in accordance with our strategy of technological sustainability - protected by a strong patenting policy. We also invested particularly in stability issues to reduce consumers’ perceptions of poor quality, I am referring to syneresis, and sedimentation. Concerned about market expectations for coloured products, like some pastel shades, and also nail care products, we have also managed to develop a new technology that reduces the risks of yellowing of nitrocellulose over time. With this know-how and technology, we are also capable of meeting new requirements, which are important, concerning care products in the nail care segment. Premium Beauty News - You have launched a consistent investment program! Cary Robinson - If we put together the financial efforts already made in the United States and those to come in Europe and Brazil, it indeed makes a lot of money. In the Pennsylvania plant where we produce nail polish and offer an “Open Lab” of active development and dedicated to our clients for the past six months, this represents some US$ 40 million to which must be added five million in The Netherlands and the same amount in Brazil. To note that we invest for both gels and nail polishes. Today, we export from the United States about 40% of our production, two-thirds of which go to Europe with Germany on top of the list of customer countries followed by Italy. Russia is an important market for us as well as the Middle East and China. Premium Beauty News - The investment is just as important in R&D? Cary Robinson - That’s right! 20% of our staff is dedicated to R&D.  Our teams, our high-tech equipment, the constant search for new more efficient manufacturing protocols, lab surfaces, are all very important. This is the core of our original knowledge. We draw our DNA from it, for the sole benefit of our customers. We redesigned our in-site lab at Gibbstown to integrate a dedicated area for our customer so that they can stay in permanent touch with the developers during the creation phase and for the latter to better keep track of the customer’s requirements. We have a very competent and talented cross–disciplinary team in both the manufacturing field, and the marketing area. While the appeal of the nail polish market’s high cycle has led to many changes in capital during the last three years, the strategy of a family business like Keystone, which is part of an ongoing process, offers through its investments, its high capacity, and its innovations, a new growth driver in nail polish. We had conceitedly claimed, but also in a spirit of challenge, “Reinventing nail polish”, we reached our goal on the nail gel segment; today in the more traditional nail polish segment, the performance and the differentiation of our offer are such that we want the profession to take advantage from it, starting with the forthcoming Cosmoprof in Bologna."
Strong growth for Weckerle in the United States,"With this relocation, Weckerle increased twofold its filling capacity in lipsticks. In addition to increasing its production capacity, the company also equipped itself with R&D capabilities and reinforced its sales force. Meanwhile growth has only accelerated. After experiencing a rise of over 30% in recent months with the arrival of new manufacturing and filling equipments, officials expect another similar increase in the next two years. From just a little more than 30 people on average, the staff can jump to nearly 150 when demand is high. “The production of lipstick remains our main workhorse,” explained Mauricio Pachon, General Manager of Weckerle USA. The year 2013 saw the commissioning of a new machine that is already in operation and for 2014, we are increasing further our capabilities with a very versatile filling unit. A growth that can also be explained, according to officials, by the Group’s ability to adapt to changes in demand. “Our production capacity can very quickly be transferred any place in the world where the Group is operating and our customers know it,"" explained Mauricio Pachon. To sustain its growth, the firm also builds on its innovation capacity, particularly in the area of multi-component products. “We are putting in place all the fundamentals to maintain and sustain our turnover growth for Weckerle USA in the next three years,” highlighted Mauricio Pachon."
L’Oréal : net sales on the rise and record operating margin,"“2013 was another year of robust growth for L’Oréal. The Group achieved sustained sales growth and, in a market whose expansion was more moderate in 2013, accelerated its outperformance versus the market,” said its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jean-Paul Agon. In 2013, the French group’s sales amounted to 22.977 billion euros, an increase of +2.3% compared to the previous year.  The like-for-like sales trend of theL’Oréal Group was +5.0% and +6.0% at constant exchange rates. The group’s growth was driven by the L’Oréal Luxe (+5.3%) and Active Cosmetics (+4.9%) divisions. According to the group, the L’Oréal Luxe division  (Lancôme, Yves Saint Laurent, Giorgio Armani, …) grew significantly faster than the market, in all geographical areas.  For instance, Lancôme’s La Vie est Belle established itself as a top seller.  Travel Retail, which will form its own division in 2014, also outperformed the market. As far as it is concerned, the Active Cosmetics division (Vichy, La Roche Posay, SkinCeauticals, …) strengthened its position as the world leader in the dermocosmetics market. The Professional Products Division (Kérastase, Matrix, L’Oréal Professionnel, Essie, …) recorded growth of +2.1% like-for-like and -1.0% based on reported figures in a channel that was still affected by declining salon visits in the mature markets, but remains dynamic in the New Markets. Eventually, the Consumer Products Division posted growth of +4.9% like-for-like and +1.5% based on reported figures. “The Division is outperforming the global market and winning market share,” comments [1]. Strong growth in “New Markets” In terms of geographic zones, Western Europe (+1.1%) remains a strong basis for the group and North America (+2.8%) keeps on growing, despite that the market was less dynamic than in 2012. Growth in the ""New Markets"" remains strong, approaching or exceeding the double digits like-for-like. However, reported figures are negatively impacted by currency fluctuations (-3.7% for the whole group).  In the Asia-Pacific area, L’Oréal recorded annual growth of +8.4% (+9.5% excluding Japan) like-for-like and +2.2% based on reported figures, despite slower growth in China and India.  In Latin America, L’Oréal recorded growth of +11.5% like-for-like and +3.7% based on reported figures.  In Eastern Europe, sales increased by +8.2% like-for-like and +4.2% based on reported figures. Regrading Africa and Middle East, sales increased by +14.3% like-for-like and +9.0% based on reported figures, reflecting the good performances of the new subsidiary in Saudi Arabia, strong growth in the Gulf states, Egypt and Pakistan and the recent acquisition of Interbeauty in Kenya. All the Divisions recorded double-digit growth in 2013. Lastly, profitability reached a record level in 2013, with an operating profit of 3.875 billion euros, representing 16.9% of sales (up by 0.4 points). “The quality of these results illustrates the Group’s ability to continue to deliver sustainable and profitable growth. We are starting 2014 with confidence, driven by our mission of ‘Beauty for All’, the power of our research and innovations, the strength of our portfolio of complementary brands and the globalisation of our major brands. In an economic context that is still marked by uncertainties, particularly on the monetary front, L’Oréal is confident in its ability to outperform the market once again in 2014, and to achieve another year of sales and profit growth,” concluded Mr. Agon."
REN Clean Skincare partners with Nocibé to grow in France,"Created in London in 2000, REN Clean Skincare is now distributed in over 30 countries. As far as the turnover is concerned, the UK remains the brand’s largest market, followed by North America (U.S. and Canada) and Scandinavia (Denmark, Norway, Sweden). In France, while not being negligible, the distribution of the brand remained rather modest until now.  REN was available in some Parisian concept stores like Colette, Nose, Oh My Cream, at the Bon Marché department store in Paris, in a dozen Galeries Lafayette, in Paris and across France, as well as in about thirty independant retailers.  ""The French market is very difficult and highly concentrated,"" explains Mohamed Rezal, the brand’s international business development manager. The new partnership with Nocibé will allow REN to be distributed in 367 additional points of sales. At the heart of the brand, is the so-called ""clean"" formulation technology. “Clean” is precisely the meaning of ""ren"" in Norwegian or Swedish. The concept consists in selecting the “safest ingredients”, preferably but not only natural substances, and to focus on efficiency and to turn to available high-tech solutions.  ""It’s not herbal tea, but it’s clean,"" says Colette Haydon, the French cosmetologist behinds the products’ formulations. Shortly speaking, REN’s recipe for success lays in three words: performance, purity, pleasure. However, Nocibé explains that, beyond the technical performance, REN was also selected for its price accessibility. REN Clean Skincare offers a range of more than 40 face and body care products, intended for both women and men, for both mature and young skins. Among the brand’s best sellers are: – the Evercalm range, for sensitive skins, formulated to minimize allergic risks, that help to fight redness and all the inconvenience of sensitive skins,
–  the Bio-Retinoid anti-wrinkles range that delivers retinol results without irritating effects,
– the Keep Young and Beautiful SH²C Serum, formulated to keep skin looking smoother, firmer, younger and more radiant,
– the Glycolactic Radiance Renewal Mask, a potent bio active peel mask designed to renew the complexion, reduce the appearance of fine lines and dramatically improve skin tone within 10 minutes, Next March, the brand will add two new references: V-Cense Revitalising Night Cream, based on essential Boswellia Carterii essential oil, an active known for its incense smell and relaxing properties, and V-Cense Youth Vitality Day Cream, also based on Boswellia Carterii, to fight environmental stress and prevent and minimize the signs of premature ageing. REN will also launch next May, V-Cense “Flash Rinse Intensive 1 Minute Facial”, with boswellic acid, magnesium and stabilised Vitamin C."
"“Ethical sensitivity should be matched with the act of purchase”, Betty Santonnat, COSMEBIO","Premium Beauty News – What is COSMEBIO’s main mission today? Betty Santonnat - Our top priority is to support natural and organic cosmetic brands, especially by promoting our labels. The COSMEBIO association, which was founded by about ten laboratories, now gathers more than 400 members, 90 % of which are French, but which also come from everywhere around the world. The rise in the number of members came naturally, along with the increase in consumer demand. We have aimed at contributing to the growth of this market since the beginning by providing clearer information to consumers and defining what “organic” is in cosmetics. We have enhanced the development of standards with specialized organisations, Ecocert and Qualité France/Bureau Véritas. To benefit from the COSMEBIO label, products must meet the requirements of these standards, and manufacturers must be members of our association, and therefore respect our charter, which imposes additional commitments, in particular on the ethical level. We also demand a true commitment: for a brand to become a member of our association, at least 20 % of the product range must be certified. Another important mission for us consists in supporting and professionalizing our members who, for example, must take part in at least one training session among those offered by COSMEBIO. Our ambition today is also to promote our label worldwide. Premium Beauty News - Weren’t you disappointed by the growth of the organic cosmetic market? Betty Santonnat - The growth of this market was strongly supported in the past few years, and it paved the way for the emergence of many brands and for the development of a great number of innovations. Today it is still growing, although the pace has slowed down a bit. Disappointment comes from the small market share of natural and organic cosmetics, which does not exceed 5 % in France, and rarely more elsewhere. The priority for brands is to capture new customers, and the COSMEBIO association must support them to this aim. Consumers’ strong sensitivity towards ethical and environmental issues should be matched with the act of purchase. Organic cosmetics still suffer from early disappointments, when consumers used to conventional textures and formulas might have been surprised by natural products which sometimes failed to offer the same textures as their competitors. However, today the quality of formulations has greatly improved, in particular because more organic substances are available to laboratories. People just don’t know about what natural and organic cosmetic brands actually propose, and they are often prejudiced. It should not be forgotten that most of these brands, 85 % of our members, are SMEs or very small companies that cannot afford mass advertising. That is why our role is even more important. Our collective actions aim at showing organic cosmetics can seduce. They used to be presented in much too technical terms. Premium Beauty News – Was launching the Nat label in September a way to counter these received ideas? Betty Santonnat - It’s a way to meet a new need of the market. This label is based on the new COSMOS standard, which harmonises the different European labels. COSMOS makes provision for a “natural cosmetic” category, which still does not really exist in France today, whereas it is already well-established in Germany. Organic issues acted as a trigger and enabled to raise awareness of the problem. However, their impact on people’s minds and on brands was much stronger than its actual market share. For some consumers, it is a choice that is viewed as “extreme”. The natural market seems a better growth driver, but it still remains to define what natural is, and generate confidence by eliminating greenwashing. That is what the Nat label aims at. To benefit from it, products must comply with the technical specifications of the COSMOS standard, and manufacturers must share the values of the COSMEBIO ethical charter by becoming a member of the association. For organic as well as natural products, certification remains the only reliable guarantee for consumers. These products meet actual needs. They are more sustainable, have a lower environmental impact and are also reassuring for consumers."
"“The market is shifting from colour to texture,” Romualdo Priore, Chromavis","Premium Beauty News - How is the integration of Chromavis within the Fareva group happening? Romualdo Priore - For Fareva, the acquisition of Chromavis is a new experience. Although the group has made numerous acquisitions during the recent years, Chromavis will be the first independent entity within Fareva.  Actually, the two companies are very different with very distinct product portfolios.  Fareva is a strong filler and contract manufacturer, in particular in the skincare or aerosol fields.  Chromavis is renowned for its innovations and technological products in colour cosmetics. Furthermore, Fareva has a large international network with strong manufacturing capabilities; these are strong assets and real opportunities for the development of Chromavis. Eventually, Fareva owns manufacturing sites that are OTC approved by the US FDA and this is an important advantage for developing sales in the US market where most of the make-up products have SPF claims, and are therefore classified as OTC drugs. Premium Beauty News - The acquisition of Chromavis is also the opportunity for Fareva to enter the nail polish market. Romualdo Priore - Indeed, in 2010 Chromavis acquired Durlin France, one of the world’s leaders in the development and production of nail polishes.  Durlin had a catalogue of high quality products and we brought our strong marketing culture to them. Premium Beauty News - What are your latest innovations? Romualdo Priore - Based on our expertise in baked powdered products, Chromavis is the world’s leading producer of these kind of products, we recently launched Metamorphosis a new kind of formula, more creamy, providing increased transparency and a second skin feeling.  Actually, the market is shifting from colour to texture, seasonal collections are no longer the norm."
Hapsatou Sy refocuses on product ranges,"Premium Beauty News - At the very beginning of your adventure, there was this original conception of “global beauty”. How does the HapsatouSy brand position itself today? Hapsatou Sy - We had launched our brand as a beauty salon brand via a stand-alone network, first as Ethnicia, and then as HapsatouSy. Very soon, we started developing several hair and skin care brands, such as Ethnicia and HapsatouSy, followed by Artisan Make Up and Dazzia. We have been working for many years in the development of these brands, and the liquidation of the salons network made us rethink our whole strategy and to focus on the development and marketing of our own products. On the model of what we made in the salons network, all our brands consist in an offering of products adapted to all the various types of beauty. The point was to counter a sort of ghettoization, which tended to force black, Maghreb, Asian or mixed-blood women to look for other brands or sales outlets than those found in traditional networks. This never sounded logical to me! Some white women have very curly, even frizzy hair, and complexion differences are considerable both for so-called black and white skins. I did not want to reproduce the segregation I had known. That’s why we still offer products that are adapted to particular types of hair (dry, brittle, curly, etc.) or skin, but not to types of people. We are going on with our adventure by following the same concept, but with new distribution networks. Premium Beauty News - What lessons have you learnt from this experience? Hapsatou Sy - The compulsory liquidation of our activities with beauty salons was obviously a traumatic period, but in the end it was positive for our brand because there were actual problems of coherence within our network. This is what is tricky with a network of franchisees, you sometimes have to deal with businessmen and women with strong personalities, who have their own vision of the development of their activity. Today we devote our whole energy to the development of our four product lines: Artisan Make Up, our makeup brand, which counts more than a hundred references, Dazzia, a brand for professionals specialized in hair smoothing techniques, Ethnicia, a nail polish and beauty product brand with affordable prices, and HapsatouSy, which is a high-end brand comprising hair care and skincare products. Premium Beauty News - The growth of these brands will depend on the development of new distribution networks. Hapsatou Sy - Our products are currently available on the new HapsatouSy online shop, which we thoroughly rethought and relaunched on November 18, 2013. American e-store Doobop.com has also been selling the HapsatouSy and Ethnicia brands since October 15, 2013. This site, which is one of Oprah Winfrey’s favourites, is destined for all beauty types throughout the world, and highlights the richness of diversity. It perfectly suits our philosophy. HapsatouSy, Ethnicia and Artisan Make Up products have also been available on Brandalley.fr since November 25, 2013. Of course, increasing our sales also depends on a physical sales outlet network in France and around the world. We are already distributed in about fifty points of sale in the USA and in Africa (Angola, Ivory Coast, Gabon and Senegal). We often receive requests from pharmacy networks, and we should soon open in about a hundred new sales outlets in the French overseas departments and territories. Obviously, the development of these partnerships must be achieved in keeping with each one of our lines. As for HapsatouSy in particular, we destine this brand for selective channels. It aims at active, urban women, with a core target between 25 and 40 years old. It is an affordable high-end brand. Premium Beauty News - Are you thinking of reopening your own new concept stores? Hapsatou Sy - No, not at all. Our top priority is to develop new products and reinforce our brands."
Ancorotti Cosmetics: sales over 20 million euros in 2013,"And yet in 2009 things were looking less rosy, when the greatest economic crisis to hit the Western world in over seventy years was just beginning.  “My daughter and I realised the potential of the mascara market,” says Renato Ancorotti. “All the surveys show that if there’s just one product women really have to have it’s mascara! Mascara is also a very complex product to manufacture with a lot depending on the applicator used. There’s a very close bond between the two. That’s why brands demand greater security of supply and a total quality guarantee. And this is precisely what we offer.” The company has clearly not skimped on its industrial resources to meet these needs. In four years, its number of production and storage units has risen from one building in a Crema industrial zone to seven covering 10,000 m². And that is set to grow still further next year with the addition of 3,000 m². Ancorotti Cosmetics counts no less than ten filling lines, and increased its capacity to 30,000 units per day just a few weeks ago. “Mascara is still our spearhead, and represents over eighty-five percent of our current business,” says Renato Ancorotti, “but we also rely heavily on the back injection technique to produce eyeshadow.” The Italian firm has invested several hundred thousand euros over the past few weeks in the implementation of this technique. Nine machines with a total capacity of 40,000 parts/day now work together in one of Crema’s seven buildings. And it’s not over yet. Not only does the company intend to increase its influence in other niche make-up markets (powder, foundation, etc.), it also wants to continue expanding its geographic footprint throughout the world. Especially since, in terms of production capacity, there is room for manoeuvre with more than 20% still available. “I have to admit, requests are pouring in from everywhere,” says Renato Ancorotti. “Almost 80% of our customers are based in Europe, but there is huge potential in other continents. Which is another reason why we make they very most of the marketing opportunities opened up by the trade shows developing overseas, such as MakeUp in New York and now MakeUp in Seoul.” The firm prides itself on its sales presence in some twenty countries worldwide, and rightly so. To this has been added Ancorotti SkinCare, whose production unit based in north Milan will be transferred to the Crema site in the coming weeks. “Here too, development prospects are particularly bright,” says Renato Ancorotti. “We expect a 47% increase in 2014 and almost 60% next year with a sales target for 2015 expected to approach 3.5 million euros.”"
Mascara Plus: strong growth in 2013,"Premium Beauty News - So you were right to move to Inzago! David Chant - Yes, absolutely! The operation cost us 3 million euros, which is a heavy investment for a young company like ours, but we had no choice. The plant has a total capacity, depending on the number of production hours, of more than 30 tonnes per month, sometimes as much as three times that. And the filling workshop has a capacity of 75,000 pieces a day. We also have our own brush production line with an output of 60,000 brushes per day. Premium Beauty News - One of your strengths remains your search for new formulas. David Chant - One of our latest developments is our mascara, which you’re familiar with, composed of two different formulas with different viscosities that are mixed just before application. We’re also working on other brand-new formulas, which we’ll probably be presenting at the next Cosmoprof in Bologna and maybe at MakeUp in Seoul too. Our chemists and R&D departments are constantly researching natural materials to develop the most innovative mascaras.  After thorough research, our chemists conduct compatibility testing through emulsifying trials, before then performing quality control on the chemical-physical parameters (pH, viscosity & density) of the finished product. Once stability testing is complete, Mascara Plus’ laboratory sends mascara bulk to external labs for microbiological testing and chemical quality control. Depending on what service the client wants, for example a bulk, bulk & filling or full service, our labs perform the necessary compatibility testing of the applicator, packaging in respect to the bulk. In addition to the aforementioned laboratory, we opened our second laboratory in Thailand several months ago, which explains why we are so interested."
Make-up: FSKorea is investing in a new sponge manufacturing plant,"FSKorea’s new plant is located in Hebei, Cangzhou city, China and with a surface of 8,800 sqm formatted to produce some 30 million units per year (NBR, SBR, Cotton Puff, Flocking, EPDM, Cellulose). To note that the plant is using toxic-free sponge (latex free) materials with a toxic neutralizing agent. Amount invested: one million dollars. A new production plant for this Korean company which comes in addition to the one that produces more than 100 million mascaras per year and to other plants in Asia and even in Belgium that produce brushes, compacts, airless packagings and eyeliners. “FSKorea,” explains its President, J.K. Hwang, “is a company that built its prosperity through innovation and creativity. We are constantly looking for new ways to meet and exceed customer requirements in terms of design. Our teams also provide turnkey packaging development solutions, while maintaining a precise control of the budget and draft according to the set deadlines.” Since its inception in 1988, FSKorea remains indeed a model of its kind in terms of development. That year, the firm with only 10 people, was manufacturing its first brushes in a small factory to achieve a turnover of USD 230,000. In 2000 the company posted a turnover of USD 12 million and with a staff of 400 people! In 2005, a fourth plant for the manufacturing of brushes emerged, also in China, north of Beijing and a fifth on in 2007. During the year 2009 the Research & Development Centre was created in Seoul. In 2010, the Head of FSKorea decided to acquire a metal processing plant with a staff of 150. Last year FSKorea will have seen its sales reach the USD 40 million mark."
LVMH gives a new dimension to its perfumes and cosmetics R&D,"Approximately 250 researchers today, nearly 300 in a near future, 1,200 new product formulas developed each year and a portfolio of 200 patents: LVMH Recherche is spearheading the development of the French luxury giant in the field of perfumes and cosmetics. The inauguration on November 18 of its new premises, located on the site of the Parfums Christian Dior plant, in Saint-Jean-de-Braye, near Orléans, emphasises the importance of perfumes and cosmetics within the group’s global growth strategy. With 55 hectares, the site of Parfums Christian Dior is one of the largest areas dedicated to perfumes and luxury cosmetics in France. On this site, the new Helios research centre gathers most of the research and development of the brands Parfums Christian Dior, Parfums Givenchy, Guerlain and Fresh, and also develops products for Kenzo, MakeUp For Ever, Aqua di Parma or Benefit Cosmetics. Its 18,000 sqm are distributed in a set of six three level buildings forming a perfectly equilateral triangle. LVMH has invested over 30 million euros in the construction and development of this new centre, which is fully operational since the end of October.  Over 20 key areas of expertise are gathered on the site, including  molecular and cell biology, physical chemistry, ethnobotany, sensory analysis, formulation and histology, as well as safety and efficiency control, regulatory compliance, sensory evaluation and market trends monitoring, among others. Located in the heart of the Cosmetic Valley, a cluster gathering about 300 members - of which 78 % are SMEs - and 7 universities, and covering seven departments across three regions (Centre, Haute Normandie, Ile- de- France) in France, Helios will also be one of the two entities of the Skinovalys project, the other being the University of Orleans that will focus on basic research. Specifically, the centre will allow researchers outside the LVMH group, academics, but also from start-ups and small and micro businesses, to find in a temporary shelter for the completion of their experimental projects and thus benefiting from Helios’ the state-of-the-art equipment (electro-microscopy devices, cell culture materials, genomic targeting tools, etc.) at interesting prices. Applications to join the programme will be centralized by the Cosmetic Valley. Beyond the regional level, LVMH Recherche also boasts numerous partnerships with universities in France (Bordeaux, Paris VI) or abroad (Modena, Shanghai, Stanford, Zurich), or with independent experts, particularly in the field of ethnobotany . On the occasion of inauguration ceremony, LVMH managers confirmed its next development steps, in particular its interest in completing its portfolio with another skincare allow the group to better meet the needs of Asian customers. However, according to Reuters, Antonio Belloni, Group Managing Director of LVMH, would consider that Clarins, which is often mentioned as a potential target, is a too big prey. The group would favour a smaller brand offering strong development opportunities. Nevertheless, the group is giving priority to organic growth, including the development of is Fresh brand in Asia. The American bath and skin care brand joined the LVMH group in 2000. Fresh now has 15 own stores worldwide and its products are available in many prestigious points of sale around the globe, including North America, China, Hong Kong, Korea and Singapore."
IL Cosmetics is gaining momentum!,"At the forefront of the novelties showcased by IL Cosmetics: a last generation of formulas that enables to solve all the stability issues which mostly affect export markets. To note also the launch of a new technology which enables to optimize the key parameters of a polish: an improved glide upon application, an improved uniformity for a smoother finish and, in addition an enhanced brightness, an improved shine for visibly brighter shades. Not to mention a range of formulas dedicated to glitters, covering all the needs in this segment.  “You mustn’t forget that for glitters to remain stable and in suspension, additives used had a tendency to make the formula murkier. It was a real challenge to achieve this type of transparency. With an ever increasing level of requirements these past years, we must also deal with often conflicting demands, like for example getting both a good product suspension and bright, transparent polishes, and with increasingly shorter drying times!” explained Aurélie Ignaccolo, Marketing Manager. But that’s not all! In addition to the doubling of its production and conditioning capacity for nail polish, IL Cosmetics has announced the construction of a new building which will be fully dedicated to the production of make-up products and will be operational in late 2014. A building which, according to officials, will be at the forefront of technology as far as good manufacturing practices are concerned.  “In the course of these two years,” explains Ignaccolo, “the group will have invested a total of between seven and eight million euros.” Main customer markets for the company, Europe followed by Asia, the United States, Latin America and Turkey. “But it’s definitely on the American continents – North and South – that we will focus our efforts in the coming months,” she said."
Schwan Cosmetics invests USD 38 million in new US facility,"The cosmetics manufacturer announced yesterday the company will merge Schwan Cosmetics’ Cosmolab facility in Lewisburg, Tennessee, and its Schwan Cosmetics USA facility in Piscataway, New Jersey, into a new facility that will be located in Murfreesboro, in Rutherford County, Tenessee.

"“There is a lot of quality and depth in British beauty brands” Séan Harrington, Elemis","Premium Beauty News - How does Elemis size up against the competition in the premium beauty industry? Séan Harrington - Elemis is one of the leading British beauty brands with a turnover of £75m (about 90 billion euros) in 53 countries. In the UK, we have reached a strong position of influence and market share. The past five years have seen our best performance, despite the economic downturn. Pre-Elemis, I experienced many ups and down, including going through receivership, which taught me what not to do.  So in 2008, the signs were there for me and I remodelled the entire business, dropping headcount by 30% and stripping back the cost base. In 2009, we were able to deliver profitability and from there built a very lean business. I believe that emerging brands can react quicker and appeal to the undecided consumer during uncertain economic times. The boom years tend to favour the bigger corporations. Premium Beauty News - What is the potential for British beauty brands overseas? Séan Harrington - It’s been a really exciting time for British brands over the last three years, following the Royal Wedding, which was conducted with class and humour and the Olympics that combined competition with creativity. Great Britain is perceived as having heritage and considered trustworthy and principled, not just in the world of beauty, but in fine fragrance, aromatics and technology in beauty. There is a lot of quality and depth in British brands. It’s a fantastic time to sell overseas. When I travel overseas I see that British brands are well represented. Asia is crying out for whatever Britain can throw at it and the emerging markets in India and Russia are also keen to have British brands. Through our association with Steiner Leisure, Elemis has 160 spas on cruise liners and 85 in resorts. But you can’t succeed abroad until you have a level of success at home. This is something we are working on, but it can be challenging when you are working with different cultures, languages and time zones and there is a lack of awareness for your brand. It’s only sustainable if you have the resources to support your brand. Premium Beauty News - What is your strategy for retail vs spa? Séan Harrington - Elemis is a multi-channel business and our spas and beauty salons represent 50% of our total. I wouldn’t want the percentage spa represents to be any bigger. The remainder is divided into thirds between retail, online and QVC. We were one of the first beauty brands to launch on QVC and have been number one for the past 18 months. Since our launch on QVC in 1994, there have been no peaks and troughs, just a continuous upwards growth. We do 20% of our business in department stores and deliver a range of services aimed at getting consumers to spend time at the counter and to visit our stores more frequently. In October, a new counter opened in the refurbished Debenhams store on Oxford Street offering a whole new image, which is forward looking and incorporates a lot of interactivity. The game plan is to put a big investment into retail, regenerate the offering in high street beauty salons and invest in e-commerce. Premium Beauty News - Which are your most successful product lines? Séan Harrington - Product development is incredibly important for Elemis and we have fantastic innovation coming through with exclusives for QVC and ecommerce. Our largest franchise is Pro-Collagen, which has been extended with several new lines and lots more development planned. It takes a long time to find something that good. The hero product is Pro-Collagen Marine Cream which is ten years old and has entered the canon of beauty greats. There were 52 formulations for Pro-Collagen before we achieved what we wanted, which is an anti-ageing formula packed with ingredients, including three different types of seaweed and liposomes of gingko biloba which galvanise the micro circulation of the face. Today, it’s the only anti-ageing skincare line with collagen sold on airlines. Premium Beauty News - What is Elemis doing in beauty salons that is innovative? Séan Harrington - We looked at mobile phone technology which is capable of carrying so much data and thought how we could apply this to machinery in salons, which still tends to be very large and cumbersome. Next year, we will launch a new 5-in-1 treatment machine in salons called Biotec. Noella Gabriel, director of UK sales, training and new product development, has been empowered to create a new treatment menu for Biotec that incorporates the best from the world of high-end skin care technology. Biotec is the next generation of Elemis professional treatment facials including lifting and toning to light therapy and an ultrasonic peel that works as an alternative to microdermabrasian. Techno beauty for in-home use is a huge and fast-growing category. We’ve looked at the success of Clarisonic and at the end of next year will be introducing our own version designed to complement Elemis in-salon treatments. Premium Beauty News - What is your goal for Elemis? Séan Harrington - To double our turnover in the next five years. I have a clear plan and know where we can do it and how to make it happen. We are still growing, learning, emerging and aspiring  - these are all words I like to use."
USA: The Color Factory changes its name to Cosmetic Group USA again,"Premium Beauty News - The company that you helped create more than twenty five years ago is enjoying a complete revival? What happened in recent years and how far has your company gone now? Judy Zegarelli -  The Company was founded in 1984 in Marina del Rey, California by Alfred Booth and me. The company moved to Sun Valley California in January 1990. In 1997, we sold the Company. Then the Company changed names to The Color Factory and changed hands several times, mainly to financial holding companies, until the arrival of its new current owner, Jonathan Mitchell, an entrepreneur who decided to support us in the revival of the Company and gave the management of the Company to Andrea Chuchvara. The consequences of this new impetus given to the Company by the current team are obviously huge. Between 2012 and 2013, we simply doubled the turnover. Thanks to investments made possible both through the personal involvement of Jonathan Mitchell and also the firm’s newfound health, the renewal of the fleet of machines has become a priority. Premium Beauty News - And you chose to go for the name of origin?  Judy Zegarelli - That’s right! Cosmetic Group USA was a perfect name. It has at least the advantage of being clear and to show our abilities. And on top of it, it is one of the mainstays of a positive past that we are currently reviving. Premium Beauty News - A few words on the tool you have in your hands today? Judy Zegarelli - Let’s go back to basics.

Our next target in two years’ time, a new plant."
From the sponge to the “turnkey” applicator,"Main production units, Korea, of course, with headquarters just a few minutes from the Seoul International Airport, but also China.  More than 80 people in the first unit and +300 in the second, Sponge & Puff World (S&P World) will achieve this year a turnover of twenty million dollars. Main markets, Korea with about 40% of sales, followed by the U.S. (25%) and Europe. (20%). “Today, explains James Moon, Commercial Director, what matters for us is to offer and sell a sponge or a powder puff with its applicator or it support, on a turnkey basis. The markets of sponges or powder puff alone are extremely competitive and the number of producers is on the rise.”  This means lots of innovations to come up with for this major Korean player in his field. “Innovation has become a second nature,” agrees Moon. “We never stop devising on the shape a new sponge or a puff will take for such and such applicator.”  The company has also developed a network of partners specialized in plastic injection with whom it develops new make-up cases and applicator concepts. Latest innovations to date, a whole range of rollers fitted with small cylindrical sponges but also Pen-Tip/Brush applicators for lip gloss, eyeliners or eye-shadows. Not to mention Brush-on-tubes and, of course, a variety of powder jars.  “You couldn’t believe the shapes we invent every day for our sponges!” we were told at S&P World. “In fact,” stresses Moon, “the leading position we have acquired over the years can be explained by both the quality and consistency of our products but also the flexibility and timeliness of our deliveries. The concept of ‘time to market’ is also our everyday philosophy.”"
"Dario Ferrari, Intercos “What matters the most is our ability to anticipate and innovate”","Innovation is not just a word, it is an everyday philosophy for each components of this Group with a firmly established reputation in this area.  “Of course it requires being wisely undertaken,” agrees Ferrari.  “Innovation is first the concrete result of a good anticipation of consumer demand. And that’s precisely where the difficulty lies. How to nose out and properly conceptualize the underlying trends in the four corners of the world where tastes and colours are different? We must go beyond the simple material innovation. For a large part, psychology and culture come into play. We’re working on it.” For the head of Intercos, “aside from market vision, what matters the most is the ability to anticipate and innovate but also increased responsibilities within the company as well as the industrial response.” An industrial response concretely translated today in the field, with among others, the actual commissioning of the Brazilian plant with a production surface of 10,000 sqm, dedicated to the manufacture of the whole product range (powders, lipsticks, emulsions etc.), but also with the doubling of the production area of the Group’s Chinese factory (+ 12 000 sqm). “Industrial choices that also often mean making difficult decisions,” explains Ferrari, “but which are mostly driven by changes in demand. The latest example is the transfer of our pencil activity from Europe to Asia. Industrial strategies are not an exact and set science. Because the greatest asset of an industrialist remains his ability to quickly adapt to market changes. What was true yesterday may be less true today and totally different tomorrow. Today the market trend is prompting us to invest globally, including, for example, in the development and production of packagings, particularly in Asia.” To be continued..."
Crystalmoda: a new factory,"A new milestone for Dario Moretti, the CEO and main shareholder, who decided to fully devote himself to the development of Crystalmoda after recently selling to the Lumson Group his packaging activity, Modapack.  “Made in Italy, when it comes to cosmetic formulas is more than successful,” he says.  “In this field we have the industrial and human skills coupled with an almost ancestral expertise. And this is a well known fact abroad!” The newly completed 5,000 sqm factory can already produce some two million pieces per year of make-up powders. A figure which will jump to 25 million next year and more than 30 million in 2015.  “Powder is currently our core business,” explains Moretti, “but we can also rely on a production capacity of 8 tonnes/month for the production of lipgloss, mascara, and lipstick, among others.” Between 2014 and 2017, the financing plan is projected to inject each year some 500,000 euros. The factory is already GMP compliant and in the process of obtaining ISO standards.  “We are also about to integrate several new production machines,” adds Moretti.  “Demand is growing more and more. From 5 million euros in sales at the end of this year, our activities will enable us to exceed the 8 million euros mark next year. And this is only the beginning. Some foreign customers, with several of them in the United States are just waiting for our production capacities to grow.”"
Success paves the way for new ambitions at Alkos,"Alkos Cosmétiques, Intercosmétiques and Sagal merged into the Alkos Group in 2008, shortly before the financial crisis. The group then had to manage both structuring and the significant decline in the sector’s activity. However, today all lights are green in terms of turnover growth and results. This year the Alkos Group has exceeded their targets as sales have risen by +16 %, and their 2013 turnover should reach more than €43 million (€37.4 million in 2012). As for 2014, the aim is to maintain a two-digit growth, partly with the good results obtained on the cosmetic pencils market (+20 % compared to 2012), due to exports in particular, and with the success of Intercosmétiques with lipsticks, the Jumbo Twist Mania and new major launches (+15 %). Sagal has also taken off (+24 %) with their translucent soaps, among others. The group is now reaping both the benefits of the patient work done with activity structuring and integration, and “the results of the efforts made in quality and manufacturing, with two new site directors hired”, specifies Florence Lefeuvre, the Sales and Marketing Communications Director. The three entities that form the Alkos Group today were well known in their own specific sectors, yet the group’s identity remained to be defined when it was set up. “Our first task consisted in developing a commercial and marketing approach by relying on the three companies’ synergies. The group’s product offer is particularly rich, with full ranges in skincare and makeup, except for powders and varnish, and also comprises soaps and stick deodorants. It was an asset from the very beginning, but it all had to be structured”, Florence Lefeuvre explains. As soon as she took up her post in 2011, she got involved in implementing the commercial tools required for presenting and promoting a global offer. The company also invested in communication and participated in many trade shows to strengthen their reputation. As for sales, the Alkos Group has relied on the various assets of its three entities. “Beyond the synergies and complementarity of product portfolios, we mainly aim to develop manufacturing know-how for the global quality of our formulas, but also to focus on details, getting to know our customers, listening to them and meeting their specific needs”, adds Florence Lefeuvre. The development strategy also requires significant investments in the group’s strengths. Among the products concerned are lipsticks, for which the group has invested in a third hot filling line, cosmetic pencils, with a second, fully automatic filling line for plastic pencils to be inaugurated this month, and eyeliner pens, with the purchase of a second filling machine. All in all, more than €2 million were invested in 2013, and this pace is to be maintained in 2014, with the possible purchase of a third filling line for plastic pencils, and a second automatic filling line for waterproof retractable pencils. “What we want is to meet demand and be able to do credit to the markets we have won in the best conditions possible, with actual partnerships with our customers”, underlines Florence Lefeuvre. While some companies are leaving Europe, Alkos is proud to have restored profitability and achieved a two-digit growth, and has announced their teams will be strengthened as soon as the end of the year. “As producers of plastic and wooden cosmetic pencils for more than 50 years, our “made in France” mark guarantees quality and is thus more and more highlighted, affixed near the logos of French brands that listen to their customers and are more and more sensitive to it”, Florence Lefeuvre explains. The Alkos Group has thus reached their goals by “making different cultures merge in the same project”, stresses Dominique Vautier, CEO. Shareholders and customers trust the group, which can now look ahead and even consider a possible coherent acquisition in terms of product and/or geographic complementarity. The group is indeed still strongly focused on the French market, which globally represents about 70 % of their activity. To be continued…"
Jean Patou reinvents itself,"It was a kind of sleeping beauty. Since its acquisition by Procter & Gamble, the brand had gradually slipped off the radar of beautiful fragrance lovers. Then bought by British company Designer Parfums [1] in July 2011, Jean Patou now offers Joy Forever a modernized reinterpretation of the brand’s legendary fragrance Joy and relaunches three of its previous creations, Chaldée (1927), Eau de Patou (1976) and Patou pour Homme (1980). “The brand’s portfolio was so wealthy that we deemed not necessary to initiate a completely new creation,"" explained Bruno Cottards, Vice President. With this in mind, Designer Parfums chose to reinvent the brand by focusing its efforts on two issues: – the modernization of Joy , the best known and most emblematic fragrance of the brand, by offering a version for today’s women,
– the revival of some 50 fragrances created by Jean Patou, with the aim to launch three new fragrances per year. It took some time to restart the brand, which had been integrated into a major industry giant and thus needed some reorganisation.  “In particular, we had to fully reorganise the supply chain,"" said Bruno Cottards. The tricky task consisting in reviving the spirit of Joy into a new juice was entrusted to Thomas Fontaine, the new perfumer of this prestigious fragrance house where famous names such as Henri Alméras, Henri Giboulet, Jean Kerléo, and Jean-Michel Duriez have been working. With Joy Forever, Thomas Fontaine launches a fragrance “more accessible and better adapted to contemporary lifestyles."" Top notes feature bergamot and mandarin with galbanum.  The heart is made of marigold, rose de Mai and jasmine echo Joy but are complemented by iris and orange flower notes. Base notes feature: cedar-wood, sandalwood, amber and white musks. ""Thus, the cohabitation of Joy’s rose and jasmine is made more easily accessible. Joy Forever is a kind of initiation, which then may lead the consumer to test the original fragrance,” said Thomas Fontaine. Joy Forever comes into three sizes (30ml, 50ml and 75ml). It will be launched in the selective distribution network in approximately 1,000 points of sales in France. Joy Forever’s bottle was developed by Verreries Brosse, the cap by RPC France and the secondary cardboard packaging by Landerer (Autajon group). Jean Patou is also reintroducing three of its classic fragrances, which form the first part of its Heritage collection, thus attempting to reconnect with its roots and the tradition of French haute perfumery, but targeting the community perfumery enthusiasts. The three fragrances - Chaldée, Eau de Patou and Patou pour Homme - will be available in 100 ml bottles from November in France, in niche and high end perfumeries and at Le Printemps. The bottles of the Heritage collection were made by Saverglass, the wooden caps by Technotraf, the pumps were provided by Aptar and the secondary packaging cartons were manufactured by Prestige Packaging Industries (PPI)."
Topline Products: a plant in Europe within one year,"It is now certain, even if the details of the operation have yet to specify: Topline Products should get, within one year, its own production unit in Europe.  According to Topline Products, several options are being considered, including an acquisition or the building of a new unit.  The goals: to be closer to customers, to control production, costs, lead-time and quality. The operation should also help Topline to strengthen its positions on the skincare and fragrance markets. For this company, which was founded in 1975 as a trader of packaging, it will be the culmination of its transformation into a global manufacturer.  Topline Products, which is headquartered in Wayne, New Jersey, set up its first factory in 1995 in China.  The company, which now has more than 1,000 employees worldwide (speaking no less than 14 different languages), has sales and technical offices in Europe, the United States, Brazil, and Asia, as well as four production units in the United States (Dundee, Michigan), Mexico (Reynosa) and China (Tianjin and Shanghai). “We are strengthening our position as a global supplier, able to meet the demands of global customers,"" said Charles Chang, the founder and CEO of the company.  “Today, our core competency is the expertise in customized package executions, including plastic moulding (injection, bi-injection, injection blow moulding, extrusion blow moulding, in-mould-labelled packages), metal stamping, injected metal (zinc alloy and aluminum), finishes (hot-stamping, silk-screening, pad printing, metallization, anodization, electroplating, heat transfer film), rapid prototyping (in-house production tool and unit cavity tool development), cosmetic pens and other complex delivery systems.” In practice, Topline’s strength is to be able to transform the concept presented by the customer into a final industrial product.  “Most of our customers come with a design concept and entrust us to finalize and execute it,” added Charles Chang. Furthermore, Topline’s marketing and formulation teams can proactively contribute to the brand creation process to propose and advise clients on trends, choice of formulas and offer guidance on feasibility.   The company has its own team of R&D and formulation experts with full knowledge of the latest regulatory issues, and operates its own industrial sites dedicated to formulation and filling in Asia and North America, including assembly operations for secondary packaging. Since its beginning, Topline Products has focused on innovation and has invested in the development of its facilities.  In close partnership with brands, the company creates solutions that bring added value in terms of product delivery systems, functionality and differentiating design.  As of today, Topline Products has over 40 active patents worldwide. Among the latest innovations, let’s mention a patent pending compact with an innovative one hand action “push and slide” opening. This focus on innovation, combined with its industrial know-how, now allows the company to rely on a portfolio of prestigious clients such as Burberry Beauty, Lancôme, By Terry, YSL and many more."
"Rusi, the German firm is gaining momentum!","Premium Beauty News - We can say that you are now reaping the fruits of the reorganization work undertaken for the three past years. Klaus Sindel - Our growth has exceeded 7% last year and we expect 11% this year. And don’t forget that we inaugurated in Bechhofen, just a year ago our new 2,500 sqm production site which therefore comes in addition to the existing 6,500 sqm. And we will have finished building a new storage centre of 1,500 sqm in November. Main objective at the time, increase by 15% our production capacity for mascaras, lip gloss and eyeliners, and also further develop our lacquering line with a capacity of 15 to 20 million pieces per year (a 1.5 million euros investment). We also increased our decoration capacity (hot stamping, screen printing, pad printing, etc.) by about 30% (20% through the recovery of the industrial tool of Sun Creative Cosmetics and 10% by investing in new equipment). To date, we have thirty injection machines and a brand new 80-tonne press should be delivered to us in the coming days. Among the other consequences of this set of decisions, we worked on optimizing logistics flows, stepping up quality standards, reducing reaction time, increasing customer proximity and optimizing project management. All in all, one of our key strengths today at Bechhofen stands in the full integration of the manufacturing process. Premium Beauty News - How is your activity broken down between the different products you manufacture? Thomas Hübner - Today, we can say that we have a total production capacity of approximately 70 million pieces per year which is broken down between mascaras, lip gloss, lipstick tubes, and other products, but in which the Mascara has the major percentage. One of our latest innovations, to be launched in the coming days, our new “Beth Mascara”, a model that we will be showcasing at Luxe Pack Monaco and which suits perfectly the current trend for larger sizes (16-18 ml). Premium Beauty News - Can we speak of a revival of lipstick? Thomas Hübner - We can actually say that. We are starting to feel the benefits of the take over of Schmidt & Niedermeier in 2010. We can rely for this activity on more than 250 plastic injection moulds and Rusi invested some 350,000 euros to upgrade them. Demand is growing stronger. We have a production capacity of nearly 400,000 pieces per week. And, of course, we are working on new models coming from new pending patents."
"Pierre Miasnik, Fiabila “Be and stay one step ahead!” ","Premium Beauty News - Not everyone can claim being a nail polish manufacturer? Pierre Miasnik - When a market is growing strongly it always looks attractive from the outside and seems easy enough to tackle. But regardless of the country in which we carry out our activity, safety and regulatory aspects limit the possibilities of a high level of production. To produce a few dozen tonnes in a few hundred square meters is easily manageable but to produce several thousand tonnes in thousands of square meters requires getting authorizations, which are always difficult to obtain and result in particularly high investment costs. To ensure the full traceability, as required by regulations, of several hundred tons of flammable liquid every week, enables to understand how such amounts are reached. We were often asked to extend our business to other products, but we preferred using our investment capacity to strengthen our position on our market. Productivity, production capacity and product safety involve significant investments for a product, where profitability comes from volumes and to achieve these volumes you need to be particularly competitive. The important position that we hold in many markets with our French company and our subsidiaries have allowed us to validate sustainable sources of raw materials and to strengthen our purchasing at a global level. Today, the consolidated turnover and volumes achieved by Fiabila put us well ahead of the industry, not to mention our quality level recognized worldwide. Premium Beauty News - Practically and industrially speaking, where do you stand today? Pierre Miasnik - I was already given several opportunities to speak in your columns. And your readers already know part of the story. Examples include investments made on our site in Le Perray en Yvelines concerning high-speed filling lines (zero defects!) suitable for mass production. We can also mention the gradual replacement of our slower lines in our other site in Plaisir. We can also mention the opening of our second production site in the United States and the commissioning of our first filling line in China with our partner Shya Hsin, preceding the commissioning of a tinting line scheduled in September. Finally, I can tell you that we will be operating in Russia by the end of this year and that our future establishment in Brazil is rapidly progressing. Ah! I almost forgot... our new factory in Japan will also be operational by the end of 2014. Premium Beauty News - A progression that takes place in a very specific context. Pierre Miasnik - Quality and safety are and always have been decisive aspects for Fiabila. Our trade has evolved significantly in recent years. We have to constantly adapt ourselves every day. In a few months we had to significantly strengthen our regulatory support team. To meet the various legislatures around the world, we need very precise information. Do you know that we have to deal with more than 2,000 different raw materials, with have of them almost daily! The greater the concentration of our customers, the greater their requirements. Environmental, safety and quality aspects have become so strategic and vital that we have forced ourselves to build very performing teams in all these areas. To give you a picture, do you know that our industrial investments for environmental matters in our French units represented an amount exceeding 12 million euros over the past few months. But it is not just industrial investments. We have also invested heavily in men. A new Director of Operations has joined us. A new Marketing Director is being recruited. We also strengthened our team in the colour and product development department. It is very important today to anticipate marketing developments and thus, the industrial and logistical consequences they entail. It is all about managing the future in a more conceptual way."
Oriflame wants to boost sales through innovation and a better organization,"After experiencing a growth rate of nearly 15% per year during the 2000s, Oriflame saw its momentum stopped in its tracks by the 2008-2009 crisis. Since then, sales have stagnated, with a turnover approaching € 1.5 billion. To find a new lease of life, Oriflame has repositioned its brand under a new slogan “Your dreams - Our InspirationTM” and signed a contract of international representation with actress Demi Moore. But the Swedish giant specialized in the direct sales of beauty products, founded in 1967 by brothers Jonas and Robert af Jochnick, can also rely on other assets. Oriflame can first build on a strong capacity for innovation. Its R&D centre in Dublin, Ireland, designs each year more than 400 new products for the global market. Its 160 researchers and technicians from 14 different countries, have an accumulated experience of 927 years! Other strong point: an impressive sales force. Oriflame can rely on 3.4 million independent consultants (90% of which are women) located in more than sixty countries, including 1.8 million in its flagship market: CIS countries and the Baltic region. Oriflame has operations on every continent except North America. Recently the group set up a new remuneration scheme for its consultants in the CIS with the aim of boosting sales. “Oriflame wants to maintain its position in its flagship markets and increase its presence in Africa, Asia and Latin America,” explains Johan Rosenberg, Executive Vice President Global Marketing and R&D. The group’s business model makes it particularly suited to developing countries, where beauty products are less accessible due to an underdeveloped or ill-adapted distribution network. Among noteworthy launches planned for the month of September 2013, the new Ecollagen cream, which is based on natural ingredients originating from the Swedish countryside while taking advantage of the benefits of stem cell cultures. For Alain Mavon, Skin Research Director at Oriflame, “this allows using very little plant material and increases without limit research opportunities since even protected plants can be used without causing any damage to the existing flora.” Another novelty for the fall season, the new Colour Drop lipstick with a grape shaped like a water drop. According to Jonas Wramell, the Company’s Global Beauty Artistic Director, the idea was to replicate “the shape of the lips for a perfect application.” On the side of hair care, Oriflame has focused research on the “health” of the scalp. The new formula in the HairX shampoo was designed around a ginger derived component, 6-Gingerol, selected for its “anti-oxidant, soothing and purifying” properties. The group has also announced a series of measures to be implemented during the last quarter of 2013 and early 2014, with the aim to improve time to market, increase the efficiency of catalogues and promotional campaigns, while improving the company’s overall efficiency. Oriflame will first create four new sub-regional structures (Central Europe, Western Europe, Turkey, Africa) to take a better account of local specificities and particularly of the markets’ various degrees of maturity. In parallel, the EMEA structure will be reduced. In the same vein, the creation and production of product catalogues will be managed by the new sub-regions to better ensure their adaptation to the needs of the concerned markets. Other measures are aimed to streamline costs: a better distribution of responsibilities, a greater centralization of purchases at a global level, the further integration of information technology tools at the back office level. These efforts, according to the group should help generate savings of 15 to 20 million euros."
"IL Cosmetics, continues to invest","IL Cosmetics (International Lacquers, Luxcos, Interpack), a producer of nail polish and make-up products, also offering a turnkey service via Interpack is continuing its investments to cope with a significant growth of its operations. The group expects to increase twofold its turnover by 2016. IL Cosmetics has significantly surpassed its objectives over the past year with an above-market growth, particularly for nail polish, a product whose sales should remain robust. In this context, after an average growth exceeding 25% over the past five years, the Luxembourg Company expects to double its turnover by 2016 to reach 120 million euros, against 52 million in 2012 and a forecast of 63 million in 2013. To meet the increase in business, IL Cosmetics will continue its efforts in terms of investments. The group has acquired a new packaging plant, which will be equipped to be operational in early 2014 and which will help double its overall packaging capacity to reach 200 million units per year. In addition, consolidation in R&D is continuing. The number of employees dedicated to this activity was quadrupled in two years and will reach 35 people end of 2013. The research and development laboratory of International Lacquers is organized into specialized teams for each type of product: basic research for formulation, innovation, special effects associated with pearls and pigments, nail care, raw materials, colouring solutions. IL Cosmetics is making significant investments in R&D, is growing faster than the market and, as a service provider in the area of nail polish, now ranks world’s number two."
Nail polish: Major shifts!,"A series of announcements following, one may recall, the takeover, a few months ago, of one of the largest U.S. player in the industry, Kirker Enterprises, by the group, also American, RPM International.  New deal of the cards, concentrations, this sector continues to be highly coveted. And for good reason! The consumption of nail polish has exploded over the last ten years in the world but also in France.  The annual growth rates of this product are quite enough to make any entrepreneurs’ mouths water. We are witnessing a real “nail polish mania”, with an increasing number of buyers (20% of French women, for example), and with increasing quantities (2.4 units per buyer). On the side of the Intercos group, the takeover of its colleague, DropNail is not a surprise. Dario Ferrari, the CEO of the Italian group, had never made a secret of his interest in the sector. Nail polish remains an important niche in the make-up sector.  Drop Nail srl is actually a new player in nail polish who has established itself two years ago in the area of Crema.  Its 1,500 sqm production unit boasts to date, a production capacity of 1,800 tonnes/year or 180 million units/year. For Dario Ferrari, “with the arrival of this company specialized in the production of nail polish, we will be able to fully use the synergies that exist between us. DropNail will thus be able to benefit from both our global industrial presence (Europe, United States, Asia, Brazil), where we are going to invest in filling lines, and also from Intercos’ capacity for research and development which, as you know, is significant. As far as we are concerned, we can rely on a very effective industrial tool whose capacity is fort the time being totally satisfying. We can also take advantage of their good commercial presence in Brazil.” As far as the French group Fareva is concerned, Bernard Fraisse, its CEO, considers that the acquisition of Chromavis mostly enable the company “to play a significant role in make-up with the recognized expertise of Chromavis in this field.”  Indeed, he adds, “nail polish only accounts for 30% of its turnover.”  In the future, Chromavis will be in charge of the group’s make-up activity.  “There are many synergies, like in particular a complementarity of the customer base or the industrial sites of Fareva and the sales locations of Chromavis. In addition, through this acquisition, Fareva clearly state its objectives of being present and to invest the world over in innovation and R&D.” As for the two other main players in the market among which the French company Fiabila which achieves the biggest worldwide consolidated turnover in nail polishes, but also with the Luxembourg-based company IL Cosmetics, investments have been on going over the last few months. In early 2012, Pierre Miasnik, the CEO of Fiabila had announced the opening of a new packaging site of 3,500 sqm in France, in Le Perray en Yvelines, hosting both a filling area equipped with high-speed filling lines but also two storage areas, one for packaging items and the other for flammable raw materials. In the United States, the company had just acquired a second plant due to be operational in May 2013 with on top of it, an extension of the site in January next year. Two joint actions, which have enabled the French company to increase twofold its operations across the Atlantic. Third action, in India where Fiabila just completed the construction of its second factory (3,500 sqm). And eventually, just one year ago, the French firm confirmed, through the voice of its CEO Pierre Miasnik, the establishment of a manufacturing and packaging unit for nail polishes in Kunshan, China. A commissioning which was effective at the beginning of this year. An operation carried out as part of a joint venture with the Shya Hsin group. And Pierre Miasnik insists: “our investments only concern nail polish and no other product!” For its part, IL Cosmetics has also accelerated the pace of its investments with, among others, the creation of a new entity in the United Kingdom and an increased in R&D investments. The Luxembourg-based group, is building on the sharp increase of its activity (+ 25% in 2012, and more than 20% on average over the past years) to continue the investment program set up in 2012. The R&D division has seen its investments increase threefold in 2013 and the group has built a new laboratory in Luxembourg. In addition, the production site in Luxembourg was expanded with a new manufacturing unit to address the company’s increase in activity."
Chemicos Creations : from eyeliners to mascaras,"Premium Beauty News - Eighteen years ago when the company was created, it specialized in the production of eyeliners.  Katsutaka Hattori - Yes ! Since our founding, in 1996, we have endeavoured to create the BEST in cosmetics and cosmetic packaging, and are particularly proud of our eyeliner and eyeliner packaging. We have now many formulations for pen-type liquid eyeliner, and can also create an eyeliner to the specifications of our customers. We produce packaging for pen-type liquid eyeliners for every woman’s convenience and preference. Further, we have also a wide selection of basic skin care line packaging, as well as complete colour cosmetics packaging, including lipsticks, glosses, eye shadows, nail polishes, mascaras, foundations, concealers, and tattoo colours.All of our containers are sold with or without inks as finished products. We have worked hard to develop inks which are greatly compatible with our packaging systems and our inks are highly recommended to be used with our packaging products. Premium Beauty News - One of the strong points that you put forward concerning your eyeliners is their formula. Katsutaka Hattori - Our eyeliner contains carbon black (pigment) which is approved by the US FDA. High technical polymer formulation dries rapidly without blur. Thanks to the characteristics of pigment, recoating is unnecessary. Among the main advantages of our formula: – High-molecular weight polymer realizes instant adhesion and coating.
– It stays on even when exposed to sweat, sebum and water.
– The solid line will stay on for 24 hours but can be taken off easily.
– It doesn’t require removers or cleansing lotions.
– It can be removed easily without damaging the eyelids. Premium Beauty News - The “health” aspect for the skin and eyes is an essential part of your approach. Katsutaka Hattori - Absolutely! Standard eyeliners have been utilizing dye which is easy to formulate. Caused by the characteristics of dye, repeating usage causes spotty skin and dullness. This results to dullness and one of the aging phenomena. Since our eyeliners never utilize the dye, it is an epoch-making eyeliner which does not use dye for skin. Our eyeliners have been utilizing only safe pigments for make up on the skin. Among the other advantages of our eyeliners range is their ability to be easily removed. As for the standard water-proof eyeliner, the disadvantage is that it takes time to wash off and damage the eyelids. Rubbing friction with remover, cleansing cream and lotion destroys your muscle fibre. Our product adopts special polymer soluble in warm water with beauty soap and facial cleansing lotion. Resistant to water, sweat and tears, but easy to wash off. Premium Beauty News - You have just got started in the production of mascaras. A feature of your group, the mastery of formulas. Katsutaka Hattori - Yes, at present we succeeded the development of mascaras using special silk powder which always have been requested. The special powder is a kind of protein included in fine silk that is harmless to human body and friendly ingredient. Miraculous harmony of silk powder and mascara created a marvellous mascara. Premium Beauty News - What is your business strategy for the coming years? Katsutaka Hattori - The Japanese market represents about 50% of our market, which is a lot. Exports sales are dominated by the U.S. market with over 70%. It is clear that our expertise can be of interest in many other parts of the world, especially France."
Nippon Shikizai: A new plant in Japan in 2014 and major investments in France too!,"Premium Beauty News - A few words to start on your group. Kouji Okumura - Nippon Shikizai started its business in the 1930s as a manufacturer of pigments for facial cosmetics and is now one of Japan’s most innovative cosmetic providers of research, development and product manufacturing technology. In addition to across-the-board manufacturing capabilities, comprehensive quality control and an unrivalled commitment to research and development, we bring together a unique group of specialists dedicated to providing cosmetic companies, worldwide, a comprehensive and total business solution. Globally, we have more than 180 clients including several larger-sized cosmetic producers in domestic Japanese market and overseas markets. Premium Beauty News - You are one of the few Japanese companies in the cosmetics sector to have taken the initiative to invest commercially in Europe by acquiring a French company, and you will continue investing.
 Kouji Okumura - France is the leading country in the cosmetic field where numbers of beauty/ fashion brands and prestigious global manufacturers originated from. We believe that we can introduce our high-quality and value-added products into such sophisticated market with the help of the clients who understand our quality. In 2000, we acquired the French company, Thépenier Pharma Industry, headquartered in Paris, as a 100% owned subsidiary, in a move to expand operations internationally.  Thépenier is an integrated pharmaceutical manufacturer; that primarily focuses on the manufacturing on assignment. Production includes drugs, sanitary goods and cosmetics. Thépenier supplies contract-manufactured goods to major pharmaceutical companies, mostly in Europe. This enables us to carry out internationally targeted product development and global marketing. We have indeed planned to invest significantly to expand the plant’s production capabilities by the middle of next year. The interest for us to take over Thépenier Pharma Industry stood mainly in its ability to guarantee us a production tool at the top in terms of quality production and of compliance to standards. Levels required for pharma production enable to develop ourselves in total peace of mind in the cosmetics sector. Premium Beauty News - What are the main strengths of your group in today’s competitive environment? Kouji Okumura - Our strategy is built on four pillars:  - We foster creativity and technical expertise to supply outstanding products that can proudly bear your name. 
 - Our uncompromising commitment to quality and our flexibility are the pillars of our business success. 
 - We strive to be a major global player and the most innovative and cosmetics contract manufacturer. 
 - We seek to enrich lives with formulas that deliver maximum sensory delight. I want to emphasize on what makes the difference between us and our competitors. This lies in our ability to innovate, our customer service, our level of quality but also in our competitiveness in terms of prices. We definitely position ourselves in bespoken and upscale products and as a highly reliable supplier who is loyal and trustworthy, to its clients in terms of quality assurance and delivery schedule. Premium Beauty News - Make-up products are important in your portfolio. Kouji Okumura - That’s true. Still today foundation products represent 25% of our business, but they are closely followed by mascaras and eyeliners (15%) and lipsticks (12%). We offer a broad selection of formulas to beautify one’s complexion: make-up bases, concealers, liquid & cream foundations, powder foundation and blushes. These formulas feature outstanding textures, colours and make-up properties, while blending into the skin for a natural and lasting finish. Mousse foundation, stick concealer, dual-stick foundation and cream to powder compact foundation are just a few of the many innovative cosmetic products manufactured by Nippon Shikizai. Our lip formulas include a wide selection of lipsticks (matte, sheer, glossy, long-lasting, 100% natural, and others), lip balms and glosses. Our cutting-edge production facilities allow various design options: standard or slim sticks, back or front injection, metal or silicone moulds, double lipsticks (2 colours or with a treatment core), glosses containing patterns or swirls. To complement these products, we also offer lip liners in mechanical pencils. Furthermore, our eye make-up collection consists of a broad range of formulas: eye shadows (pressed powder, liquid, cream, cream to powder or solid), mascaras, eyeliners (gel, solid, liquid pen or pencil) and eyebrow make-up. Premium Beauty News - Asides from these investments in France, you also plan to invest in Japan in a new production unit, which will be operational next year? Kouji Okumura - The construction of the new production unit will be soon completed, to start operations by February 2014. It will allow us to increase our filling capacity and, if all goes according to the investment plan, we will also install some production equipment."
Red Of View: “Small is beautiful”,"Premium Beauty News - You have just decided to come out into the open? Caterina Bondioli - You can say it that way, yes... We attended our first show this year by exhibiting at Cosmoprof Bologna and we plan to increase our presence in trade shows next year. The reason for this is simple. Our know-how is now sufficiently recognized and our customer base strong enough for us to offer our creative and production capacity to other actors in the make-up market. We have activities in every segment, mascaras, foundations, lipsticks, lipgloss... Premium Beauty News - You presented a few weeks ago a whole new range of products.  Caterina Bondioli - We can start with our cleansing oil Soft Tidy, a blend of natural oils, rich in botanical actives, and natural derived esters. It preserves the delicate skin balance providing a thin barrier while removing make up and impurities. It is enriched by desert date oil (rich in linoleic and oleic fatty acid, omega-3 and omega-9 with moisturizing and emollient properties, and also in saponins that confer an anti-inflammatory activity), derived from first cold pressing of the kernel of the Desert Date. We can also talk about our lipstick Satli’, which moves toward a satin soft reflection offering high coverage and long lasting performances. Actually, the use of selected pigments which are particularly adhesive thanks to their coating treatment, and the soft film formed by a special resin, permit a longer stay-on on your lips compare to a classic formula. The addition of a special derived amino acids emollient balances the richness of powders to avoid a dry skin feeling. This emollient is derived from glutamic acid, natural fatty acid, and phytosterol. It forms lamella liquid crystals identical to ceramide working as an intercellular lipids as well as having high water holding capacity. Because of its high skin affinity, it starts to moisture as soon as it is applied. As for our blush, Cheek & Chic, it is our offer for a natural and healthy glow: a creamy blush presented in a poured form. Easy to blend, it imparts a silky shade with a weightless finish. The formula contains a balanced mixture of esters with emollient properties and a pleasant after skin feel. A sophisticated microsphere powder runs on to the skin making it extremely easy to apply. The elastomer powder provides a matte appearance as well as cushioning effect. Premium Beauty News - Your know-how in the manufacturing of foundation is important. Caterina Bondioli - With the foundation Elaskin Photolite, we have created a simple and sophisticated foundation. Its outstanding properties come from a compound, a Photochromatic Titanium Dioxide, which can change the skin tone according to the intensity of UV light. The colour of the compound becomes darker upon UV light irradiation restoring its original colour intensity without irradiation. It can change the skin complexion according to the light intensity avoiding an over whitish effect when outdoors (while indoors, your skin tone is perfect). An hydrolyzed elastin solution enriches the formula with regenerating and moisturizing properties. Soft and lubricious boron nitride, in a water soluble version, gives a smooth and seductive touch. It’s a new formula to brighten your face. Premium Beauty News - Not to mention mascara... Caterina Bondioli - The mascara Sericil is an extremely soft and creamy mascara which intensifies lash volume creating deeper-looking lashes. It glides on easily making lashes more eye catching, luxurious and healthier. It is formulated with sericin, which was transformed by ionic reticulation into a cationic form, promoting a conditioning effect on lashes. Sericin strongly binds to lashes, acting as an adhesive, which cements the damaged cuticles for a darker and radiant look."
Laboratoires BEA: focus on growth,"Headquartered since 1992 in Forcalquier, in the Alpes de Haute Provence (Southern France), Laboratoires Bains and Aromas (BEA) are tapping into the continued interest from French and foreign consumers in Provence inspired cosmetics. Specialized in the manufacturing of personal care products (face, body, hair), whether conventional, natural or organic (Ecocert, NOP or Cosmos certified), but also of soaps, colognes, candles and home fragrances, Laboratoires BEA employ 80 people and have achieved a turnover of 12 million euros in 2012.

In total, the company is investing around 1.2 million euros to support its development and the modernization of manufacturing facilities, including an upgrade and increase of production capacities on the two manufacturing facilities (including the site of 9000 sqm site in Forcalquier) and the acquisition of new packaging equipment. About 65% of Laboratoires BEA’s sales are made abroad and the company wants to strengthen its position in emerging markets, particularly in Asia and the Middle East. ""Today, the United States are our first export market,"" says Julie Le Bacquer, marketing manager.  ""For the second consecutive year, we participated in the Beautyworld Middle East tradeshow in Dubai and we’ll also exhibit at Cosmoprof Asia, in Hong Kong, in addition to our participation in European trade fairs: Cosmetic Business in Munich and Beyond Beauty in Paris. The Provencal origin of our products is a big asset. This is true in the United States, of course, but also in Asia and the Middle East."" In Dubai, the company introduced Aqua Intense, a new collection of four bath and body care products made from lavender, a typical ingredient in Provence-inspired cosmetics, and from Alpine glaciers water: – Essential Water Pearls, that dissolve in the bath,
– a sulphate-free Foaming Water, for the shower and bath,

Schwan Cosmetics: two new formulas and a new packaging,"Premium Beauty News - Themed “Surprising Application”, Schwan Cosmetics will present two new formulas at Make Up in Paris! Jörg Karas -  Yes, as you know our formulas continuously keep pushing boundaries and offer our clients great opportunities to address the consumers with an extra value. One concept we’ll show will be a new generation of kajal pencil featuring a unique waterline application and the other a new eyeshadow texture with a beautiful powdery finish. The unexpected and novel application properties of these two new formulas will surprise consumers and customers alike. Another formula novelty at the show will be a new lip pencil with an astonishing velvety matte finish. Premium Beauty News - In term of packaging also? Jörg Karas - In terms of packaging, one of the new items from Schwan Cosmetics will be a highly innovative mechanical packaging specifically designed for absolute precision. It comes with two new state-of-the-art formulas for lip and eye with fantastic application and wear properties. The new must-have for your daily make up. Last but not least there will be a new sharpenable pencil presented that is simply elegant, puristic and classy. Premium Beauty News - Generally speaking, your philosophy in term of R & D is influence by the trends? Jörg Karas - In the sector of pencils our position is clearly to define trends or to provide unique application properties in formerly unknown formats. Where others just provide pencils, we provide more. Our specific product properties are supported by up-to-date marketing ideas through monthly mail sets and complete promotion packages. Our regular trend reports provide information on current sector trends and detailed studies of consumer preferences.

Premium Beauty News - Recently, it was the birthday of a famous product of Schwan Cosmetics? Jörg Karas - 25 years ago, “Addition”, the very first slim cosmetic pencil with a twist mechanism, was developed. The technique of pouring lead mass directly into the pencil’s plastic case was at that time considered revolutionary and generated many followers throughout the industry. To this day this eye- and lipliner is one of the most manufactured products at our global locations and a must have to any modern woman. With our unique formula technology and constant innovations Schwan keeps the position as leading global manufacturer in this sector. To meet the demanding requirements of application and wear characteristics of modern formulas and to stay at the top, it is imperative to continuously push manufacturing- and casting technology further ahead. This was also one of the reasons to invest 5 million euro last year in the reconstruction of the cosmetics factory in Heroldsberg. Together with the “birthday boy” this is where the company now produces various other very successful products under the most modern conditions."
Faber-Castell Cosmetics will inaugurate its new plant in Brazil next month,"Premium Beauty News - Crisis, what crisis? We are tempted to ask ourselves when we analyse the progression of your group in the cosmetic segment. Stefano Castelletti - There is no magic wand! We have worked hard in recent years and months on our costs to improve our productivity and to develop new products. And it’s working! Remember, in 2011 we started with the product concept “BRUSH-ON!”, our Liquid Applicator with a unique bristle brush for gels and emulsions. This airtight packaging is freshly activated with each click thus preventing the formulas from drying out. At Cosmoprof we presented it as “FLASH LASH”, a long-lasting brush-on top coat for lashes in flashy metallic colours with multi-dimensional sparkles. Another packaging to mention is our PVC-free, airtight and sharpenable Plastic Pencil in Slim and Jumbo. This packaging allows creamy formulations with excellent glide that blend smoothly and then transform to a lightweight finish that doesn’t crease or melt away. We presented highly pigmented eyeshadow colours with the concept name “UNDERWATER LOVE”, which highlights the performance power of a 16-hours waterproof formula that withstands tough waves and gruelling workouts. Premium Beauty News - Before going into the details of this dynamics of new product launches, can you tell us more on the drivers behind this growth? Stefano Castelletti - In fact, to be honest, we were pleasantly surprised by this growth in Europe. It was in line with our expectations, that is to say “strong” in Brazil. And it was not up to our expectations in the United States. Concerning Europe, we can say that it was boosted by brands that are changing the world of make-up with a strategy that was both dynamic and very aggressive in terms of marketing and sales and who attracted mostly the younger generations. We were able to present a full set of services and products well suited to this type of demand, with a both innovative and demanding quality and service offer. Concerning Brazil and this is no surprise, this country remains extremely dynamic on the make-up market and, as you know, we have the huge advantage of having our own fully integrated production chain. Premium Beauty News - What will be the impact of this new plant in Brazil on your overall production capacity? Stefano Castelletti - We will be doubling our production capacity of cosmetic pencils in this country through the construction of a new building.

Arcancil Paris confirms its growth objectives and invests in digital,"Premium Beauty News - At the time when FSI Régions and Oséo acquired a stake in your company, you had set ambitious development goals for Arcancil Paris. What is the situation like today? Anne Delleur -  Our goal to strengthen Arcancil Paris at all levels, particularly by reinforcing its distribution in France and by doubling its export turnover in three years time is coming true. Our sales have jumped by 60% between April 2012 and April 2013. In France, we have doubled the number of our shops over 2012 and we have also doubled our sales force. We have opened new markets abroad, like Hong Kong, Cambodia or Kazakhstan, and we are in the launch phase in Korea, Indonesia and China. Throughout our small company, we manage to achieve a controlled growth rate in France and abroad. Premium Beauty News - Your performance in France is particularly impressive in a mature, very complex and highly competitive market environment. Anne Delleur - Our growth in France (+30%), in France is one of our greatest sources of satisfaction. We owe it to the expertise of our teams, to rigorous product developments and the importance we place on the quality of services granted to our relationship with our distributors. As part of our partnership with French retail chain Beauty Success, we have opened 50 outlets in 5 months time. We also concluded an agreement with Beauty Success for the training of their sales personnel to enable them to gain a better understanding of make-up. As with all our clients, we also insist on logistics to minimize our distributors’ stocks. This implies, in particular, anticipating launches of new products to avoid returns. We rely on these assets to continually strengthen ourselves in France. Arcancil Paris has also entered Leclerc Group’s “Une heure pour soi” perfumery chain stores. Premium Beauty News - How does the Arcancil Paris brand manage to find its place in a selective network where large chain stores rely heavily on their own brands? Anne Delleur - Unquestionably, private labels or brands with networks of their own like Kiko, have changed the landscape of the French market. Only the best brands have managed to come unscathed. Arcancil Paris was among those thanks to its strong points: Eyes and price accessibility. To take the example of our partnership with Beauty Success, we are treated like a differentiating brand, in parallel with the own brand of the store. Our offerings are complementary: Our strong point is the eyes, with over 60% of our catalogue addressing this segment, which has been in the brand’s DNA since 1935. Moreover, we work together on our launch plan to generate incremental growth. Premium Beauty News - What are your priorities in terms of international development? Anne Delleur -  After our successful come back to Europe, South America and the Middle East, our main priority now is Asia, which has become Arcancil Paris’ growth driver with ranges dedicated to the eyes, complexion and lips, developed specifically for these markets, following the regional customisation strategy we successfully optimized for our ranges in the Middle East from 2010. Premium Beauty News - Your third growth driver is digital? Anne Delleur -  This is one of the pillars of our communication strategy, we spend on it over 40% of our communication budget in 2013. We have completely redesigned the visual and editorial identity of our e-commerce web site www.arcancil.com, available in six languages (Chinese, French, English, Spanish, Portuguese, and soon in Arabic) to embody the Parisian chic. This new breath of life is inspiring a new corporate image, with trendier and more sensual visuals. We are also present on social networks and we develop make-up tutorials with an international focus. During the redesign of our e-commerce website, particular attention has been paid to highlighting products on the site: HD photos, choices of colours, opinions of online users, products composition, link to social networks. Every effort has been made to provide comprehensive and transparent information to consumers of the brand and in order to create a real Arcancil Paris community. The hosts of events organized with the famous make-up Artist Morgane Hilgers, our brand ambassador for the past two years, will be relayed on the website and on social networks."
"Italy, new ambitions for the Polo Cosmesi","The Italian association Polo Tecnologico della Cosmesi, which up to now only included Italian cosmetic companies located mainly in the surroundings of the city of Crema - about forty kilometres south of Milan - decided at its eighth General Assembly last week to take a new step. At the instigation of its President, Mr. Matteo Moretti, the ambition of the association is now to become an association representing the entire Italian industry of the cosmetic sector, thus covering the whole Italian territory. To note among current members of the Executive Board of the association, companies like Lumson, AL.MA Cosmetics, Omnicos Group, Sabrix, E.P.S Group, San Cosmetics, Regi, Emme Pere. Among the main actions undertaken since the creation of the Polo in 2005, the joint presence of member companies at trade shows. Eventually, among the objectives set out at the General Assembly, the set up of a new charter that would be both technical and ethical for all members with the implementation in the end of a quality label. Also planned the implementation of a specialized professional training cycle on “colour” complemented in the end by the issuance of a Master in Cosmetology with the partnership of Bicocca, a University in Milan."
Aircos: new textures,"Premium Beauty News - You announced just a year ago the implementation of a new operational internally developed technology for the injection of make-up products. What is the situation like today? Eric Merville - This technology using both our expertise as a formulator and injector was 100% developed internally. We will be in an industrial production stage this year for products marketed in 2014. This new process enables to not “traumatize” the ingredients (in particular pigments and nacres) and to thus obtain an amazing smoothness and brightness. Premium Beauty News - You will be attending in a few weeks MakeUp in Paris. What will be the main highlights in terms of product lines? Especially concerning your Spring / Summer 2013 range? Eric Merville - Among other innovations, Aircos will showcase on the occasion of this show its new “Cashmere” textures obtained from the IPM process. These textures have an amazingly thin, silky and airy touch. They will be made available for both complexion and eyeshadows. Premium Beauty News - You were announcing last year the strengthening of both your R&D structure and full service activity. Have the months that have just passed been profitable? Eric Merville -  Regarding R&D, we have actually reinforced our team to reconcile innovation and comply with our commitments; we known that these two qualities do not always go well together! Concerning full service, with the increasingly demanding market, it was logical for us to adapt to it; it must be recalled that when Aircos refers to full service, it concerns 100% industrial Aircos solutions. Premium Beauty News - What will have been the other industrial investments made during the last twelve months and what are those scheduled in the coming months? Eric Merville - In our injection factory, an automated injection and assembly line for compacts was developed in 2012. For our make-up factory in Romorantin a strong increase in our manufacturing, compaction and filling capacity was observed in 2012. 2013 will be dedicated to IPM with the development (always in-house) of an automated high capacity machine."
Surya Brasil expands its international distribution,"With 250 employees worldwide, Surya Brasil does not have the size of giants such has O Boticário or Natura, but the compaby now ranks among the Brazilian cosmetics manufacturers that are the most successful on foreign markets. And the comparison always makes smile Wanda Malhotra who now runs the business founded by her mother.  “We cannot compare ourselves to these giants.  Our products are completely different, we are not operating on the same market segments,” she says. While Surya Brasil has been concerned with ecology and naturalness since foundation (the brand was created in 1995), it is again by remaining loyal to its principles that the company has been successful at home and on export markets.  Today, Surya Brasil is leading the Brazilian natural hair colour market, in particular thanks to it historical products based on hena. Today, the company is present in 32 countries on all continents, and its products are available on 95% of the U.S. territory, in particular thanks to its distributor, the retail chain store specialized in natural products, Whole Foods Market.  In order to better serve this market, where its sales grew by +53% in 2012, Surya Brasil will open a manufacturing facility in the USA in 2014. For Wanda Malhotra there is no doubt that this success stands on Surya Brasil’s natural and ethical positioning. “We are not growing thanks to the financial support of a big group, but because our customers appreciate our products and because of our credibility in the natural segment,” she says. Since its foundation, Surya Brasil has been focusing on natural ingredients and engaging various actions to support local communities. For its supply, the company has its own plantations, but also relies on Amazonian communities with which it strives to build a fair trade relationship. In order to settle the credibility that is sometimes lacking to some Brazilian brands on these issues, Surya Brasil has invested massively in certifications.  Thus, Surya Brasil is only Brazilian company proposing Vegan certified cosmetic products, that is to say without animal by-products.  Some of the products are also certified organic by Ecocert and Cosmebio.  Eventually, cardboard packaging are certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). As far as packaging is concerned, Surya Brasil emphasizes partnerships with raw material and packaging suppliers that develop their business strategy taking into account social and environmental responsibility. The company requires its suppliers to guarantee the origin and sustainability of their products.  All the packs must be recyclable; some of them may also be composted.  Thus, the jars of the skincare products of the Amazônia Preciosa line are made from coconut fibre and are 100% biodegradable. A range of strong assets on which the Brazilian company will continue to build in order to further expand its international distribution, now one of its key priorities."
Luxury beauty: L’Oréal redoubles efforts in China,"L’Oréal Luxe has led the way for luxury beauty in China since it first introduced Lancôme to Chinese consumers in 1993. Twenty years and ten luxury brands later (and soon 11 with the upcoming launch of Yves Saint Laurent Beauté), this foresight has paid off.  Today, L’Oréal Luxe is the most dynamic of the major luxury cosmetics groups in China with a growth of 1.3 times the market. To meet success in China, the division relies on the understanding of local needs. Thus, L’Oréal Luxe has been able to adapt its offering to the cultural habits, texture preferences and skin care routines of Chinese women and men, providing them with iconic, tailor-made premium products like Giorgio Armani’s Crema Nera Extrema and Helena Rubinstein’s Life Pearl Cellular. Chinese consumers’ penchant for ingredients used in traditional Chinese medicine has also inspired L’Oréal’s formulations, as seen in the Énergie de Vie range by Lancôme which uses precious root extracts of rhodiola, gentian and wild yam. This a deep understanding and insight of the Chinese consumer and the specificities of Chinese skin and hair are made possible by the Group’s long-term investment in Research and Innovation, creating research hubs all over the world, like the one in Pudong, Shanghai, to be ever closer to its consumers. The launch of new brands like Yves Saint Laurent  on the Chinese market will further enhance the existing L’Oréal Luxe portfolio, allowing the group to meet the needs of Chinese women and men across age, economic and lifestyle categories. Thus, Chinese luxury beauty shopper can choose from rich European heritage brands like Lancôme and Giorgio Armani, disruptive American brands like Kiehl’s and Clarisonic as well as Asian gems like Shu Uemura or Yue Sai - the local brand that is based on high-tech extraction methods of traditional Chinese medicine and emblematic of “invented in China, for China”. Despite the anticipated slowdown of Chinese growth, L’Oréal still considers China as the main foremost growth driver for its luxury division. “The most beautiful expression of L’Oréal Luxe brands is in China.  Our brands have flourished and we have consistently outperformed the market growth for the past 10 years. Our desire and commitment is to continue investing in the development of the luxury beauty segment in China, growing our Luxe offering and leading the way in innovation and retail,” says Nicolas Hieronimus, President, L’Oréal Luxe. China has, in turn, provided L’Oréal Luxe the opportunity to reinvent itself and redefine its brands to cater to the beauty needs of a new generation of Chinese consumers. “The exigencies of the market have challenged and inspired each of L’Oréal’s Luxe brands to constantly raise the bar in terms of product offerings, distribution, retail and service excellence as well as creative communications campaigns,” adds the company. “Chinese consumers are at the heart of L’Oréal’s focus and energies,” details Jean-Paul Agon, Chairman and CEO, L’Oréal Group, said.  “A potential 250 million new Chinese consumers will be using L’Oréal’s products in the next 10 to 15 years, making China the number one contributor to our ambition of winning 1 billion new consumers and to our strategy of universalization. A significant portion of these consumers will be recruited by our Luxe brands, the segment where L’Oréal has historically led the market and where it will continue to influence the shape of its future.”"
Star Colour Laboratories: An English SME that wants to carve a place for itself!,"Starting point for the Star Colour Laboratories: six employees including Kirsty Simmons, who were made redundant during 2010 when the company they worked at, was taken over by its main competitor. A bleak outlook at the time for this small group of colleagues. The only solution being to start their own business with the help of an investor. On October 2010, the project is underway: Located in a building of 500 sqm Star Colour Laboratories sees the light and releases its first productions. 2 ½ years later, the situation of the company is more than promising. The company produces 80% of make-up products (powders, mascaras, eyeliners, lipsticks, foundations, etc.) and 20% of skin-care products (BB creams, CC creams, etc.). “Our passion, explains Simmons, is to create products which perform outstandingly and are a pleasure to use. We pride ourselves on being innovative and versatile in the development and production of a wide range of products – traditional, natural, paraben-free, synthetic-free."" The company’s current portfolio of clients includes established colour cosmetic, household brand names and small independent businesses alike. “With many combined years of experience in the industry, we have acquired expertise in new product formulation for an extensive range of categories, and in particular exceptional knowledge of colour matching. We aim to work to understand particular requirements and specifications to ensure that formulations are innovative and effective, creating cutting edge formulations even to the most demanding of specifications.” Star Colour Laboratories has the expertise to develop formulations or product lines specific to the requirement.  “Skincare, toiletries and the colour cosmetic market is constantly evolving. We ensure we keep abreast of the latest developments and are proactive in researching new raw materials. All our raw materials are sourced with great care to ensure that the products we manufacture are of a consistently high standard. Microbiological testing is conducted by external accredited testing facility to ensure independent certification of the final product. Stability and compatibility trials are conducted in house over a twelve week period. We ensure compliance with all the relevant regulatory requirements such as the European Directive and REACH. Our services include advice on labelling/packaging requirements (e.g.: INCI, PAO), the compilation of a Product Information File and coordination of all microbiological testing and challenge testing. We offer filling, capping, labelling and batch coding. Our skilled work force has experience in filling, assembly, pack-off and labelling of a variety of componentry, giving total quality and flexibility in both long and short runs,” adds Kirsty Simmons. Future investments planned for this year: a new tube filling line and a new mascara line."
“Made in France” luxury beauty drives L’Oréal growth,"If L’Oréal’s global growth was stronger than that of the worldwide cosmetics market in 2012, it is partly due to the Group’s luxury division. In 2012, L’Oréal Luxe posted the group’s finest performance with growth of 8.3%. According to the group, this growth higher than that of the selective cosmetics sector at 6.3%, stands on an “in-depth understanding of consumers and a portfolio of prestigious brands, most of which affirm their ‘Made in France’ attributes, synonymous with luxury around the world.” The largest share of fragrances and cosmetics sales now comes from export. While several emerging countries like South Africa, Indonesia and a number of Central Asian countries have become players on the luxury market, China is where it’s really happening. Chinese consumers accounted for one quarter of luxury purchases in 2012. A large affluent middle class (estimated at 280 million households by 2020, or twice that of 2011) and the luxury groups’ recent development of retail networks explain this phenomenon. The Middle East is also a market with strong growth potential for luxury brands, cosmetics in particular, and the American continent also shows promising results, especially in fragrances. However, the growth of the global luxury market and its diversification imply to adapt industrial resources. The key issue, according to L’Oréal, being to satisfy a variety of consumer desires for luxury goods all over the world that meet the same quality standards. “This approach targets excellence from the design phase to the point-of-sale in an environment of increased buying power driven by the emergence of a clientele seeking ultra-luxury goods,” explains the group. To meet this growing demand for luxury goods around the world and to satisfy aspirations for unique, exceptional products, the L’Oréal Group combines artistic craftsmanship with industrial excellence. Most often, the challenge is to succeed in combining image with quality and a concern for detail with mass production. The Lancôme fragrance “La Vie est Belle” illustrates this control: its pack alone required 5 phases for a launch production of 2.6 million units. However, L’Oréal must also satisfy the expectations of a demanding clientele looking for products that are constantly more precious and unique. This segment is characterised by very limited series and may be comparable to hand craftsmanship; Armani’s “La Femme Cristal” fragrance, produced in 100 unique, engraved, numbered pieces, is a perfect example. Each bottle, selling for 5000 euros, was produced by the Cristallerie Royale de Saint Louis which truly demonstrates the extent of its talent here: a hand-blown crystal droplet containing the perfume inserted into a hand-chiselled 10-faceted crystal shell crafted by the Meilleurs Ouvriers de France masters. This dual market reality is why L’Oréal Luxe uses Operations as an essential advantage in serving the growth of its brands and their ambitions.  The European industrial and logistics excellence centre was created for this purpose in 2009 in the North-Picardie region. With their specialisation by technology, the three sites that compose it are genuine “excellence centres”. Its organisation is based on the specialisation of each of the three production plants that compose it. The Sicos site (Caudry) specialises in emulsion technologies for skin care products, mascara and foundation. In Fapagau (in Gauchy, Aisne dept.) production is dedicated to fragrances. While the Lassigny plant in the Oise department produces anhydrous make-up (Lipstick, Gloss, Powders and Varnish) and custom-made fragrances.  According to L’Oréal, “this specialisation by technology ensures the level of expertise and innovation required to meet the demanding brand standards and this strategy is why L’Oréal Luxe is one of the highest ranking in the cosmetics industry.” Each year, L’Oréal Luxe technical development creates 1500 new products for the Lancôme, Armani, Yves Saint-Laurent, Biotherm, Helena Rubinstein, Diesel, Cacharel, Victor & Rolf, Stella McCartney and Maison Martin Margiela brands.  This centre and its staff of 80 play the role of “orchestrator” in the Division’s product development process. Regarding packaging development, as far as the Luxe divison is considered, L’Oréal has opted for in-house control.  Thirty-five dedicated experts ensure the industrialisation, design, development, certification and specification of all of our finished products and packs.  Over 200 new moulds are created each year. All techniques are used, from glass to metal to a variety of plastics. To satisfy the highest aesthetic standards, various perfecting techniques are reviewed, from galvanisation to interior lacquering, for instance.  Close collaboration with suppliers selected from among the finest in the profession enables us to meet the most innovative technical challenges."
Carole Franck: time for renewal,"For the President of Carole Franck, “the products of the brand were praised for their very good quality, but were sometimes seen as a bit old-fashioned and quite expensive.”  It must be said that the time had suspended its flight over the quiet place du Général Catroux in Paris in the 17th arrondissement, where is located Carole Franck’s Aromas Spa. Indeed, the brand had launched no new products since 2010: actually an eternity in the cosmetics industry where continuous innovation has become a prerequisite for survival! Geoffroy de Rosamel therefore initiated a development program that led to renew the packaging of several products and gave birth to Okana Radiance Complexion, an emulsion for enhancing skin brightness, which is based on marine actives and oyster nacres. Four other launches should follow this one during the year. For Geoffroy de Rosamel, a former executive of Laboratoires Pierre Fabre’s Strategic Marketing Division, the challenge is to add new features while maintaining the values of a brand founded in 1975. Today, its newly formed marketing team is working at “bringing value to the brand’s DNA by capitalising on its main singularities and adding a touch of modernity and a lot of emotions."" In the meantime, Geoffroy de Rosamel set up three main goals: to develop a marketing strategy focused on the uniqueness and effectiveness of Carole Franck products, to rejuvenate the brand image and to revitalise its business on French territory. The French market now accounts for 20% only of the brand’s sales, which offers its two lines, in 150 beauty salons and about 80 pharmacies and para-pharmacies respectively.  According to Geoffroy de Rosamel, the development of the business in France implies to strengthen the brand’s presence in beauty salons, where Carole Franck has its origins and its strongest legitimacy.  A goal that requires the development of new treatment protocols and partnerships with schools and beauticians.  ""There are many beauticians who wish to create their own institute.  At the same time, four out of ten institutes created every year are going bankrupt after one year.  We need to find a way to support them.” With regard to exports (80% of sales), the priority is the diversification of markets. Indeed, while the brand is present in 60 countries (in Europe, North America, Asia and the Middle East), Asia represents 2/3 of the export turnover, with China being the first customer. The new management wants to better exploit other markets, with the United States and Japan being the main targets. In the mind of Carole Franck’s president, Aromas Spa at Place du General Catroux will symbolise the brand’s revival. Its front door now appears on the new packaging of all its new the emblem of Carole Franck new products.  The Spa, which is a beauty salon, a boutique, and an innovative centre for the development of new protocols, is also becoming a training centre for the brand’s partners in France and abroad. A scented candle named Une balade au Parc Monceau has even been created to pay tribute to this place and celebrate the brand’s new creativity."
Ponzini: a specialist in mascara brushes!,"An original story of this company based in Milan area that began one day in 1862 with the manufacture of carriages and “equipments” for horses. And in those “equipments” were obviously some brushes. This activity will finally be chosen and developed by the descendants of the company founder in the middle of the 20th century. Hair brushes, tooth brushes, the first small brushes on the market to apply mascaras... The story gathers momentum in the 1950s. Not that simple, a mascara brush! And even more complicated to manufacture at high speeds. A true know-how that will manage to cleverly develop leaders at Ponzini by designing their own assembly and cutting machines. A result, a speciality that draws the attention of industry players who foresee the fantastic boom of this make-up accessory, today the indispensable tool to feminine beauty. L’Oréal is one of them. “And who is still widely today,” says Lorenzo Bistoletti, Special Project Manager. To note that in 1997 managers at Ponzini decided to separate the two activities for the manufacturing of mascara brushes and tooth brushes. The first activity settles in Misinto in a 6,600m² building, the second stays in Lazzate. “Very quickly there was high demand from this growing market,” says Bistoletti. A market demand which has never stopped gaining in sophistication over the years. “We are now asked very high tech developments with hybrid mascaras and with more and more original shapes, often combining very different fibres from one another or combining fibres and injected plastic parts.”  In 2007, the Italian firm decided to invest in a production plant in China. “We thought for some time that injected brushes were going to conquer a significant market share, says Bistoletti, but eventually the traditional fibre brush remained the mainstay of mascaras, even if the development and production of injected mascara brushes will continue thanks to innovation.” The success of traditional brushes certainly owes a lot to the skill of mechanical specialists at Ponzini who, with the help of their “home-made” machines succeed in assembling, using a automatic process, fibres, textures and shapes of different sizes at impressive rates. A true work of art. “And believe me, say Lorenzo Bistoletti, there is still a lot to develop and discover.” Given the market growth, leaders plan to invest in two new lines this year. "
"FSKorea: one credo, innovation","Premium Beauty News - The latest brochure you just edited on the innovations designed by your company during the past few months is impressive. Not less than 13 innovations! JKH Wang - FSKorea is a company that builds prosperity via innovation and creativity. We have an innovative design team specialized in the provision of concept development, 3D modelling, visualization and digital data. We are constantly developing new ways of meeting and exceeding customer’s design requirements. Also our team provides turnkey design packages, while maintaining accurate budgets and timely projects. Our design team makes it a priority to stay in tune with industry trends to bring the best and newest ideas. Premium Beauty News - Could you comment and give us some details on some of those innovations? JKH Wang - Yes, with pleasure! Of course we cannot detail all thirteen of them here but we can mention the new patent-pending auto-fill droppers which functions easily and efficiently to ensure the consumer always has the correct dosage in the pipette every single time it is used. All the consumer has to do is twist the dropper top mounted on the container – the pipette automatically fills thanks to the new design, primed for use. To release, the user simply has to press the button on top of the dropper to release the liquid onto the desired spot. The system is extraordinarily clean, with almost no residue left inside of the applicator and easy to use – the button release mechanism requires minimal pressure to be activated. A word also on our “Spinning Powder Jar”. Once again refuses to disappoint the cosmetic market with its new spinning powder jar, a round powder container with a built in brush that spins to provide access to the applicator which can be popped out, used, then put back in place and spun shut for an extraordinarily handy product that’s as elegant as it is distinctive. The spin jar is incredibly easy to use, resting flat until the consumer picks it up and turns it open. The powder reservoir spins into the outer casing, exposing a lid that incorporates a brush. All the user has to do is pull out the lid, dip the brush into the reservoir, apply the product, then replace the lid and brush and spin the container closed. Premium Beauty News - You have also caused a small revolution in the world of powder jars... and the one of applicators for concealer and blush. JKH Wang - Rather than have to twist the “Grinding  Compact” to grind the top of the powder block and produce a fine powder, the consumer simply has to push down with a pad to have the entire top portion simultaneously lower and swivel, which releases a small dose that’s perfect for applying on the spot. It’s great for morning make-up application as well as spot treatments, and it can be carried around without fear of having a bag accidentally filled with powder. The new container includes a reservoir for pressed powder, which can be incredibly dense as it is shaved off upon use. The new grinder features a simple push-top mechanism. As regards our range of “All in One” applicators the first version, with just a quick twist, provides a brightening effect under eyes and along the cheek bones for an instant highlighting result and glow. No need to pack a separate brush : Its built-in tapered brush allows for precise application and it controls the amount of pressure against the skin. This super-soft applicator has a larger cut end compared to others and it expertly blends the product on the eyes. It is a real professional touch! Just slip it into your bag to ensure a luminous glow, from day to night. The second version: The new applicator presents a very handy and easy to use instrument for consumers, as it is small enough to carry in a bag all day. The container is perfect for concealers or a highlighting cream. Further, the high quality of the brush allows the consumer to use it at any moment by just twisting the bottom of the container, pushing the product up and out through the aperture, applying the correct amount, then using the brush to spread the product perfectly. The new version features a washable brush that ensures the packaging is always clean, as the dial dispenser ensures that only the required amount is dispensed at any single time. There is no worry of product spillage Rather than have the product dispensed directly into the applicator, this new version puts the aperture on the other side for a two-step, controlled application. Premium Beauty News - For brushes too, you never cease to innovate. JKH Wang - Intensive coverage brush collection is our new innovation, Intensive coverage brush head is very densely packed with bristle that feels extremely soft. A traditional paddle-shaped foundation brush, it takes more patience to build up coverage but FSKorea’s new innovative brush allows user to quickly pick up and distribute more product more rapidly. It is wonderful to work with and to blends foundation well and the silky brush hairs are a tactile pleasure! Also it is easy to control and user can pick up as much product as they want with it and vary the coverage, whether they are going for a more opaque finish or sheer look A various design of brush head cutting allows comfortable feeling on the skin and nicely for into facial grooves and corners for a smooth finish. Any shape that customer request, we can achieve them and gives a perfect tool for their foundation. With a slanted even cut, the supple velvety bristles feel comfortable on the skin and fit nicely into facial grooves and corners, allowing for a smooth finish. Also there are various shapes of brush head so customer can choose ideal design for their foundation. Intensive coverage brush is very densely packed with bristle which is remarkably soft. No scratches. It grabs foundation well, then it lay it down quickly and softly onto the face. Also it does not have a brush mark. Premium Beauty News - It is also one of your flagship innovations this year, the mascara...
 JKH Wang - We found a very common problem when applying mascara: the bristles on the market were tested and simply weren’t strong enough to apply dense formulations properly. The solution we have developed is to apply a heat treatment to the brush. This “baking” allows the formation of various shapes to the bristles, also making them stronger and harder. The special heat treatment makes bristles very tight and firm, provides great separation, and maximizes length and definition, providing the consumer with the ability to cover lashes thoroughly from root to tip. Thanks to this, more formula stays in place between the bristles providing a noticeable improvement in performance. Any design for shape of brush is available to appeal to every customer. We have also developed the spinning mascara which smoothly rolls on to your lashes causing no irritations to sensitive eyes. The spinning mascara may look just like the other mascaras. However, once you open the lid and pull the brush out you will see FS Korea’s secret weapon, the bar. This bar allows you to dip the brush into the formula container just once by capturing enough amount of formula, saving your time and energy of dipping it back and forth. With its spinning function and enough formula already on the brush, FS Korea’s spinning mascara guarantees better colour formation at every touch."
The Body Shop sets three goals to its suppliers! ,"Premium Beauty News - About the Supplier’s Day, it was the third edition. What were your goals? The Body Shop - We brought together 55 collaborative and strategic suppliers from all categories (Trade and Indirect Sourcing), from three areas (Emea, Apac and Ame). We wanted to confirm their commitment to reinforce their cooperation with The Body Shop through three objectives: – Inspire through the universe of the Brand, its 5 Core Values (Against animal testing; Supporting Community fair trade; Encouraging self-esteem, Defending human rights and Protecting our planet), its DNA and better integrate them into the company through our Award Ceremony, a question and answer session with The Body Shop and an opinion survey to measure the alignment of the strategy to the operational activity to identify the strong points and the ones requiring improvements. – Look back at the strategy and performance of The Body Shop and outline goals for the coming year. – Set up foundations for a sound development of the supplier relationship by also relying on good market practices thanks to the intervention of renown speakers in their fields: Gordon Crichton (Director of the MAI Institute of Purchasing Management - BEM Bordeaux Business School) and the Purchasing Director of the Lego Group, Michael McNulty. Premium Beauty News - You also presented the Innovation Day. What was it about? The Body Shop - This was the second edition of the Innovation Day, a major event. The objective being to identify innovations of tomorrow, the upcoming launches. They are proposals, meeting the briefs of the Brand or directly developed by the labs of our suppliers (following a market evolution or based on their knowledge of The Body Shop ranges). Through the Innovation Day we want to improve synergies with our suppliers to be more market responsive and launch products faster, when demand emerges. We received for example more than 60 drafts from suppliers we had invited like, Chromavis, Laleham, S&J, LF Beauty, Autumn Harp and Fareva. We hope to convert 10% of these innovations and thus irrigate the pipeline of product launches for 2014. Premium Beauty News - Your brand strategy was redefined, and you are rolling out a new store concept, what are the results? What is the role of suppliers? The Body Shop - Indeed our ""natural and ethical"" brand strategy has been redefined and clarified. The Body Shop offer is increasingly focused on ingredients while highlighting our 5 core values. We talk about “story selling” (connect our Values to the product in the purchasing process). In parallel, the goal is to optimize our formats with fewer but more efficient launches, relying on the core products of the brand. We have also launched a new store design called “Pulse”, which will be identical in all countries. This design is currently being deployed in 400 outlets. This new design is a major change that contributes to the acceleration of our growth. Our vision of beauty is “Beauty with Heart” which can be translated as follows:
– ’Look Good’ through product efficiency,
– ’Feel Good’ thanks to the texture and fragrances in our formulas,
– ’Do Good’ with the five founding values of the Brand. Our suppliers have a major role to play either in the relaunch of the Brand, or in the deployment of our new store strategy. They are integrated at a very early stage in these projects. Their contribution is tangible on every pillar of their performance: quality, level of service, sustainable development, innovation and launches and competitiveness. A sign of their importance for The Beauty Shop, our CEO, Fréderic Ennabli was present at the event, as well as three members of the Executive Committee: Ann Massal - Exec for the Brand, Philippe Reale - Exec for Operations and Paul Mc Greevy - Exec for R&I values. We are also strengthening our links with L’Oréal by creating the right gateways (that provide results for The Body Shop). Régine Lucas, the new Group Purchasing Director and Isabelle Faivre, Subcontracting and Partnership Purchasing Director, also attended the event. In conclusion: The Body Shop is enjoying an honourable growth of + 4.9% in 2012, despite a difficult economic environment, and its turnover was of 855.3 million euros, according to figures published by the L’Oréal group.  The Brand still has a bright future ahead with the ongoing development of its Internet sales and its store redeployment."
Alkos Group: the strength of the French know-how!,"We are French and proud of it!  “It is not by chance, explains Florence Lefeuvre, the Sales and Marketing Director, if we wanted to assert our feeling of belonging to the long-standing French know-how in the manufacture of cosmetics with our little Eiffel Tower at the centre of our communication.” Especially since the expertise of the Alkos Group is real. “It just needed to be nurtured,” says Dominique Vautier, CEO. “A process which started two years ago and which is not competed yet...” First axis, reinforce the image of a group of its own that concentrates the expertise of Alkos, the only manufacturer of Made In France cosmetic pencils praised by export markets, of Intercosmétiques specialized in the development and industrialization of cosmetic and skincare products and finally of Sagal, a manufacturer of soaps and perfumed deo sticks.  Second axis, highlight the capacity for innovation and the wealth of the offer of these three entities: – Make-up: in all possible galenic forms: pencils, fluid, poured, sticks and for every axes, eyes, lips, face and even nails.
– Skincare: in airless tubes, bottles, jars, sticks for creams, masks, serums, scrubs, bi-phase, milks, gels, jellies, mists, oils.
– Scented soaps and deos: with translucent and transparent, opaque textures. ""Our strength also stands in our full range of services to meet the needs of our customers and the market trends, explains Vautier. Our core-business is to provide industrialized innovations (concepts and products) and ‘tailor-made’ products to our customers using their briefs as a starting point. Our activity is complemented by a comprehensive’ full-service offer (developed by our teams from formulation and components to the finished products), including a ‘partial’ full-service offer (with components developed by our clients’ services).” Third axis, guarantee a top level of quality services (99.3%, 99.5% and 99.9%) and OTIF which makes the Group’s strength for the three entities. The French group is also very proud of the motivation and involvement of the staff in the three Business Units which is capable, since 2012 of working on a 3X8 7d/7d basis if necessary. To fulfil these commitments, the Group did not skimp on resources both human and technical. The Intercosmétiques plant located in Angers is capable of producing some 41 million units per year (currently 25 million in skincare and 16 million in make-up). The workshops operate under a controlled-atmosphere and the factory provides custom developments matching the specificities of each project whether in formulation, manufacturing or packaging. As regards make-up more specifically, the factory offers for 2013 a capacity of 20 million pieces for lipsticks, 13 millions for gloss, 10 million for mascaras and 6 million for hot filled products. Citus, a “latest-generation” brand new machine for hot filled lipsticks was commissioned a few days ago. The factory is also capable of filling 30 million tubes, 14 million bottles, 3.5 million of jars and 8 million of airless bottles. As for the Sagal plant, the production capacity for soaps in 2013 will exceed 15 million units and that of deo sticks 6 million units. Finally the Alkos Cosmétiques factory located in the North of France will rely this year on an overall production capacity of 96 million pieces. 34% of its turnover comes from wood-made cosmetic pencils (Slim, Jumbo and Super Jumbo) and 46% from plastic pencils (Slim and Jumbo) which, due to the sharp increase in demand explains the installation of a new high performance line for the filling of plastic pencils. The factory’s other booming activity concerns the production of eyeliner pens, brushpens, French liners, make-up felt erasers and correctors, for an overall conditioning capacity of 30 million pieces per year accounting for 18% of sales. The Group is now reaping the fruits of a successful “product” repositioning and of industrial investments with sales jumping from nearly EUR 27 million in 2009 to more than 41 million expected this year. “Our make-up product offer, which represents 55% of our business, has enriched itself considerably,” emphasises Lefeuvre. “We will be showcasing a whole range of new products on the occasion of upcoming professional events, at Cosmoprof Bologna this week and MakeUp in Paris in a few months.” Alkos has decided to give readers of Premium Beauty News a sneak preview of some of the fruits of its innovative harvest by unveiling its Jumbo Twist Mania. A series of innovative textures presented as part of a Full Service offer with a new gesture, Must Have: at last a lipstick mechanism in the form of a pencil! It comes in two generations of packaging, the latter is sleek with a cap following the body alignment. Many textures will be presented: the lipstick Couture, intense and rich; the natural and light Color Balm, the Glossy Touch, a comfortable gloss with a finish bursting with natural brightness. The Jumbo Twist also comes in a very interesting formula in between skincare and make-up, the Beauty Care Balm. Easy to use correcting concealer will also be showcased. Ultra Long Lasting Eyeshadows are also in preparation for MakeUp in Paris.... Skincare Innovation will present three new serums: the WakeUp Serum with an ultra-light texture, enriched with anti-aging tightening actives; the Renewal Night Serum boosted with a unique mixture with ultra restorative properties; the Sugar of Life Serum, a fresh jelly stimulating the cell renewal. Alkos also complements its range of ultra long-lasting plastic pencils with the introduction of the Waterproof Addict Eyebrow Pencil and the Universal Lip care liner; Anti Age Defying Lip Liner.
The Alkos team is exited to introduce these new products and more!... at the Cosmoprof (Hall 15 - Stand C6-D5)."
"“The life cycle of an organic cosmetic is very short,” Nicolas Fouchère, Laboratoire Sicobel","Premium Beauty News - The Laboratoire Sicobel is known for its natural dermo-cosmetic brands. You were one of the pioneers in this segment? Nicolas Fouchère -  That’s right. The Laboratoire Sicobel, which now has more than 60 years of existence, has made a name for itself thanks to its natural actives promoting skin cell regeneration. Placentor, the historic brand of the laboratory was one of the pioneers in “phytodermatology” When I took over the company in 1996, I chose to reinforce this positioning, combining natural actives and dermo-cosmetic products. We worked all our formulas to make them more natural while ensuring that they remained effective. Premium Beauty News - This is the time when you embarked on the bio adventure? Nicolas Fouchère - We realized that we had trouble developing the reformulation work we had undertaken with Placentor. In France, the emerging organic trend seemed to be a strong element of differentiation. And the Laboratoire Sicobel became a founding member of the Cosmébio Association. The organic approach allowed for the implementation of precise specifications, controlled by certification bodies independent from manufacturers and brands. In 2003, we launched the BcomBio brand with an in-house team, because at the time outside expertise in this area was scarce. And we stayed in our field: Dermo-cosmetics. BcomBio was the first biological brand to enter pharmacies. At first, we had to face some scepticism from our interlocutors. But the bio trend helped us and big pharmacies, eager to respond to the competition from health & beauty stores began to really take an interest in our products and support them. Today, the Laboratoire Sicobel manages five brands. Two brands with a strong natural connotation but not bio certified: Placentor – our historic brand, and Edenens, which targets young women. And three organic brands: BcomBio, BcomBio Homme, BBcomBio our organic dermo cosmetic brand for babies. Premium Beauty News - Going organic is therefore compatible with a dermo-cosmetic positioning for which the need for efficiency is particularly high? Nicolas Fouchère - We clearly epitomize this. Dermo-cosmetics is an integral part of Sicobel’s DNA. In our case, they are self-prescribed dermo-cosmetics. From the beginning we were careful to make sure that our products were efficient and we had them tested. This was not always easy because at the very beginning the number of ingredients available was very limited. The efficiency goal we had set ourselves with forced us to enter into a continuous reformulation process to take advantage of new ingredients that kept appearing on the market. I can say that for the past 3 or 4 years we have managed to get with our organic products the same results as with conventional dermo-cosmetic products. Premium Beauty News - While remaining competitive in terms of prices? Nicolas Fouchère - There is no significant price difference between BcomBio and conventional dermo-cosmetic brands. Again this was one of our goals and it called for much efforts. Indeed, organic formulas are generally more expensive, to which must be added the certification cost. In addition, the life cycle of a bio product is often very short. As new molecules are made available to us at a very fast pace, we reformulate very often in order to remain at the forefront of innovation. This ongoing reformulation process, very characteristic of the bio in its early stages, is still very true today. In a nutshell, we must make efforts on our margins. Premium Beauty News - Hence the organic positioning is particularly delicate. What is your insight on the true potential of this market? Nicolas Fouchère -  Since 2011 the growth in sales of organic cosmetics has slowed down. We went from a double-digit very strong growth, to a much more moderate growth. In such a context, there must therefore be a feeling of disappointment from some major groups who had made significant efforts to develop themselves on the market. Currently, it is estimated that the organic market accounts for between 3.5 and 4% of the French market. There has been a mushrooming of brands until the 2010s but a slowdown in sales as of 2011 led distributors to streamline their offer and there was a lot of product delisting. In our case, we always thought claiming being bio was not enough to convince consumers. This is even truer on the dermo-cosmetic market where we work in the long term, and where credibility is required on every front. Like all the other players, we suffered from the slowdown on the market of organic cosmetics in 2011. But we resisted quite well afterwards particularly thanks to the development of cardboard boxes for our products. Initially, we had decided not to use secondary packaging, but their introduction early 2012 allowed us to better express the uniqueness of our brand. Premium Beauty News - And how do you see the future? Nicolas Fouchère - We will first continue our efforts, to renew our ranges, in reformulation and in the research of new actives, with the aim to continue to offer products at the best level. Then our second axis of development is the internationalization of our brands. Currently Placentor (10% of our export turnover) is the only one of our brands to be truly present outside France, even though BcomBio was launched in Italy, Belgium and Russia. In parallel, we continue our contract manufacturing business which represents 10% of our turnover and which enables us to constantly confront ourselves to new issues. Premium Beauty News - What is the impact of regulatory changes underway, particularly the forthcoming entry into force of the new European Regulation on cosmetics? Nicolas Fouchère - This is especially heavy for SMEs that must be at the same level as large groups, yet without having the same means. This represents of course an additional cost to our profitability."
"Intercos, 40 years and on top form!","Does it mean the Intercos “model” has changed? The driving forces which still constitute and will continue to constitute what many do not hesitate to call the “Intercos exception” are well and truly there! “Creativity pushed to its limits, continuous innovation, unbridled research, marketing and anticipation of market trends,” a unique winning combination that no company in the sector has so far, admittedly, managed to come to par with. Not to forget one of the Italian Group’s major asset, an industrial production capacity available in every corner of the world. “Supporting or even anticipating our customers’ needs,” insists Ferrari, “the experience shows that we were right to settle in the United States, where we now have three factories, and in Asia, where we have four factories. We will be opening a plant this year in Brazil near Sao Paulo and we are about to sign a joint venture in Japan for our colour activity”. After the downturn imposed by the 2008 crisis, business at Intercos resumed with renewed vigour. The group’s strategic plan for the coming months is running like clockwork. While maintaining and developing the core values that have made its success, Intercos intends to successfully complete its restructuring, that is to say by building on its ability to focus on creation, but also by making it more accessible to a larger number of companies. Continue to innovate but by always keeping in mind reactivity and competitiveness.  “Time to market..., time to market!” insists Ferrari. But innovation means “research”! And in this domain, the Italian group has never lowered its guard, quite the contrary. 460 people out of a total staff of 3,200 work on innovation. That is, nearly 15% of the Intercos staff. An estimated cost of 145 million euros in 5 years! Who can top that! As a result, more than 10,000 new formulas emerge each year from the six research laboratories of the company located for four of them, in Europe, one in Asia and the last one in the United States. “And each of these research centres has a dedicated mission,” says Ferrari.  “Hence, the one in Maastricht in the Netherlands looks like a real start-up that takes full advantage of the fantastic research environment in this region. It is mainly specialized in the development of innovative raw materials for colour and skin-care. In China, the laboratory is in charge of finding new competitive raw materials etc.” Research, creativity, marketing, a comprehensive range that takes full advantage of the industrial clout that the group has built around the globe in ten year’s time. Results are quite impressive here too: twelve factories, a production capacity of more than 1.5 billion pieces per year! A turnover divided between the USA (52%), Europe (39%) and Asia (9%)! ""And we have more in reserve,"" explain officials at the Group’s headquarters in Agrate Brianza, near Milan. “Opportunities for growth are strong across the Atlantic and huge in Asia, emphasises Ferrari, and we progress by 30% every year!” To note that one of the two U.S. plants has seen its surface increase this year by 10,000 sqm. Not to mention Brazil, where a 10,000 sqm factory will be commissioned in the coming days, without forgetting Japan. “As for Italy, he says, we have one of the most remarkable factory in the world in Dovera with its 40,000 sqm of surface production to which we are about to add an additional 15,000 sqm.” The Agrate site will focus in the end on emulsions to gradually become a technological centre dedicated to powders and lipsticks. “Options are also clear for our markets, says Ferrari. Colour remains the bulk of our business (55%) followed by pencils (22%), skincare (12%) and the rest. It is on the prestige market that we achieve the largest part of our business (34%) followed by mass market (25%), direct sales and private labelling sharing the rest. We have invested heavily in our industrial and our research capacity in skin care and pencils (a current capacity of 100 million pieces per year!) to manage to become key players in these two segments. As for the full service activity, there is no denying that it is continuing to grow.” “I will have the good fortune of turning seventy this year, says ironically Ferrari, but at the same time it is sort of a handicap of being already seventy!”  A septuagenarian who has clearly not lost his appetite to undertake."
Taiki increases European capabilities and launches antimicrobial resin,"Taiki wants to offer an even wider range of full service solutions to its customers, the big players in the European cosmetics industry in Europe.  The supplier of makeup and skincare tools, dispensers and products, is therefore working at strengthening its production capabilities in Europe.  Taiki Cosmetics Europe thus announced alsmost simultaneously the conclusion of two strategic partnerships. The first agreement, with Monomer Tech, a company based in Barcelona, specialized in plastic injection and customized packaging developments for the cosmetics industry, focuses on plastic injection of closures and containers and the production of high quality powder puffs. The second agreement, with Famar, a top name in the European pharmaceutical industry, will initially give Taiki increased filling/packaging capacity for its functionnal dispensers and masks. “This partnership will allow Taiki to further develop its ‘full service’ offer to its growing customer base,” said the company in a release. Simultaneously, Taiki also announces the introduction on the European market of EcoG+, a patented antimicrobial plastic resin. EcoG+ allows creating packaging and functional dispensers that play an active role in the preservation of the formula.  This new resin combines three materials: plastic, glass beads and Silver ions AG+.  “This preservative matrix will allow Taiki’s customers to reduce or suppress preservative agents in their formulas,” claims the company. Established in 2008, Taiki Cosmetics Europe is the subsidiary of Japanese group Taiki, and achieved a turnover of 10,5 million euros in 2012, 14 employees in Paris, France."
Mascara brushes: Dupont is pulling out all the stops and going upscale!,"Premium Beauty News - A market always on the rise! With it seems a strong comeback of fibre-based brushes. Sarah Perreard - Yes, we can consider that this market is continuing to grow globally by about 6% a year, with differences depending on countries of course. It is clear that those with the highest increase can be mostly found in Asia, South America and Central Europe. As for the different types of brushes, the latest statistics show that indeed fibre brushes are becoming again increasingly popular among women and therefore brands. We can consider that they represent about 60% of the market, with the remaining 40% still belonging to the injected brushes. Premium Beauty News - An old story that of mascaras. Sarah Perreard - A story that dates back to the 19th century with the arrival of the first non-toxic mascara imagined by the chemist Eugène Rimmel who used a bulk made of petroleum jelly. In 1913 another chemist, T.L. Williams creates a similar substance for his sister Maybel. In 1917, the first mascara sees the light with the company Maybelline. In 1923 appears the cake mascara, sold for the first time with a brush as applicator. In 1957 Helena Rubinstein creates a lotion-based cream formula. Mascara-Matic, the first mascara wand and tube applicator is launched. It is the “first automatic mascara that needs no brush”. 1959 is the year of the launch of the Maybelline Magic Mascara, the first filaments twisted brush (spiral brush). In 1964, the Ultra Lash mascara by Maybelline is created, the first mass market tubed mascara. Then we can make a huge leap in time, with in 2004, the launch by Beiersdorf of “Lash Revolution” with its brand Nivea Beauty, it is the first moulded brush using thermoplastic elastomer. Premium Beauty News - In fact what is important in the design of a mascara to make it efficient? Sarah Perreard - Having a good fit between the brush and the bulk is the most important factor. The winning association between formula-wiper-brush ensures the efficiency of a mascara. In no way only one of the parameter alone would make a difference. For this reason, it is crucial to develop the brush depending on the bulk or vice and versa. We can summarize by saying that the main parameters on which we can play are: the tightness of the wiper, the thickness of the formula, the filament, the brush design, and the brush stiffness. Premium Beauty News - Why is the stiffness of a mascara brush so important in the make-up result? Sarah Perreard - When the brush is not stiff enough compared to the thickness of the bulk, the “umbrella effect”, feared by consumers, happens: when the filaments go through the wiper in order to clean the excess of mascara, if the bulk is too thick, filaments have difficulty to get back in shape, they remain stuck together. This is also what happens when the formula has dried. The brush stiffness is influenced by the following factors: the number of filaments in the brush, the filament diameter, shape and length, as well as their composition (the resin they are made of). Most of our filaments are made of nylon 612 and some of thermoplastic elastomer, which both offer minimum liquid absorption which respects the formula, not making it dry. Premium Beauty News - The range of fibres that you offer is very wide? Sarah Perreard - That’s right! The most standard and the first one we offered in the 1960’s is DuPont™ Tynex® Standard (0900) which characteristics you find in all other filaments we have developed since then: solid round level filament and cylindrical shape.  It is a Nylon 12.6 in diameters ranging from 0.051 mm to 0.127 mm (2mil - 5mil). A product suited for nails, mascaras but also other applications.  Main advantages: excellent bend recover (thus, optimum application), low liquid absorption (respects the bulk), good stiffness when wet. But I can also detail you our range DuPont™ Tynex® Soft (0902) whose main advantages can be summarized as:
– Soft feel
– Full brush
– Half the stiffness of standard Tynex®
– Smooth lay down and flexible application
– Excellent bend recovery. Our range DuPont™ Tynex® Supersoft (3100) which is a thermoplastic elastomer with the following main advantages: soft touch and low stiffness even with large diameter.
In terms of make-up “benefits” this means:  smooth laydown and flexible control, and a soft brush, nice to use. Premium Beauty News - Filaments are not all cylindrical, quite the contrary! Sarah Perreard - Indeed, the shape of the fibre is often fundamental to obtain a specific desired effect. Thus in the case of our DuPont™ Tynex® Hollow (0950 & 0951), several ranges are available:
– 0950: oval hollow filament.
– 0951: round hollow filament.
– Cylindrical shape. Main added value: 
– Lower stiffness than solid round filaments.
– Used for soft bushy brushes.
– Hollow section enhances design freedom.
Results in terms of make-up: 
– Soft and unique make-up experience thanks to the softness of the hollow filament.
– Bushy brush allows to carry thick bulk for great volume result. Another interesting example with our DuPont™ Tynex® Seahorse (0960) which is a round level hollow filament.
Main advantages:
– Great Amount of surfaced area.
– Random shape formation.
– Hollow section allow for design freedom. Regarding make-up result: exceptional pick up and pay off. Premium Beauty News - Then sophistication rises crescendo! Sarah Perreard - This is indeed the case with our DuPont™ Tynex® Diamond Hollow (0993) with a diamond shape hollow filament. Main advantages: 
– Diamond shape increases filament surface area in contact with the lashes.
– Sparkly appearance.
– The hollow section ensures a soft touch. Make-up result: more volume is brought to the lashes thanks to a unique diamond shape. Its angled shape penetrates easily between the lashes for a better separation. Our DuPont™ Tynex® Quadrilobal (0920) is a four-lobed level filament. Main advantage:  Up to 10% more surface area with 20% less volume, as compared to equivalent diameter of solid round filament.  Regarding make-up result, this means exceptional pick up and pay off. The DuPont™ Tynex® Crimp (0900HW) is a solid round wavy filament which brings bushiness to the brush which therefore holds more formula into the crimps allowing for volume result. In the case of DuPont™ Tynex® splittable (0930) and DuPont™ Tynex® Supersoft splittable (3100), it is a three hole hollow filament, the first one being in nylon, the second one in thermoplastic elastomer, softer.
Main key advantages:
– Large diameter, splittable into thin tips.
– Once separated, the filament offer surface with more filaments which improves the brush performance.
Make-up result: Lengthens the lashes thanks to the splittable tips of the filament that retain the formula up to the tip. Premium Beauty News - You end up adding a lot of features on your filament. Sarah Perreard - That’s true! This is also the case with our DuPont™ Tynex® Texturized (0901) which is a textured solid round level filament.  Main advantage: structured surface.
Make-up result:
– Higher pick up and release of formula.
– Enhanced pick-up prolonged hold of the formula up to the tip of the lashes, resulting in perfect and uniformly covered lashes from origin to the end. As for our DuPont™ Tynex® Natrafil ® (0101), it is a polyester with different additives. Main added value:
– Structured surface.
– Softer than nylon-based Tynex® Textured.
Make-up result:
– Higher pick up and release of formula.
– Soft feel even in small brush. Finally, the last but not the least. The DuPont™ Tynex ® PTFE loaded (0906).
It is a solid round level filament loaded with PTFE.  Main advantages: Improved slip characteristics allow for better bulk distribution on the filaments; it allows to use longer filaments while ensuring that the bulk is distributed on the whole length of the filament. It also allows to increase the speed of application. Make-up result: 
– Less residuals on the lashes thanks to better redistribution of the bulk along the filaments after wringage in the neck.
– Maximum distribution of the bulk on the lashes, since attachment on the brush is limited. Volume is brought thanks to thicker layers of bulk. Premium Beauty News - We do not always realize but could you give us a few figures to give us an idea of the number of fibres in a mascara brush? Sarah Perreard - It varies from one brush to another, as the number of filaments per brush is one of the crucial parameters in terms of make-up result. What I can tell you is that one kilo of fibre enables to make on average 10,000 mascara and 40,000 nail polish brushes. Premium Beauty News - So what really makes the success of a mascara?  Sarah Perreard - Like for any product what ensures the second buy of a mascara is its capacity to deliver the promised result. But we may add that each consumer has different lashes, and specially a different gesture when applying mascara, which has a huge impact on the make-up result. This being said, in terms of product development, we will never repeat enough the importance of developing a brush according to the bulk or vice and versa, since the success hangs on the association between brush – bulk – wiper."
"After 2012 sales grow, L’Oreal expects to outperform market in 2013","Jean-Paul Agon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of L’Oréal, was right to be confident during the presentation of the group’s 2012 first half results.  While the global cosmetics market grew by 4.6% in 2012, L’Oréal’s sales amounted to 22.463 billion euros, an increase of +10.4% at December 31st, 2012.  Like-for-like, i.e. based on a comparable structure and identical exchange rates, the sales trend of the L’Oréal Group was +5.5%.  The Group benefited of a favourable currency effect, thanks to the (relative) weakness of the euro at the beginning of 2012. Globally, currency fluctuations had a positive impact of +4.2%.  Eventually, the group’s net profit grew by +17.6%. Reflecting the evolutions of the global cosmetics market, L’Oréal results are quite contrasted from a geographic area to the other. In Western Europe, the economic context saw the decline of markets in the southern countries, particularly in hair salons and the luxury segment, and the resilience of the rest of Europe. At 12 months, L’Oréal sales increased by +0.6% like-for-like, and +2.1% based on reported figures, thus raising its market share. The group performed well, particularly in France - where the acquisition of Cadum fully played its part - in the United Kingdom, in Germany and in Northern Europe.  Despite this moderate growth, Western Europe remains the group’s most profitable region. In North America, L’Oréal ended 2012 with growth of 7.2% like-for-like and 18.3% based on reported figures. The good results seen in 2011 were surpassed in 2012, with a strong growth of Garnier, Maybelline and Essie, the very good results of Clarisonic and the increased presence in drugstores of products of the Active Cosmetics Division. 2012 also marked a milestone in the acceleration of L’Oréal’s  internationalisation, as the “New Markets” (Asia-Pacific, Eastern and Central Europe, Africa, and Middle-East) became the number one geographic zone, accounting for 40% of the group’s turnover. In the Asia-Pacific region, L’Oréal achieved annual growth of +9.6% like-for-like (+18.4% based on reported figures). India, Indonesia and Thailand are particularly dynamic.  India (+35% on average), for instance, is the main contributor to the growth of the Professional Products Division.  In the geographic area, according to Jean-Paul Agon, the improvement of the group’s results requires to strengthen the penetration of local retail channels. In China, in particular, L’Oréal is seeking to strengthen its positions in 3rd and 4th rank cities. In Latin America, L’Oréal faces more difficulties.  The group achieved like-for-like growth of +10.4% and +8.7% based on reported figures, and bets on its acquisitions to accelerate its growth. In Africa and in the Middle East, L’Oréal is growing by +14.7% like-for-like and +17.6% based on reported figures, with very good performances in Turkey, the Gulf States and the Levant. 2012 was notable for the rising momentum of new subsidiaries in Egypt and Kenya, and the opening of a new subsidiary in Saudi Arabia.

"Al Lustrino, Laura Mercier: ""An ongoing quest for innovation""","Premium Beauty News - A few words first on the Gurwitch Products Group and its two ’flagship’ brands, Laura Mercier and RéVive. Al Lustrino - Gurwitch Products is the parent company of two of the prestige beauty industry’s leading brands, Laura Mercier and RéVive. As of July 27, 2006, Gurwitch Products operates as a subsidiary of Alticor, Inc. The company maintains corporate offices in Manhattan, Houston and London, and its products are sold in more than 1,000 stores across 27 countries. Laura Mercier is a global luxury line of cosmetics, skincare, body & bath and fragrance. Founded in 1996, by French makeup artist, Laura Mercier, the brand is based upon the founder’s philosophy of “what makes you unique makes you beautiful.” She is known for the flawless face- the concept that making skin look perfect is the first and foremost important thing a woman can do to achieve a great look. Laura believes that a flawless look begins with a fresh canvas, and each product has been specially developed to allow every woman to achieve an incredibly even, smooth, natural-looking complexion. Laura Mercier is an international brand sold in 27 countries. Key US retailers include Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom, Bloomingdales and Sephora.

Today, RéVive products are available at Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, Barneys New York, Blue Mercury, Harrods, Liberty, and Space NK. Premium Beauty News - Laura Mercier, it’s first an atypical career! Al Lustrino - Laura Mercier is a world-renowned makeup artist and founder of Laura Mercier Cosmetics. As the personal makeup artist to celebrities such as Sarah Jessica Parker, Julia Roberts, and Juliette Binoche, and as a contributor to cover designs and editorial shoots, Laura Mercier created looks that are both flawless and accentuate one’s natural beauty. Raised in Provence, Laura began her training at age 17 when she entered a painting school in Paris. After deciding to shift her talents from the canvas to the face, Laura attended the Carita School where she studied in makeup application. Subsequently she represented Carita as a makeup artist and makeup teacher, working closely with Thibault Vabre. In 1985, Laura moved to New York when she was asked to join the team to launch American Elle. She immediately began working on advertising campaigns for Bergdorf Goodman, Bloomingdale’s, Clairol, as well as editorial spreads for magazines including Elle, Vanity Fair, Glamour and several other publications. She began working with clients such as L’Oreal, Maybelline, Victoria’s Secret, Gap, Banana Republic, and many other cosmetic and clothing companies, while working with Madonna on her looks for print, television and film. Subsequently Laura entered into a four-year contract with Elizabeth Arden, designing the makeup looks for all of their advertising campaigns, and also worked with Chanel on the company’s beauty advertising campaigns in France. In 1996, Laura developed Laura Mercier Cosmetics to benefit women of all ages and skin types. She personally created the colours to satisfy the needs of her clients, based on a classic and always-current palette, rather than seasonal trends only. 
The Laura Mercier line has received numerous accolades from customers and magazine editors. Premium Beauty News - Basically, it is a particular approach? Al Lustrino - Based in Laura’s belief that “what makes you unique makes you beautiful,” the brand empowers each woman to express and embrace her own individual beauty.  Through the creative, artisan vision of a professional makeup artist, the innovative makeup, skincare, body and fragrance products combined with application techniques, are designed to enhance every woman’s Flawless Face and inspire confidence. As a working professional makeup artist, Laura saw the need for several products, particularly in face makeup, that were missing from the traditional cosmetics marketplace. Unable to find the formulas, colours, and textures she wanted, she began experimenting and mixing her own to fill the “white space” in makeup in creating the flawless complexion. Her search to find the products that worked for her professionally expanded to the desire to help every woman achieve her full beauty potential, and in 1996, the Laura Mercier line was born. The brand’s iconic products – the primer, tinted moisturizer, and secret camouflage, and setting powder – help women achieve their own flawless face in four simple steps. Step 1: Prime the Skin
Laura’s invention, Foundation Primer, creates the perfect canvas for makeup application. Step 2: Apply Foundation
Laura believes makeup should look as natural as possible which is why she created a luxurious collection of Foundations and Tinted Moisturizers in a rich range of shades and finishes. Step 3: Conceal
Laura never goes anywhere without concealer—her award winning Secret Camouflage completely covers imperfections. Step 4: Set with Powder
For a look that lasts all day Laura recommends setting makeup with Loose Setting Powder. Premium Beauty News - A celebrity  Make-Up Artist has recently joined your company? Al Lustrino -   Celebrity makeup artist, Matin Maulawizada, is the Global Artistry Director for Laura Mercier. In this role, Matin works closely with Laura Mercier herself to develop all products, ensuring they all support the brand’s overarching flawless philosophy.  He also plays a key role in evaluating and providing feedback on products in development and recommending shade ranges and colour trends. Matin is very familiar with the Laura Mercier products as he was the first National Makeup Artist when the brand was launched in the mid-1990s! Premium Beauty News - As head of packaging development, what is your main concern? Al Lustrino - Clearly, I’m in a constant quest for innovation. And I must admit that real innovation is very difficult to come by and identify. Premium Beauty News - The interaction between container and contents is increasing? Al Lustrino - We cannot focus solely on the packaging as far as cosmetics are concerned. The interaction between package and product is a critical consideration and needs to exceed the customer’s expectation"
"""Logistics can be a real competitive advantage for SMEs involved in cosmetics,"" Rémi Perrot","Premium Beauty News - You have developed an offer combining logistics, shipment and exports management, more specifically dedicated to SMEs operating in the cosmetic industry. The needs of this sector are really specific? Rémi Perrot - What is certain is that small and medium companies in this sector rely heavily on international markets. This is particularly true for French companies who often achieve 60-80% of their abroad. International shipments are regular, to varied destinations but often for small quantities. And these companies do not always find a solution matching their specific needs. What we are offering them is to completely relieve them from the burden of logistics issues by providing them in, addition to the management of their exports: a warehousing area to store their production in good conditions, a team familiar with order-picking and packing. Another plus, we understand their daily concerns. In addition to our know-how as a freight forwarder capable of assisting them the world over, our clients benefit from a personalized assistance and of this flexibility which is specific to human-sized groups, responsive and capable of offering a customised service. Premium Beauty News - In details, what does your offer consist in? Rémi Perrot - This is a complete offer that combines logistics, shipment and exports management. STIO has 10,000 m2 (107,000 sq ft) of warehousing space in Morangis, 20 km South of Paris and near the Orly airport and Rungis. We can also handle BtoB order-picking and our clients can access via our website to a software enabling them to know in real time their stock status. For shipment, again we focus on1 flexibility. We can organize the shipment with our carriers, but our clients are completely free to use their own providers. Finally, STIO’s strong point is the organization of exports, both by air and by sea. For this we rely on a network of reliable correspondents and we have weekly groupage departures from the Roissy CDG airport to Nagoya, Johannesburg, Jakarta and Houston, and a regular groupage line from Le Havre to Nagoya, Shanghai, New York and Cape Town. Our offer is aimed at companies whose business volume in exports is starting to gain importance, who need a reliable and qualified service provider capable of understanding their needs, of relieving them completely of logistical issues, without the rigidity of industry giants. We also have among our clients some start-ups like Fruit Too, the French brand specialised in skin care dedicated to children, or Carita-Decléor, for which we manage the flow to and from Japan. On imports, we also manage the flow of goods of the distributor of OPI the nail polish brand, in France. Premium Beauty News - Concerning these issues, isn’t cost the first decision factor of companies? Rémi Perrot - Yes and no. Cost is obviously important but reliability and trust are two points not to be neglected. Many SMEs focus, rightly, on the development and marketing of their products. Often, logistical issues appear as a distant concern and are eventually neglected and delegated to a carrier or managed on a piecemeal basis. Yet, they can represent a real competitive advantage for SMEs, especially in a highly internationalized sector like cosmetics. In this industry, the ability to respond within short deadlines, to meet the requirements of the clients’ schedule, are key elements for success. Other factors, such as concerns related to sustainable development are also important. In times when many cosmetic companies engage in exemplary approaches at this level, both their service providers and suppliers must also play their part in this dynamic. This is why we engaged ourselves in an environmental management process which enabled us to obtain the ISO 14001 certification. This approach is also part of the changes that are going to shake the profession this year. Indeed, an order now sets to 1 October 2013 the beginning of the obligation for all transport providers to indicate on the invoice of every customer, the level of CO2 emissions during the transport."
Rexam finalises sale of its personal care business,"The London-headquartered consumer packaging company confirmed today that it has received approval from the Chinese authorities for the sale of its cosmetics, toiletries and household care products business for 459 million US dollars in cash.

Last November, the European Commission also cleared the Albéa-Rexam merger considering that “customers in the cosmetics and perfumery industry will continue to have alternative suppliers for cosmetic packaging.” The completion of this last regulatory step, opens the way to the creation a global leader in laminate and plastic tubes, foam pumps, fragrance samplers, lipstick and mascara containers, formed by the adjunction of Rexam’s cosmetics (10 manufacturing units, 6,000 staff) business to Albéa (35 manufacturing, 10,000 staff).

Allergen substances and perfumes: Prodarom is forging ahead,"Premium Beauty News - Finally, what were the conclusions of this summit meeting? Philippe Massé - The perfume industry met in Grasse to take stock of the progress made by the European Commission on the issue of allergens in fragrance raw materials. Prodarom members and representatives of relevant organizations shared their views and questions with the IFRA (International Fragrance Association) to better understand the possible options that the Commission could take to implement an appropriate and proportionate management of the risk created by allergens while taking into account the specificities of citizens and of the industry. This exchange of views provided the desired clarifications and a perfect understanding on the development of the issue. Premium Beauty News - An old story that of Prodarom! You are its 27th President! Philippe Massé - Yes, since it dates back to 1724, with at that time, the creation of what was called ""Jurande des gantiers-parfumeurs"" (Wardenship of glovemakers & perfumers). It was not until December 22, 1898 that this designation changed to ""Trade union of the Perfumers-Distillers of the Alpes-Maritimes region"" Nearly fifty years after, in January 17, 1945, the name changes again for ""National union of the Manufacturers and Importers of Essential Oils, Aromatic Products, Almond oil and Almond seed oil."" It was only in 1974 that we became ""Prodarom, National Association of Fragrance Manufacturers."" And finally in June 21, 2012, ""PRODAROM IFRA Member"" National Association of Fragrance Manufacturers. Premium Beauty News - What is the economic influence of Prodarom today? Philippe Massé - 53 companies are Prodarom members, which represents approximately 75% of the French turnover in the sector on a total turnover estimated to about 760 million in 2011 (including 575 million for raw materials and fragrance compounds). For your information, the turnover of the Perfumes and Flavours industry in France is estimated at 1,400 million euros in 2011. The total workforce (Flavours and Perfumes) is estimated at 6,000 employees. Premium Beauty News - What are the main activities of your members? Philippe Massé - They are quite large. They concern mainly the production of extracts from natural aromatic sources (vegetable and animal); the purification of these extracts, the extraction of specific chemicals (isolates) from natural extracts; the modification of the isolates by chemical means (hemi-synthesis); the synthesis of specific aromatic chemical (synthetic) and, of course, in the commercialisation of these different ingredients, or of various combinations of these ingredients (""bases"" - ""specialities""); without forgetting the creation and commercialisation of ""fragrance compounds"", finally of complex mixtures made up of some of the above mentioned different ingredients, to be used as such for various  finished products (fine fragrances, cosmetic products, soaps, household cleaning products…). Premium Beauty News - What are finally your role and mission? Philippe Massé - Prodarom is a sectoral trade union within the Union of Chemical Industries. It insures for all its members at the national level the representation as well as the defence of interests of this industry with supervisory authorities, that is to say the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the Ministry of Productive Adjustment and the Ministry of Agriculture. But also with the Ministry of Social Affairs and of Health, the Ministry of Labour, employment, vocational training and social dialogue, the Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy. We represent the profession with numerous organizations, including the UIC (Union of Chemical Industries), the MEDEF (Mouvement des Entreprises de France), the ANSES (National Agency for Sanitary Safety, the merger between the AFSSA and the AFSSET), the MSNA (formerly AFSSAPS, the French Agency for Sanitary Safety of Health Products), without forgetting the FEBEA (French trade association representing cosmetic manufacturers/Regulatory Department) the COSMED (Association of the Cosmetic industry), the AFISE (French association of detergents, and industry maintenance products). Same representation with the Universities, and the ISIPCA for which Prodarom is a Member of the Management Board and a member of the Development Council. Prodarom is also a member of the PPAM (medicinal aromatic and fragrance plants) Specialized Council of FranceAgriMer (National organization on agricultural and fisheries products), and of the ICIHEF (Interprofessional Committee of French Essential Oil). Premium Beauty News - You also have a representation at the European and even international level? Philippe Massé - Absolutely! We defend the profession with community authorities, and, of course, at the international level by means of our representation to the IFRA (International Fragrance Association), which ensures the consistency of professional activities and measures of self-discipline concerning these activities.
I would also like to mention the excellent contacts of Prodarom with the EFEO (European Federation for Essential Oils), which insures the collection and dissemination from and to its members of information from whatever source and whatever nature (legislation, statistics...). Premium Beauty News - Not to mention your activity at the local level! Philippe Massé - As part of this local activity, we provide our Members with the representation with Municipal, Departmental, Regional, European, Authorities, that is to say, the elected officials (mayors/MPs/Senators), the Regional Council of the Environment and Technological and Health Hazards (CODERST), occupational medicine, the DREAL (Regional Directorates of the Environment, Land-Use Planning, and Housing), the CCI (Chamber of Commerce and Industry) and the Employers’ Union UPE 06. Our Committees within Prodarom are the CES (Committee of Social Studies, in charge of the harmonization of the social treatment of employees in this industry), the COTARP (Technical committee of Application of Regulations in Perfumery), whose main role is to encourage companies to take a standpoint concerning perfumery regulations, the CST (Scientific and Technical Committee, which unites analysis specialists, in charge of devising analytical methods for this industry. It plays a major role in the field of French standardization (AFNOR) and international standardization (ISO) of essential oils, and the GT HSE (Hygiene-Health-Environment Working Group), the ASFO (Organisation for Vocational Training, which specializes in the Aromatic field), the GIP (Grasse Institute of Perfumery, a Division of ASFO, is an association originating from Prodarom). Premium Beauty News - You even have your own training organization! Philippe Massé - The world of perfumes, aromas and of cosmetics is constantly evolving, both on the technological and regulatory level and in terms of ingredients. For companies in the industry, these mutations result in real challenges to confront every day. Since 1972, the ASFO-Grasse has set itself the objective to accompany, advise and train all actors of the branch. Because we are convinced that the success of a business is inseparable from the level of competence of its employees. Therefore, the ASFO-Grasse assists companies specialised in fine chemicals at all levels of the forward-looking management cycle of employment and skills: – by carrying out studies on employment and qualification (in partnership with the DDTEFP, the PASS cluster), 
– by participating in the recruitment and qualification of future employees in the branch (sandwich courses), 
– by participating in the improvement of knowledge and skills of current employees (continued training, individual training leave), 
– by helping some employees to acquire qualifications or diplomas (educational leave or validation of job experience), 
– by intervening in difficult times to anticipate industrial changes and prepare professional transitions,
– by participating in the reintegration of jobseekers (in partnership with the pole Employment and the PACA Regional Council), 
– by extending around the world the reputation of Grasse, the capital of perfume, through the International School of Perfumery (Grasse Institute of Perfumery). Training courses at the GIP aim to develop the basic knowledge required to apprehend the different steps leading to the creation of a perfume, to acquire a knowledge in raw materials and know how to use them wisely, particularly natural materials for which Grasse has long been renowned, to learn the language of perfumers and know how to classify and recognise the main fragrance groups, to discover and know how to create harmonies which are the essence of the art of composition, to learn the subtle art of composition. But other disciplines fundamental to the job of a perfume-creator are also covered. The knowledge of international regulations in perfumes and cosmetics, the mastery of the modern principles of analysis (gas chromatography and mass spectrometry), functional perfumery (shampoos, shower gels, creams...) are also part of the curriculum. Premium Beauty News - How long does this training lasts, and what is the cost of it? Philippe Massé - The training of a student will last nine months, from February to June and September to December. It includes 972 hours of training in English given by professionals (perfumers - designers or technicians), interspersed with visits to factories, laboratories and perfume plants growers (jasmine, May rose, lavender, mimosa...). The cost is of 11,900 euros. The number is limited to 12 students, selected for their olfactory talents and creativity. To date 115 students of 27 different nationalities followed the courses with a placement rate of over 90%. Premium Beauty News - A word on the PASS cluster and the ERINI platform in which Prodarom is involved. What is the situation? Philippe Massé - You know that the PASS cluster aims to become an international reference centre for the characterization, evaluation and production of natural extracts used in the aromatic and cosmetics industry. The PASS cluster is based on vertical integration. It is composed of the entire value chain of this industry, historically present throughout the region, from the cultivation of aromatic and perfume plants to the production of aromatic ingredients and their formulation into finished products. These aromatic ingredients are aimed at four major industrial markets: fine perfumery, cosmetics, detergents and food products. In addition, the mastery of complex natural substances is an undeniable challenge for the industry. It requires indeed technologies and a scientific expertise of the highest level to meet the needs of characterization, quantification and authentication of extracts. The ERINI platform was created specifically to meet this need, by the PASS (Parfums Arômes Senteurs, Saveurs) competitiveness cluster, the CNRS, the Nice Sophia Antipolis University and Prodarom. It is located in Grasse, in the Espace Jacques-Louis Lions, on the emblematic site of the former Roure factory, next to the InnovaGrasse (innovative business incubator) and of the Master Foqual (Formulation Quality Analysis). The aim of this platform, a public and private research partnership structure, is to become an international laboratory of excellence in the field of characterization of natural extracts, with three major research themes: – The study of degradation mechanisms of products from the aromatic industry (i.e. oxidation reactions) and the characterization of markers of aging and / or potentially allergenic-by-products.
– Identification and quantification of substances in the extracts, to improve on the one hand the development of natural raw materials towards other markets (pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, etc..), and on the other hand, control their quality (research or products or of contamination residues).
– The authentication of the natural (naturalness) to guarantee the origin and quality of extracts, and thus thwart fraudulent transactions."
Kanebo starts its revolution,"On November 13, Masumi Natsusaka, president of Kanebo presented in Tokyo the new ambitions of the second Japanese cosmetics maker. For the first time since its acquisition by Kao in 2005, Kanebo Cosmetics is initiating a true revolution, with a main driver: achieving the internationalization of the group. While Kanebo (16.5% market share) and Kao (6.3%) are now almost on a par in Japan with Shiseido (23.7% market share), the two groups did not succeeded to equal the performance of their compatriot abroad. Unfortunately, if the Japanese cosmetics market remains the second in size after the United States, it has almost ceased growing in value since 2002 and has even started a slight decline since 2009. And the prospects are not encouraging.  The aging Japan’s population has been decreasing since 2005, which will hinder any market recovery.  At the same time competition increased, with the entry of new players such as Fuji Films, with the brand Astalift or Ajinomoto, a food giant, and even Suntory, maker of the famous Japanese beer on the cosmetic-food segment. In this context, Kanebo wants to catch growth abroad by entering in the race already underway between major global cosmetic players. The announcement is not new, but this time the Japanese group seems to be ready to adopt the decisions that are necessary to succeed. Masumi Natsusaka has built its strategy for 2015 upon three main axes: the rationalization and reduction of the group’s portfolio of brands, the strengthening of the group’s position on its home market, and the strong development of the group’s international business. The first step is probably the most painful. While the group currently manages an impressive number of brands [1] in all segments of the market, it will drastically reduce their number to a total of twelve key brands, from which will emerge five strategic brands that have a strong global potential. Some lines will therefore be stopped or merged with similar ones. Thus, Kanebo will certainly not cease marketing whitening products but should merge its Blanchir brand within a stronger one. The five global brands are Sensai, Kanebo (now known as Impress), Lunasol, Kate and Freshel.  Therefore, on overseas markets, the Kanebo signature will no longer be disseminated on all product lines and will become a brand by itself. The remaining seven brands (Twany, Lissage, Coffret d’Or, Milano Collection, Evita, and a counselling skin care brand and a counselling hair care brand) will be focused on the Japanese market. Indeed, Masumi Natsusaka is well aware that it is also in Japan that he will win the battle for the group’s globalization. The equation is quite simple: to enhance the group’s profitability on its domestic market in order to fund its global development. While Kanebo’s operating profitability is currently at 6%, Natsusaka wants to reach 10% in 2015. In a distribution environment undergoing enormous changes with the advent of on-line retailing, Kanebo Cosmetics is re-focusing on counselling, the starting point of its business, as source of competitive advantage. Eventually, the Japanese group is seeking to achieve dramatic growth in its overseas sales.  Its top priority is the expansion of its Asian business, including China. To facilitate this, Kanebo is going to build an R&D structure that will permit local product development based on the technology appropriate to each region.  The group should turn to new suppliers who can offer high quality technology at more competitive prices than in Japan. To date, in addition to Japan, Kanebo makes business in 55 countries but only 10% of its sales are made abroad.  Masumi Natsusaka targets an overseas sales ratio of 15% by 2015, and 30% by 2020 at the latest."
Make-up: Polish company Bell focuses on investing in production equipment,"Quite a remarkable success for this family-run company founded thirty years ago by the Pałyska family, still the owner to date, and who has carved a place for itself over time both around its own make-up brand Bell, but also, increasingly, through its subcontracting activity which combined operates on forty markets and with one of its characteristics being the almost total integration, from the manufacturing of its proprietary formulas to the production of packaging (six twenty injection moulding machines). Bell’s main customers for outsourcing are German companies and those of Central and Western Europe. ""But we are stepping up our commercial presence in both the United States and Asia,"" we were told at the Jozefow headquarters. Regarding Bell brand, products are available in more and more countries around the world, not only in Europe but also in Arabic and Asian markets. “Topping the list of products coming from the subcontracting, lipgloss and lipstick are bestsellers and these are produced in highest volumes. But we offer the full array of make-up products,"" explains the officials. “Each season we create new products to bring a palette of brilliant and vivid hues. We provide high-quality services in contract manufacturing of colour cosmetics. Established in 1983, we were the first colour cosmetic brand in Poland with the full make-up range. Paying attention to quality, both in production and service is our priority. We select ingredients and use only high quality raw materials from well-known, verified suppliers. All finished products, raw materials and components are controlled by qualified quality control department. Bell also cooperates with independent, external laboratories and research institutions. All products are produced according to EU legal regulations.” A subcontracting activity whose development requires constant investments. Hence the arrival next year of production machines ‘back injection’, ‘multi-colour pressed powder’ and ‘multi-colour liquid powder’, whose main advantages stands in a perfect mastery of the filling of colour cosmetics in their packaging, the possibility to inject several hues and/or textures at the same time, to achieve extremely varied patterns since it’s possible to inject in a hollow imprint, and, in the end, obtain a very high quality product. Bell focuses on investing in new machines and equipment to increase its production capacity and products’ quality. The plans of growth and investments concern also packaging production and decoration area, as Bell has its own packaging and decoration production."
Joko Private Label: A new corporate image for Christmas,"Joko was created twenty years ago by the Kosyl couple, with in the beginning the aim to develop their own brand.  However, Gregory and Elizabeth soon realized that the subcontracting activity would also provide them the desired progression. Actually, in 2011 Joko Private Label accounted in the end for up to 95% of the Group’s turnover. ""Our positioning in this area is clear,"" explains Anna Diaczenko, Head of Marketing, ""We work for large companies that rely on subcontractors with large volumes of production. We offer the full range of make-up products: from lipstick to pressed and/or cast powders including mascaras, lip glosses, concealers, foundations, eyeliners, eyeshadows and blushes...” Joko production capacity is really impressive and it is rising year after year, along with its investments in new automated machines. And the two production units located in Wolomin (30 km from the centre of Warsaw) have nothing to envy to the most modern units in other countries of the European Union. “The equipment used to manufacture the lipsticks, the powders, the hot filled products are all latest-generation machines. The workshop has just received a brand new Taiwanese back injection machine which is currently being tested and which will be running in a few days. Some additional productive investments are earmarked for 2013 with, among others, the automation of the assembly shop.” The staff at Wolomin has every reason of being proud to display the whole battery of tests (preservatives, stability tests, skin tests, compliance with the applicable legislation) to which the microbiology laboratory and quality control laboratory submit the products.

Schwan Cosmetics on the rise,"Premium Beauty News - A good development for your Group during the year 2011/2012 which is reflected in the figures. Barbara Bauer-Kropf - Indeed! During the fiscal year 2011/12 (which ended June 30th) the Schwan-STABILO Group exceeded the turnover threshold of half a billion euros for the first time, achieving sales of 503 million euros (previous year: 462 million euros) and an increase of 9%. Gains were once again made in all areas of business: Cosmetics rose by 10.0%, STABILO by 0.4%, and Outdoor by 29.5%.The Cosmetics division showed a particularly successful development, exhibiting organic growth, especially in Latin America and Asia. Schwan Cosmetics was able to significantly expand its business during the fiscal year 2011/12. Compared to previous year (241 million euros), the turnover increased by 10% to 266 million euros. This continued the successful trend of recent years; viewed over three years, turnover has increased by almost 50%. For the cosmetics business, investments amounted to 22.1 million euros, of which 14.7 million euros alone were for the Heroldsberg site. The lion’s share of these investments went into the development and industrialisation of new products. The markets of the Asia-Pacific region have experienced unprecedented growth in recent years and are seen as the most dynamic growth region in the world. Increasing independence from the USA and Europe driven by a fast-developing domestic market and a growing, prosperous middle-class mean that high growth rates are also expected for the future. For decades, Western Europe has been the most important sales region for Schwan Cosmetics after North America. Slowly however, the markets of Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe and the Middle East are collectively assuming second place among the most important sales regions in the world. Premium Beauty News - The year 2012 was also marked by the 25th anniversary of the famous B-Matic! Barbara Bauer-Kropf - That’s right! 25 years ago Schwan Cosmetics invented a very special cosmetic pencil with a new kind of twist mechanism: The technology, which involved pouring the bulk directly into the plastic casing of the mechanical pencil, was considered revolutionary. This eye and lip liner remains one of the products with the highest production level at the Heroldsberg site. In the meantime, over half a billion B-Matic pencils have been sold worldwide. Since the invention of this pencil 25 years ago, Schwan Cosmetics has been able to beautify eyes over 400 billion times all over the world as each pencil can be used around 800 times. To celebrate the pencil’s birthday this past summer, employees released more than 700 balloons as a symbolic greeting to Cosmetics consumers throughout the world. Premium Beauty News - 2012, a year also marked by several investments. Barbara Bauer-Kropf - In the past fiscal year 2011/12, the Schwan-STABILO Group’s investments totaled 45 million euros with a focus on new products. Furthermore, a significant portion of this figure was invested in construction. As such, cosmetics manufacture in Mexico is currently being expanded by means of a new factory in Toluca. Work continues on the construction of the Deuter (Gerstofen) logistics and administration building. And at company headquarters in Heroldsberg, preparations are underway for a new STABILO building which will also house a new IT centre to cater to the needs of the entire company. In Germany the group created a further 110 jobs so that a total of 1,850 people are now employed there. At the end of the fiscal year the number of employees stood at 4,390 worldwide. Premium Beauty News - And what is your insight for the near future? Barbara Bauer-Kropf - Like our Group Managing Director, Ulrich Griebel, expressed it very well, we are carefully observing the uncertain global economic situation and, with three completely different sectors, we certainly have plenty to occupy ourselves with. Nonetheless, as a family-owned company we feel well equipped for the task ahead, and continue to trust in our competence in dealing with many challenges, diverse markets and different brands."
"“Brazil is the hottest market in the world at the moment,” Emanuelly Batisti, Shiseido Brasil","Sueli Ortega - What are your next investment plans in Brazil? Emanuelly Batisti -  Actually, Brazil is the hottest market in the world at the moment, not only for Shiseido, but for all brands seeking growth. We have just received in the country several scientists of the group coming from Japan, to conduct researches on the skin and hair of Brazilian women. The purpose was to develop more specific products addressing the needs of this market, considering the local variety of phenotypes. Shiseido is recognized as one of the companies that invest the most in research worldwide. We have 14 research centres around the world. Shiseido was granted several awards worldwide, because of the level of research the group develops, and its numerous patents and the development of raw materials. In a growing market such as Brazil, it could not be different. We conducted consumer tests with about 200 persons, using state of the art equipment. Our team of scientists has investigated various topics of analysis. For instance, they used high-definition pictures to measure the amount of cilia that a woman has, and their thickness, in order to develop products adapted to their needs. Sueli Ortega - What are the main events of your presence in Brazil? Emanuelly Batisti -  The company has been in Brazil since 1996 and created its Brazilian subsidiary in 2000. As far as the Shiseido brand is concerned, it was launched in 1872. We are celebrating its 140th anniversary this year. We have scheduled worldwide celebrations. In Brazil, the celebrations include launches of limited editions, cultural and entertainment actions, etc. This year was also marked by the launch of new Shiseido brands in Brazil: bareMinerals, a brand of our US subsidiary Bare Escentuals, and Nars, which was acquired by Shiseido in 2000. Sueli Ortega - What is the purpose of these launches in terms of concept and distribution? Emanuelly Batisti - Both are makeup brand, but they have different proposals. Nars has more fashion appeal, a bolder and trendier positioning. It is colourful and vibrant. On the other hand, bareMinerals has a more natural appeal, it’s makeup line that reaches a younger audience. These brands have a different positioning than the Shiseido brand, which is almost a functional makeup line, providing both makeup and treatment, thus benefitting the skin, whether it is dry or oily. It also offers anti-ageing features. For instance, lipsticks contain hyaluronic acid. In Brazil, Shiseido is distributed in leading prestige perfumeries and pharmacies, such as Onofre, and also at Sephora.  Altogether there are 170 sale points in Brazil. It is a selective distribution that reaches 100% of Brazilian regions, besides the sales of e-commerce. On the contrary, bareMinerals is sold in its own shops and at Sephora. There are no franchises, but only brand stores. And Nars is an exclusive brand brought to Brazil for Sephora. Sueli Ortega - What are Shiseido’s best sellers in Brazil? Emanuelly Batisti - What sells most are the skincare products. Skincare is the great strength of the brand in the country. We are the second skincare brand best sold in Brazil, according to a research by Segmenta. Sueli Ortega - And what about the fragrance market? Emanuelly Batisti -  Shiseido Brazil only offers its Zen fragrance in the country. However, global brands belonging to the group, such as Issey Miyake, Jean Paul Gaultier, Narciso Rodriguez, Elie Saab, are also marketed in Brazil through independent distributors. Sueli Ortega - What are the launches planned for the country this year? Emanuelly Batisti -  Shiseido will launch commemorative editions, such as a perfume with an unique scent that arrives already in October, Eau Dermine, which was the first scent launched by Shiseido. It comes back with the original packaging, totally vintage, for collectors. We will launch other products line, as a 3 in 1 sunscreen that protects face, body and hair. We will launch an anti-aging serum for men, a product for the eye area for women over 40 years and a makeup collection. There will be many releases by November this year."
L’Oréal gets to know Indian consumers,"L’Oréal has been present in India for 18 years with a portfolio of 15 brands, growing at an average annual growth rate of 30%. The Group is number 3 of the beauty sector in India, with 10% market share in urban areas [1]. In order to cater to this market optimally, the cosmetics Group has launched several brands covering various product categories, including: mass consumer brands Garnier, L’Oréal Paris and Maybelline New York; luxury brands Lancôme, Yves Saint Laurent, Kiehl’s, Ralph Lauren, Giorgio Armani and Diesel; professional brands like L’Oréal Professionnel, Matrix, Kérastase and Kéraskin Esthetics for salons and pharmacy brands Vichy and La Roche-Posay. “L’Oréal’s rapid success in India can be explained by its ability to adapt to the demands of a market where cosmetic routines and purchases are firmly anchored in tradition,” explains the French cosmetics giant.  For instance, in order to take into account local standards of living, the range of packaging options - and therefore of prices - has been widened. Thus, Garnier Fructis shampoos are available in sachets costing 1.5 rupees (0.02 euros). Of course, such prices are only possible through local production and raw materials supply, in particular with the Pune plant that supplies nearly 85% of L’Oreal’s sales in India.  Established in India since 1994, Garnier has succeeded in becoming the leading multi-category beauty brand in the country, with nearly 750,000 points of sale, both in the traditional network of neighbourhood shops (which account for 82% of L’Oréal sales in India) and in the modern supermarket network (accounting for 18%). To better understand the aspirations of the Indian middle class, L’Oréal took a decisive step two years ago when it decided to set up a research and innovation centre with evaluation and formulation laboratories in Mumbai. Thanks to a key consumer insight, L’Oréal seized the opportunity to meet the needs of this demanding clientele by offering Indian women products that are modern and innovative yet specific to their existing beauty habits. Thus, Several essential products from the Indian beauty culture have inspired the French multinational’s range.  For instance, the importance of hair care in India was behind the Garnier launch of a Fructis 2-in-1 shampoo (shampoo + hair oil), specially designed according to the tradition of oiled hair.  Similarly, Garnier Color Naturals coloration was introduced as a modern alternative to traditional coloration with henna. As per the top-selling Colossal Kajal from Maybelline New York, it was inspired obviously by women’s use of traditional kajal to line their eyes. Although cosmetics spending is still relatively low in India, in particular if we consider the overall population, the outlook is encouraging.  The Indian cosmetics market registered impressive sales worth Rs 264.1 billion (US$ 4.75 billion) in 2011. The industry is estimated to expand at a compound aggregate growth rate (CAGR) of around 17 per cent during 2011-2015, according to RNCOS latest research report. Boosted by the growing importance consumers give to their appearance, it has enjoyed double-digit growth in recent years (+13% in 2010), recording the highest growth of any country in the Asia-Pacific region."
Cosmetic brushes: The Raphael/Max Sauer Saga,"Premium Beauty News - A Industrial family saga obviously begins with a story. Pascal Goossens - Indeed, the origin of the current Max Sauer company dates back to 1793 in Paris. Today, it is the oldest factory in Europe for the maufacture of fine brushes. It is in Paris, just a stone’s throw from the Pont Neuf, that Mr. Parent establishes his brush factory in 1793. The French company manages to develop itself in spite of troubled times in connection with the Revolution, the Empire and the Restoration. The activity continues from 1820 to 1859 with the company changing hands. Then, in 1859, at the age of 34, Charles Sauer acquires the company and relocates it in Oinville, 50 km from Paris. His son, Max Auguste Sauer, undertakes the construction between 1895 and 1900 of a highly modern steam plant in Hardricourt. It was not until 1925 that the manufacture of fine brushes was transferred to Saint-Brieuc by Max Sauer Jr. After the death of Max Sauer in 1960, the Max Sauer Company, directed by Michel and Gérard Sauer is transferred in 1967 in a new factory which is expanded in 1973, 1987 and 1991. The Berge Artists materials, (founded 1920): canvas products-rolls, pre-streched, canvas boards, as well as Artists’ colours, Art papers and other Artists materials from Sennelier (in 1887), are acquired and now manufactured in Brittany. All products are currently distributed in more than 55 countries around the world. With the fifth generation, the Company’s succession is now represented by Eric Sauer since 1987. Innovation, research and development, are combined to tradition and know-how. Family rigour in the management, team-work, superlative quality and customer service all remain the top priorities of the Max Sauer Company. Premium Beauty News - In fact, when did the company exactly begin the purely ""cosmetic"" activity? And what is the difference between artists brushesfrom the ones intended for applications on the face, eyes and lips? Pascal Goossens - It goes back to more than fifty years, when major cosmetic brands asked us to manufacture their branded brushes. The market naturally developed thereafter. The two main differences concern firstly the nature of the hairs used. Indeed, the choice of the hair or of the fibre is related to the use of the brush, depending of applications and textures. Then shapes are different, also depending of the type of application. Premium Beauty News - Brush designing and manufacturing truly concerns an almost unique area of expertise. To which times do the very first brushes date back? Pascal Goossens - The exact date of manufacture of the first artists’ brushes in France is unknown. In the past, artists would learn to make their own brushes as well as their own colours. 2000 years BC, the Chinese had the idea of inserting natural hairs into bamboos, to write their ideograms. Then in 1730, appeared metal ferrules. It was not until shortly before 1789 that the first workshops, then factories started to appear. French manufacturing had at the beginning a very large monopoly, then Germans from Nürnberg came to learn the French technology. This is why the French form of artist brushes is still the most used around the world. Our brushes are made by highly skilled workers, the ""pincelières"". Products are controlled at each stage of the manufacturing process. Handles and ferrules are selected to offer solid brushes with a flawless finish. The tradition and know-how of our brush makers has been passed on from generation to generation and the extreme care we take to prepare the fine hairs before the manufacturing stages result in supreme quality for the end user. More than 30 people are required for the manufacture of a brush which requires on average three weeks preparation before the brush is completed. The tuft is never cut but made entirely by hand. Extra-fine or fine bristles are conical and have a unique natural ""flag"" which gives the brush its incomparable softness particularly appreciated for all cosmetic applications. Premium Beauty News - It is was rather surprising, in fact to see, while visiting you, that this ""cosmetic"" activity represented nearly a third of your business and that ""discretion"" forced you to create a dedicated website only in a few days! Pascal Goossens - That is true, but we work with major brands and our relationships are both very old and based on trust and loyalty. And it is also in very close partnership with them that we develop a lot of novelties in the form of fully customized products. Premium Beauty News - The make-up brush seems to have been given a real lease of life. Pascal Goossens - Absolutely! And professional make-up Artists, very demanding in terms of quality, are the ones that help the market move forward with quality products. We have developed a true specialty in custom-made brushes. Premium Beauty News - What main industrial and/or commercial investments have you planed in the coming months? Pascal Goossens - We want to focus our efforts on international development which today represents 35% of our cosmetic activity (in direct sales, apart from sales performed abroad which are conducted by our clients). Its among others, at this level that our new website will enable us to showcase our long standing expertise."
Perfumers want to defend the “accomplishments of the nose”,"The French fragrance community gathered last week in the former Potocki Palace, where is now seated the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry, to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the French Perfumers Society (SFP), which counts 800 members, including 300 perfumers, that is to say nearly half of the World’s ""noses"". The celebration was marked by three main events:  the launch of a rose variety selected for its scent with the participation SFP members and called the “Rose des Parfumeurs”, the founding of the International Circle of Perfumer-Creators, and the announcement of the winner of the 2012 International Perfumer-Creator Award, Virginie Armand, perfumer at Argenville. However, in the background of the festivities, discussions were focusing on the protection of fragrance creations. Would a smell of rebellion be rising among the usually so quiet noses community? The reason? To date, a fragrance is not considered an intellectual work, but only the mere result of a specific technical know-how. Consequently, it does not benefit from the protection of intellectual property rights. In France, the Court of Cassation, the appellate court of the highest instance, has never changed its opinion on this matter. On two occasions, in 2006 and 2008, despite a contrary opinion by the Paris Court of Appeal, the Court of Cassation has ruled that: ""the fragrance of a perfume, which is the result of the mere implementation of know-how, does not constitute the creation of a form of expression that can benefit from copyright protection as an intellectual work."" [1] Should we follow the reasoning of the Court of Cassation, composing a fragrance would essentially require technical knowledge and the part of the author’s personality would be too low for considering it an original creative work. For anyone who knows a little bit the art perfumery and the way perfumers are working, that does not make sense! According to Matthieu Bourgeois, Associate Lawyer operating mainly in the field of intellectual property rights at the KGA law firm in Paris, there may be another explanation.  ""The Court’s questionable position is probably due to judges being cautious about having to cope with very difficult debates regarding the similarity between two close fragrances,"" he says. ""The Court of Cassation apparently thinks that judges would have hardly any means to evaluate similarities, since - let’s not forget it - smell is and remains, in our society, human’s less developed sense or, in any case, the most subjective and unequally shared.” They may lack the support of judges, but perfumers have gained the support of art connoisseurs.  Last January, the French Minister of Culture at the moment, Frédéric Mitterrand, during a ceremony in which he awarded the Medal of Arts and Letters to six illustrious perfumers, expressed his desire to see “the accomplishments of the nose recognized on par with the accomplishments of the hand.” It is the project a group of perfumers decided to tackle.  The proposal by Maurice Maurin and Raymond Chaillan to create an International Circle of Perfumer-Creators [2], with the mission to enhance, promote and defend the profession of perfumer, thus immediately received wide support. The Circle will seek to unite all perfumer-creators, whether independent or under contract to composition houses or luxury brands, and regardless their country of residence. A “Committee of Elders” uniting 29 perfumers, around the SFP president, has been settled and the first plenary session should be held soon, in order to, as Raymond Chaillan said, “to define and defend this difficult and often denigrated profession, (…) to voice our concern about the ongoing reduction of our palette of natural ingredients, to sound the alarm that creativity is in danger, reaching its limits — that all of the warning lights are on red.” To be continued…"
"BCM, a member of Alliance Boots, wants to be one of the key players working behind the scenes in the Beauty sector","BCM Cosmétique, which is the BCM factory in France, specialised in the formulation and filling of cosmetic products, continues throughout the years its development and to invest in its factory. With three factories in Europe, employing over 2,000 people, BCM is surely one of the market leaders in the European universe of contract manufacturing, formulating and packing, dedicated to the health and beauty industry. Overview with Marie-Christine Clerc, Sales and Marketing Director of BCM Cosmétique, in France. Premium Beauty News - In fact, the three plants dedicated to products formulation, which are owned by BCM in Europe, are completed by a fourth one focusing on packaging, isn’t it? Marie-Christine Clerc - That’s right! There is an additional factory based in Poland, which specialises in secondary packing, toilet bags and gift assembly. This factory is closely linked to our German plant, which is dedicated to the formulation, manufacturing and filling of colour cosmetics and is located near Frankfurt, in Dietzenbach. Premium Beauty News - So, the three formulation and packaging factories are quite complementary? Marie-Christine Clerc - They are! The one in Nottingham in England is mainly dedicated to personal care products, ancillaries, suncare products and baby products .The German factory focuses mainly on colour cosmetics and has a great expertise in lipsticks, powders, and coloured emulsions, then the French factory located in Vitré, in Brittany, can actually manufacture skincare products, ancillaries as well, colour cosmetics, sun care and hot filled technology products (foundation, blush, sticks). Premium Beauty News - This plant in Vitré has undergone and is still undergoing big changes. Marie-Christine Clerc - As you know, it is not the largest manufacturing unit of the Group, which is our factory in Nottingham, but it is the most diversified. You know, we work backstage and the key to what we do is ensuring we anticipate all new trends and translate these into how we formulate, manufacture and fill. Our factory in Vitré epitomizes it perfectly. Main characteristic: BCM in Vitré delivers 30% of its output to Alliance Boots and 70% to major external customers. Second characteristic, BCM is very flexible: under the same roof, we run small batches of premium brands with sophisticated finishing touches, highly automated filling lines and cutting edge and very efficient equipment. We have set the bar very high at Vitré since at the plant, we are FDA registered manufacturers of OTC products. Our objectives are to be compliant with ISO 22716 and to move towards IFS HPC in tandem with our plant investment over the last two years. We also formulate skin care and colour cosmetics which are Ecocert compliant. Premium Beauty News - In your presentation of this activity in France, you stress on the concept of flexibility and of anticipation of needs. Marie-Christine Clerc - That’s right!  In the Beauty sector it is vital to feel the “Zeitgeist” and anticipate future trends. We not only offer all our know-how in formulation and packaging but we make a point of innovating in offering our own formulas while staying ahead of trends. Several new BCM formulae were patented over the last two years in colour cosmetics. We imbue ourselves in the spirit and the “DNA “of our customers and position ourselves as a source of inspiration and ideas. Our R&D team works closely with our marketing team and project managers based in our Paris office. Anticipating is essential for us in BCM Cosmétique.  As an example, we started working on the compliance with the 2013 New Cosmetics Regulation at the end of 2010 ! We extended our regulation team to reinforce our service offer in terms of establishment of cosmetics files (products safety, innocuousness, efficiency tests, claims…). Moreover, it is very important and vital for us to always have some spare production capacity. Hence the plant investments undertaken each year, for example for the new bulk manufacturing vessel for mascara and foundation which was commissioned at the end of 2010 and a new filling line for mascaras which was installed at the end of last year. Premium Beauty News - Your dual make-up / skincare expertise is a huge asset! Marie-Christine Clerc - There are obviously important bridges between our different areas of expertise, skincare, make up, hot filled technologies…. This offer which is both diversified and complementary is something our customers really appreciate. Premium Beauty News - You presented several new collections at the last Beyond Beauty tradeshow in Paris? Marie-Christine Clerc - Creativity, innovation and experience enable BCM to help brand owners and retailers to develop innovative new products inspired by current and future trends! For Beyond Beauty Paris 2012, the creative approach of BCM intended to be colourful, light, fanciful with the appropriate dose of rigour specific to formulators! At BCM we take a strategic view of the beauty sector by working behind the scenes months in advance to produce some of the most cutting-edge cosmetic formulations available to the market. Every year we anticipate beauty trends and find new inspiration to enlarge our offer. Innovation is at the core of our approach, through our regular COMIT’INOV meetings. For the Beyond Beauty 2012 event, we have focused on five key themes, each with their own direction and spirit: Re Source, Jungle Mania, Urban Wild, Grand Canyon and Sun Reflex. For RE SOURCE, it is a need of wellbeing and harmony. The return to a raw natural beauty, which is pure and Japanese-inspired. The ""Healthy Nude"" is back but updated to give an ultra-sophisticated and refined look. It’s all in the art of creating a flawless and balanced look. The spotlight is on the radiant complexion. The facial features are highlighted by a colour pop of neon coral to awaken the minimalist look. Suitable for everyday, RE SOURCE consists of a range of delicate and sensual products that are “good for the skin” with natural, multi-functional formulas. For JUNGLE MANIA, it is blending lush verdant hues with classic forties style: the desire to escape to an exotic haven, where there is a profusion of exotic flowers and lush foliage. A return to the 1940s beauty era with a more graphic look including solid colours and clean lines. JUNGLE MANIA incorporates green and neutral tones to create a tropical woody style
reminiscent of the 40s. The focus of this look is the architecture of the face, using bold graphic colours and sweeping lines to accentuate the eyes, lashes and brows. For URBAN WILD, it is an instinctive and creative palette that echoes the vibe of the city.  A range of products inspired by ultra colourful street art and the gritty feel of the urban streets. Vinyl textures and powders with amazing cool effects can be applied as a sweep of solid colour or as a wash of lighter pigment. URBAN WILD is punchy, vibrant and playful with richly coloured pigments. For GRAND CANYON, it is an infusion of Light: gold highlights accentuate a summer tan and brighten hair from the first rays of the sun, a wash of pink colour accentuated with copper highlights creates a bright healthy glow for all skin tones. The hair is the key focus, adorned with gold leaves, hair jewellery, or a delicate tiara to echo the precious metals in this romantic-rock look. For SUN REFLEX, as you know, BCM has a rich heritage in sun care (70 years’ experience in the UK). For summer 2013, BCM suggests a complete new range of solar products, the result of an 18 month research project. SUN REFLEX provides a wide range of formulations (creams, lotions and sprays) from focused facial skincare products with high protections SPF50+ to SPF 30 formulations and after-sun products."
"Ancorotti Cosmetics: A 2012 year, set to be a record year!","""There is no secret in this increase, assures Renato Ancorotti, quality products well suited to demand and an industrial tool that we are committed in maintaining at the highest level."" As a proof of this, the opening of new buildings in the same industrial zone as the bulk production plant. Buildings, five in total, which have mushroomed to host some 9 filling machines and storage areas. Production capacity: 4 tons of bulk/day and more than 130,000 pieces/day (mascara and/or lipgloss) in one shift. ""It’s as simple as that, explains Ancorotti, a second shift and figures are doubled!

ABC Texture: always an open ear!,"Premium Beauty News -  Creating successfully one’s business from scratch, a performance which seems particularly difficult nowadays? Louisette Bourdin - It is not that easy it is true! But we are a living example. Not only It is possible but it is also desirable for the sustainability of quality in the cosmetics industry. Premium Beauty News -  From beginning to end, you initiated a voluntarily original process. If only for the design of the plant itself… Louisette Bourdin - You’re right! Everything was devised at Saint-Brieuc with a practical focus on sustainable development. This impacted the materials which were used to build the plant, the heating system and hot water supply, the lighting of premises favouring natural light etc. In addition, our assets - industrially speaking - are a fleet of machines well adapted to both small and large batches. Hence, for foaming and fluid emulsions we have a batch ranging from 100 kg to 2.2 tonnes. And for foundations, mascaras, creams emulsions and cast products of batch ranging from 50 kg to 600 kg. We also have a 10 kg to 50 kg vacuum pilot for lipsticks. Of course we control all stages of manufacturing in compliance with GMP rules. Our factory benefits of the ""High Environmental Quality"" standards and we have a full traceability of our products via an ERP. Premium Beauty News - But it is not limited to machines, it is mostly a question of know-how! Louisette Bourdin - It is vital! The hedonic dimension of each cosmetic preparation involves the creation of new sensations and galenic forms, and a good knowledge of traditional textures. Through the development of an experiential marketing, my wish was that we really shifted to a higher dimension in terms of cosmetic services. Starting from a texture briefing, we define all aspects of the product, from its skin touch to its residual film, also taking into consideration hold, application and absorption time. Our priority is to be responsive to our customer’s expectations in order to better meet their specific needs. We develop exclusive creations of tailor-made shades and textures. With this sensory marketing approach, we intend to offer our customers new, tailored and customized solutions. Our customers also benefit from our international experience. Our overseas activity enriches our adaptability regarding each country’s quality standards. Products formulated by our engineers, are subjected to thorough controls and undergo extensive tests to ensure the utmost quality: – microbiological tests,
– safety tests,
– stability tests,
– efficiency tests. While creating the products, our engineers will take care of gathering the beneficial and active properties of the raw materials and make sure to preserve the efficiency of each active ingredient. We develop tailor-made offers to meet expectations in connection with the specificity of each sector and each customer. Our passion is to create new formulas and new products, and to draw our resources from healthy products with vibrant, pearlescent and subtle colours. Our aim is to provide our customers with the natural benefits of efficient products. The smoothness of a cream, the fluidity of a foundation, the softness of a powder texture... At ABC, we recreate emotions through the match of enthralling textures, delicate fragrances and sensual colours, arousing new sensations. Natural and reassuring, they reflect the complicity of traditional know-how with intensely magical moments. Our mastery in the formulation of various specific skincare products (face, body, sun care...) generates reliable products and is a guarantee for our customers to benefit from the latest innovations and from all our know-how dedicated to their well-being. Premium Beauty News - What is today in your activity the share between skincare products, sunscreens and make up? How much does export account for? Pierre-Henry Mercier - Sun care products alone represent 50% of our activity, followed by make-up (30%) and then skincare (20%). The export share is still potential (20%), but it has sometimes reached 60%. Premium Beauty News - Innovation is truly a second nature! A few examples? Pierre-Henry Mercier - Absolutely! And, as Louisette Bourdin explained before, we want to use all the assets we have to be successful. In 2005, we developed a no rinse cleansing gel, quite a technical feat at the time. In 2006, it was the turn for octocrylene-free sunscreens. We also presented in 2011 a BB Cream with encapsulated pigments and, more recently, a lipstick capable of reactivating the gloss using a simple mechanical effect."
Bullier-Pinceaux Léonard: a passion for innovation!,"Premium Beauty News - Innovation is probably what best characterizes your approach? Stéphanie Bullier - That’s true, we can say it has been in the family genes for seven generations. We always pay careful attention to all evolutions, not to say ""revolutions"" that could have an influence on our activity of brush manufacturers. And the development of the ebrush 1S represents to date one of the most original illustration. This brush makes it possible to draw and make up on all capacitive touch screens on the market. The EBrush 1S which was granted the jury’s ""Coup de Cœur"" Award at the last MakeUp in Paris trade show, was designed with the same special care as all our brushes. This brush enables a make-up simulation and gives free rein to creation by opening the door to a whole new vision of make-up, a high-tech vision. Premium Beauty News - People have no idea of the expertise it takes to make a make-up brush? Stéphanie Bullier - As you know, a brush consists of three main parts, the handle, the metal ferrule, and of course, the hair or the fibres. Clearly, the most important part of a brush is the hair. Looking at a hair, one can observe the “root” and the pointed tip called the “flag” It’s the flag that makes the fineness of a brush, so it must be kept intact and never cut. Before beginning the manufacturing of brushes, every hair within a bundle must have its flag at the same level. This is where vibrating machines come into play: the hair is placed in metal rings above which wooden plates operate up and down with rapid but minimum oscillation. To make sure that no hair remains standing out, we dust plaster powder over the bundles to keep the hair slippery. Then the hair is inserted into a first flat and thick bottomed cylindrical brass mould that we tap on a marble slab to let the hair settle down on the flag. The hair is then ready for the manufacture of square ended brushes. For curved or pointed brushes, we use a second specific mould, with a rounded bottom. Once the hair has settled down at the bottom of the mould, we tie the root up with a linen thread. To give the lock a more pointed shape, it is rolled between the fingers. At this stage the dexterity of the worker is fundamental and can only be acquired through years of experience. The fineness of the flag varies with the type of hair. The finer it is, the more expensive the hair is. The other important characteristics of the hair are its springiness, its ability to become straight again after having been bent, and its capacity to retain liquids. There are also a lot of varieties of synthetic fibres that look more and more like natural hair. Brushes are made the same way. 
But what really makes the difference is the proper assembly of the hair, and this is the result of a long standing brush making tradition of which we can be proud. Premium Beauty News - In spite of the international competition and, in particular, coming from regions like Asia or India, it is still possible to keep manufacturing in 2012  make-up brushes in Brittany? Fred Ghenassia - Of course it is possible! Bullier-Pinceaux Léonard employs 35 people, and even if the sourcing is partly done in India for some product lines, our finest pieces are achieved in Saint Brieuc. Remember that there’s up to eight different stages to make a brush. This requires a very specific expertise and excellent workmanship. Our expertise in manufacturing allows us also to innovate in terms of materials used, on the shape of the brush and of the hair or fibres, on the type of handle or the ferrule.... We have for example patented a new form of ferrule enabling a new gesture for the application of the product on the face. Premium Beauty News - Are the times auspicious for make-up brushes? Stéphanie Bullier - Well in fact yes absolutely! And it is mainly due to the professional make-up industry who wanted, a few years ago, to find alternatives to the use, of very average quality brushes coming from emerging countries. These professionals opted for quality which definitely gave us a boost. A phenomenon which then attracted most brands. Quality = expertise, expertise = Bullier/Pinceaux Léonard. Today we work with the most renown brands. We are also specialists in small and medium series, from 100 to 1000 pieces. And the ""cosmetic"" share in our activity keeps growing, reaching now more than 55% of our turnover."
RPM acquires leading nail enamels manufacturer Kirker Enterprises ,"It is quite an event in the nail polish industry. In the context of a booming nail care market, one of the world’s leading manufacturers, the US-based Kirker Enterprises, has just fallen into the hands of RPM International, a holding which was mainly used to operate in the construction industry. Based in Paterson, New Jersey, Kirker has annual sales in excess of US$100 million. Founded more than fifty years ago, the company runs manufacturing facilities in Europe and in the United States.  The company supplies several of the most famous brands and also offers full service options for the creation enamel lines. This acquisition is a very first foray in the cosmetics industry for RPM International, a group of companies specialising in corrosion control and flooring coatings, roofing systems, sealants and specialty chemicals, primarily for building maintenance and improvement. ""Kirker will operate as a stand-alone company within our RPM business group and continue to provide its customers the same level of outstanding service and innovation to which they are accustomed.  Through our many companies, RPM has among the broadest coatings technologies in the world, and Kirker will be able to access these technologies to bring even more innovation to the personal care industry,"" stated Frank C. Sullivan, RPM chairman and chief executive officer.  ""We’re proud to have Kirker’s management team join RPM."" Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed."
"""Being organic is not enough,"" Thierry Logre, Phyt’s","Premium Beauty News - Phyt’s will be celebrating this year its 40th anniversary. It is considered today one of the greatest achievements in natural and organic cosmetics in France. This choice to go green goes back to the very origin of the brand? Thierry Logre - Yes absolutely! From its creation in 1972 by Jean-Paul Llopart a naturopath, and biologist and Rosanne Verlé a beautician, Phyt’s - then called Phytal - made the bet of natural cosmetics and also looked for ways  to avoid the use of preservatives in its products. It was an extremely innovative approach at the time. Also from the outset, the brand targeted the segment of beauty institutes and Jean-Paul Llopart laid the foundations of what he calls the ""Naturo-Esthetique®."" To protect its formulas, Phyt’s introduces single use packaging in the form of disposable glass ampoules. In 1974, a patent was even filed for the conditioning in ampoules of pasty or semi-thick skin care products. Very intuitively and empirically, Jean-Paul Llopart then successfully manages to use other types of packaging, to broaden the possibilities of use of products while avoiding interactions with the external environment. This choice for natural materials is at the heart of the brand identity. This is what led him in 2002 to partner with others precursors for the creation of the Cosmébio charter, which truly launched certification in the field of natural and organic cosmetics. But Phyt’s is before all a brand intended for beauty institutes. This means that even if our products are natural, they are primarily efficient and pleasant to use. They are tested clinically and under dermatological control for claim support. And we do not hesitate to say that we are as efficient as chemistry, because we can prove it. This is what we intend to summarize under the ""Bio-Active Cosmetics"" concept. Premium Beauty News - This efficiency explains your outstanding success while other organic cosmetic brands seem to be struggling to conquer a truly consistent market share? Thierry Logre - Undoubtedly, the commercial development of natural and organic cosmetics has not been up to expectations. From this point of view, we could say that bio is a failure in cosmetics. The market is stagnant and is only boosted by optimized formulas offered by large groups. So why don’t most natural or organic cosmetics manage to line up on the market against their conventional competitors? There are several reasons to this, I think. First because preservatives that can be used in organic cosmetics - the ones which are allowed by Ecocert standards or Qualité France - are often irritating. And secondly they damage the texture of products. For a formulator, they are a real headache. Especially when certain methods for organic formulation, particularly when hydrosol-based formulas are used, make their use necessary. This is one of the reasons why Phyt’s has always advocated for preservative-free cosmetics. But it is a know-how that few companies have mastered. But this explanation is probably not sufficient. After all, some beautiful textures in organic cosmetics are still available. The mistake was to believe that claiming to be bio was enough to sell bio. We saw that, particularly with some private labels, for which in spite of beautiful development investments, neither marketing nor merchandising were equal to ambitions. Premium Beauty News - What are your goals now? Thierry Logre - Today the Phyt’s brand is present in more than 3,000 outlets in France. We are probably the leading brand in this market segment in terms of distribution. As far as sales are concerned, we are at the second or third place. So we still have room for progress to conquer beauty institutes achieving the largest turnover. We are continuing our progression while this market is experiencing a mild recession in France. Clearly, our goal now is to develop our export sales, with two key areas: Asia and North America. In Asia we have managed to increase our turnover twofold every three years. We have sales offices in Seoul and Kuala Lumpur. Today, Korea, Japan and China, including Hong Kong, are drivers for the brand. Malaysia and Singapore recently opened are also promising. As for North America, we are well established in Canada and the United States are now following. Russia, Australia and New Zealand are also important markets for us."
"Jean-Paul Agon (L’Oréal), confident about second-half 2012","""We confirm for 2012 our ambition to outperform the market, and achieve another year of growth in sales, results and profitability,"" summed-up Jean-Paul Agon, L’Oréal’s CEO at the end of the presentation of the French cosmetics giant’s first-half results. While they are slightly below expectations of financial analysts, the 10.5 per cent growth in sales (+6.7 per cent at constant exchange rates) and the 11.4 per cent growth of the operating profit, are even more impressive as they come from all the group’s divisions: +7.3% for professional products, +8.1% for consumer products, +6.6% for active cosmetics and, above all, +17.9% for luxury products (respectively: +2.9%, +4.7%, +5.4% and +10.4% at constant exchange rates). The group has particularly benefited from the strong growth of its luxury division that is dramatically bouncing back after the harsh years that followed the 2008 crisis. Lancôme is reporting double-digit growth, Khiel’s is growing by more than 20%, and Clarisonic by more than 40%. Geographically speaking, the group’s growth is clearly driven by the dynamism of “new markets” (Asia, Pacific, Latin America, Africa, Middle East, Eastern Europe). Outside these areas, L’Oréal’s growth remains strong in North America (+7.3% at constant exchange rates), while the group grew by 0.8% (at constant exchange rates) only in Western Europe. However, Jean-Paul Agon highlights the group gained market share in all geographic areas outperforming the market everywhere. For instance, while the cosmetics market grew by 3 or 4% in the United States, L’Oréal increased sales by 7 to 8%.  Even in France, the group’s home market and the country where it has the biggest market share, L’Oréal grew 4%, in a flat growth context. As far as product categories are concerned: skin care products enjoyed the highest rate, followed by perfumes and makeup, hair care and hair dyes recording lower rates. Of course, as pointed out by Jean-Paul Agon, half-year figures are not particularly representative of the whole-year activity. However, the group confirm its growth target for 2012, as the global cosmetics market should grow by 4%.  “Despite the strong uncertainties of the economic environment, we are considering the second half year with confidence. The cosmetics market is expected to remain buoyant, although we noticed clear signs of slow down during the summer, for instance in the Asian and US luxury markets and in travel retail,"" he said. According to Jean-Paul Agon, the slow down of sales in Asia is particularly spectacular in Korea, where the market for luxury goods, which was growing by 20% two years ago, could record a flat growth this year. The group also noted a significant decrease in passenger flows and consumption in Asian airports. Nevertheless, Jean-Jacques Agon confirms its growth expectations for the group, saying that it is primarily the result of initiatives, innovations and launches from its brands.  In view of scheduled launches, he also anticipates the 4th quarter should outpaced the third one.  However, Jean-Jacques Agon admitted L’Oréal had to adapt its marketing mix in the European countries that are strongly impacted by the crisis. ""In Greece or in Spain, it is probably smarter today to invest in promotional activities rather than in television advertising.”"

The goal is to develop the network faster and we are searching for partners with the same enthusiasm and vigour."
Institut Caméane launches its creative offering,"The strategy of gradual recovery led by Anne Delleur, President of Institut Caméane, paid off. Four years after its return on the market Arcancil can now consider moving a step beyond. The brand, which achieved about 3.5 million euros in turnover of which almost 70% abroad, now offers more than 300 SKUs, distributed in almost thirty countries. In France, Arcancil is available in 150 outlets. ""We have partnerships with strong and highly motivated international distributors, and in markets with high potential but where barriers to entry are lower than in France. We are growing in all countries we have open. The first step was to limit the number of doors to reconstruct a high quality positioning and we are now in a second phase with the expansion of our distribution network in each market. Our goal now is to strengthen Arcancil at all levels, including its distribution in France and the expansion of the product portfolio to double our turnover within three years,"" explains Anne Delleur. To get the best from this new stage and accelerate growth, the President of Institut Caméane made sure to stabilize the company’s financial structure and increase its funding. CAM Cereals, which held 51% of Institut Caméane came out of the capital and Anne Delleur, which controlled the remaining shares, took the majority with the support of French equity funds OSEO and FSI Régions. Thus, the company is ready to address new challenges. Effective May 2012, the end of the exclusive distribution agreement with Galeries Lafayette, should allow Arcancil to reach 300 or 500 doors within three years, therefore increasing its potential on the French territory. Internationally, Arcancil prepares its return to Russia and the rest of Eastern Europe where the brand still enjoys a strong reputation. In this context, Arcancil is broadening its products portfolio and aims to reach more than 500 references within three years. The brand’s displays for eyes products have been completely redesigned and are being deployed at Galeries Lafayette. ""We came out from the usual pattern with mascaras on a side and eyeliners or eye shadows on the other, and we have created an ’Eye Color Bar’, presenting products according to their colour range, not their category. Assorted colours of eye shadows, eyeliners and mascaras are gathered. This new ’Eye Color Bar’ has been tested and facilitates consumers’ choice and encourage impulse buying. In order to further increase the average purchase, we have also placed our Smoky Eyes Cabaret makeup kits, available in eight colour assortments, next to the matching colours in the bar,” says Anne Delleur. Parallel to the development of Arcancil, Institut Caméane is launching its new private labelling division.  ""Our goal is to be recognized as a makeup expert,"" announces Anne Delleur. According to the Institut Caméane’s President, the demand for private make-up brands is particularly strong. “Retailers we work with around the world generally express common requirements: a European brand, possibly French or Italian, with products offering good value for money and the possibility of exclusive agreements. But when we look at the make-up market, brands there are hardly any brands that meet all these criteria. Private labelling therefore comes as the solution.” But in the makeup sector, where 30% of all SKUs are replaced every year, there are challenges to overcome. Not only in terms of development, but also in terms of stock management and merchandising. ""This product category requires real expertise,"" confirms Anne Delleur. And retailers that have to handle all kinds of cosmetics cannot be experts in all areas. ""We have this expertise, and the fact that we develop our own brand is a real asset because we have a real knowledge of markets and of the operational reality. We will not recreate Arcancil under another name, but offer our expertise for the development of specific lines, adapted to local market needs.” Institut Caméane also plans to draw on the expertise gained in ethnic makeup lines including the specific developments for certain skin tones, as well as on its knowledge of makeup habits around the world. Indeed, in the context of its strategy to boost Arcancil on international markets, Institut Caméane continuously grew a very good knowledge regarding the particularities of each market. This led to the development, for darker skin types, of mattifying foundations formulated with specific rates of pigments, or alternatively, of liquid foundations and powders in pinky shades adapted to carnations of a market as Kuwait, or even ultra-pigmented eyeshadows for the Brazilian market. Institut Caméane more specifically targets retailers with 100 to 500 outlets. The first contract has been signed for a launch scheduled for late 2013 / early 2014 and the company aims to develop about ten lines in the next five years. Ultimately, this may require acquiring manufacturing or filling industrial facilities."
Topline opens a subsidiary in Brazil,"A press conference organised on June 8th in the new offices of Topline Products-Primapack in the business district of Paris-La Defense which was the opportunity for Charles Chang, CEO, to outline the key points of his strategy before the entire French team of the Group. ""Topline Products, he recalled, designs and delivers standard and custom-made packagings, for make-up, personal care, perfumes products and turnkey solutions that include formulation and filling. This unique expertise in full service is made possible with the management of factories directly owned by our Asian network of industry partners whose specialties encompass the full array of needs of stakeholders in the beauty sector. But in addition to manufacturing, we focus on designing, and each year we develop innovative features and designs. To date we own more than forty patents."" To note in this regard, one of the latest developments launched in the U.S.: a new two-in-one eyeshadow, Ultimate Performance Brightening for Mally Beauty, the brand of Mally Roncal, a make-up Artist of celebrities. ""First step, we were explained at Topline, the colour base is applied with the foam applicator in order to apply the right quantity of formula. Ultra comfortable, the formula glides to moisturise, smooth and unify the eyelids. Second step, with the use of the tipped roll-on, the light powder settles gently without overloading eyelids. Both formulas unite perfectly to illuminate the look and create an intense and long lasting result.” As for the packaging of this duo eyeshadow it takes up the green pearl lacquering, dear to the American brand. The content of the coloured base was injected as clear as possible to enhance the colour and allow the consumer to select her shade. Finally, the fibres of the foam applicator were selected to enable the most comfortable application possible. ""Innovation is really our vocation and driver,"" stressed Chang. ""Manufacture... anyone can manufacture! But innovating is a different story! And I can tell you that we are currently working on a really innovative new lipstick tube concept which will also meet new environmental requirements. We don’t just manufacture according to the specifications provided by the customer. Our integrated teams in marketing and formulation can play a part upstream in the range creation, be a source of proposals or advise clients on trends, the choice of formulations and on the industrial feasibility of their projects."" Second important point for Topline’s leader, social responsibility. ""Nothing is possible in our business without adequate training,"" insisted Chang.  ""That’s why, as you know, I’ve decided to get involved in the development of Packaging Engineering at the Rutgers University with the creation of an Advisory Board consisting of leaders and policy makers with a business or industry experience, or with government functions or in the education area, and who can provide us with help and advice."" Spearhead in the U.S. group strategy, its full service activity, which currently represents 35% of sales but is expected to reach 50% very quickly. For example, today, according to customer needs and formulas, Topline Products adapts its model and can either send an European or U.S. formula to China to only undertake the packaging, or propose a turnkey product made in China (formula , primary packaging, secondary packaging) or send the European formula to Mexico to have it conditioned in some Chinese or U.S. packagings and thus be the closest as possible to the U.S. and South American markets. Hence, a comprehensive service, since the Group is capable of delivering a complete packaging - including the instructions for use - ready to be lined on the shelves! Founded in 2002, Primapack designs and develops primary, specific or standard packagings in the field of personal care, make-up and perfume. A specialist in plastic and metal injection, multi-material, decoration and various surface treatments, forming, galvanizing and electroplating, the firm manufactures packaging for most major brands in the beauty and skincare segment. ""This acquisition was perfectly in line with our strategic goals, explained Chang, which are to provide very high quality products and services at a local scale and streamline the production line, while increasing our market responsiveness.” ""For us, this merger had huge advantages, underlined Jean-Luc Haulet, the General Manager of Topline-Primapack. Since our inception we were only involved in trading activities, and we now have become real industrialists with a significant size and an unquestionable legitimacy. Our company is strengthening its technical expertise - a technical office both in Paris and in the U.S. - and its ability to innovate thanks to dedicated resources. Another plus: we now offer a full-service expertise."""
L’Oréal Brasil: a winning strategy for make-up!,"Premium Beauty News - You do confirm this fact! Brazil is about to become one of the make-up markets among the largest in the world! Vivian Steinhäuser - Not only do I confirm this, but I can tell you that it’s already true in many segments. This is a sure fact for nail polish. Just look at the performance posted by our brand Colorama that we bought in 2001. All other segments are also growing, apart from, paradoxically, lipstick that remains an important segment but which has been suffering, in recent months, of the dynamism of the others segments, that grows a lot. Premium Beauty News - A specific market, that of the Brazilian market of Beauty! Vivian Steinhäuser - Quite specific, indeed! Since most of the sales occur through door to door selling, a niche where we are not present. Fortunately all the other distribution channels are changing fast. There are about 7000 chains and more than 53,000 independents. A network that we have decided to invest systematically for the past two years and this, successfully! There is also the power of communication that the internet represents nowadays. You have no idea of the number of bloggers who express themselves, on nail polish for example. And Maybelline has now, in Brazil, more than 300,000 ""fans"" in Facebook its pages. A commercial and communication strategy that would not have been possible if we hadn’t undertaken substantial work on our brands and by giving and continuing to give a voice to women. It must be said that in the past fifteen years, ""they"" have changed quit a lot. ""They"" have become more mature, just like, incidentally the distribution networks. We also see more and more openings of malls with all the opportunities it offers for creating temporary poles of attraction. Premium Beauty News - Commercial successes which should therefore lead to industrial investments because, for now, most of your products are imported? Vivian Steinhäuser - Of course, this opens interesting perspectives but it is too early to talk about them. Our two plants, one of them located in Sao Paulo, and the other one in Rio de Janeiro, mostly manufacture products for the skin-care, hair-care and nail markets. We have doubled in two years the sales volume of the Maybelline branded products. The potential is there. Roughly, 85 million Brazilian women use make-up products every day and they use them more and more! They are better informed and have higher incomes."
The BeautyFull Club renews its team,"There are a total of three new faces that join the new managing team following the Club’s General Assembly, which was held on 12 June:  Valérie Jacob, as the new President, Yann Lefrancq-Béjina as Secretary General and Jean-Yves Bourgeois as Vice-President. They succeeded respectively to Charles-Emmanuel Gounod, François Camilli and Daniel Saclier who remain members of the Club. Are renewed in the board, Philippe de Brugière, Vice-President, and Gérard Perrin, Treasurer. Valérie Jacob, the new President of the BeautyFull Club, is the International Marketing Director of the Perfumery & Cosmetics Division of the SGD group, a world leader in the manufacturing of glass bottles for the Perfumery & Cosmetic industry. She is also a director of the Fragrance Foundation and a member of CEW France. Valérie Jacob has been a member of the BeautyFull Club since its foundation. ""I have understood its functioning and development potential,"" she wished to underline. ""I am delighted to join the board and share with others members our experiences and insights of the beauty industry, to better anticipate its future."" Yann Lefrancq, the new Secretary General, has been heading the French subsidiary of German glassmaker Heinz Glas since 2007. As for Jean-Yves Bourgeois, he is currently one of the managers of the Beauteam company, which publishes the PremiumBeautyNews.com website and organizes  the trade shows MakeUp in Paris, MakeUp in New York and, soon, of MakeUp in Sao Paulo. He is also one of the co-founders of the BeautyFull Club. The members of the BeautyFull Club have unanimously commended the four-year presidency of Charles-Emmanuel Gounod, during which most of the association’s objectives were met. ""I was delighted to have contributed to the creation of this club initiated by Jean-Yves Bourgeois. These were four years of great satisfaction during which we had to indeed overcome some obstacles but where the passion of members never failed. Our almost monthly appointments have never ceased to attract a growing number people thanks to the quality of speakers and debates. The latest initiatives in this area, for which several members, including Philippe de Brugière and William Hitchon are attributable, enabled us to benefit from the assistance of grandes écoles and turned out being real successes. Of course, much remains to be done, but I’m convinced the new team has all the required qualities to take up the torch,"" declared Charles-Emmanuel Gounod this week. He will remain an active member of the Club. An equivalent tribute was made to Francis Camilli who contributed greatly, as Secretary General, not only to ""keep the keys of the temple"" as he liked to say, but also to the reputation of the Club through his enthusiasm and interpersonal skills. ""And many thanks to Daniel Saclier, who of course remains an active member of the Club and who has actively contributed to its reputation within the world of brands and was instrumental in setting up the website,"" emphasised Jean-Yves Bourgeois. Many projects and ideas are already in the pipeline: intensify with the grandes écoles the partnership and sponsoring actions, provide always more ""food for thoughts"" through news conferences and new surveys, intensify communication, thanks to, among other things, the website, initiate an offensive recruitment strategy, build bridging relationships with other professional groups by increasing synergies, create a great annual event that would bring together the entire profession, internationalize the activities as much as possible... There is no shortage of ideas."

Stila is a professional make-up artistry brand that delivers prestige, high quality, performance based products to professional makeup artists, consumers, and celebrities. Stila is also known for innovative packaging. The Stila Brand positioning describes Stila as ""a carefree cosmetics brand that is as fun as a fantasy, as individual as a signature, and as inspiring as a dream.  Every day is a new day to put your best face forward.  You are now your own artist. Celebrate your individual style."" Premium Beauty News - You are a very creative person and obviously you are never short of new ideas? Jill Tomandl -  I love coming up with new ideas for products, packaging or innovative programs!  I feel so fortunate to be able to make an impact at a company that values creativity and innovation. We launch new core line products, limited collections and exclusive items seasonally (spring, summer, fall, and holiday.) Examples of promotional collections launched by Stila include Stila for E! Live from the Red Carpet tm Collection, Barbie loves Stila Collection, Breast Cancer Awareness Palettes, several movie partnership and fashion collaborations. Premium Beauty News - The latest novelty to date in terms of packaging is the first solar powered, light up compact that is fully rechargeable that you just launched some weeks ago. Jill Tomandl -  Yes, this is the first ever compact with a solar panel on the lid. When opened, LED’s illuminate the reversed out Stila logo on the lid and the lights around the internal mirror allowing clear visibility for application in any lighting conditions. The compact is supplied by HCP.  The compact comes filled with a duo of translucent and shimmer pressed powder that give skin a healthy, shine free, radiance for any red or green carpet appearance.  The compact can be refilled with Illuminating Powder Foundation. The glass, solar cell panel has a five-year lifespan and is fully charged in nine hours of sunlight.  The green star on the cover indicates the compact is charged. The glass solar panel is protected by a clear cling with 2 passes of silkscreen including the E! Live from the Red Carpet TM logo. Premium Beauty News - Can you give us more examples of this creativity? Jill Tomandl - The first time Stila offered a blockbuster eye shadow palette, it had to be innovative. In order to make the palette unique, I designed a compact inspired by the Color Wheel with the eye shadows positioned, so it is easy for customer to understand how to combine colors and apply each look.  Blockbuster palettes are often overwhelming with too many shades and consumers tend to use only the neutral, wearable shades. There is a Dream Catcher inspired blockbuster palette and a new version launching for Holiday 12. The custom tooled eye shadow pans and compacts create a visually impactful design through the clear window, allowing the shades to be visible in an open sell, retail environment. There is an instructional lookbook and App for each palette to further assist customers in completing the looks. It is a Stila tradition to include a motivational quote inside the eye shadow compact, so it was printed on the dust cover."
Ziba Beauty: pushing the limits of make-up!,"Premium Beauty News - Your commitment, both personal and professional, goes well beyond the mere creation and management of a company specializing in the beauty industry. Sumita Batra - As a family business, it is very much our passion and indeed goes well beyond the basics of business development! Kundan Sabarwal, Suman Patel and myself, have our eyes on the future and are poised to grow Ziba Beauty in two primary areas : First, store expansion. It means that, with a keen eye towards the national scene, we lead hundreds of employees and are rapidly expanding the Ziba Beauty brand presence in California. Second, based on the increasing demand for The Art of Threading®, we have developed a plan that allows a unique specialized art form to grow our locations by constantly bringing new clients into our studio’s, as well as a strong, loyal repeat client base. In addition to the core management team, we have an enviable list of industry experts in the areas of branding, retail design and real estate. Premium Beauty News - What is The Art of Threading® exactly? Sumita Batra - The Art of Threading® is a non-invasive hair removal technique used primarily for eyebrow shaping. A piece of cotton thread is twisted and run along the skin to grab and remove hair from the follicle. This type of hair removal is prevalent in all parts of Asia, and is a common method used to remove unwanted facial hair. Compared to waxing, one does not have to wait for the hair to be a certain length to be removed.  When using The Art of Threading®, a Ziba Artist can remove a single hair or even an entire line of hair in one quick twist. This allows for the brow to be precisely defined and customized to suit each individual. Since the face is the most sensitive area of the body, The Art of Threading® is the ideal application for hair removal. The swift movement of thread by a Ziba Artist also exfoliates dead skin. Fans of threading attest that the service does not cause any rashes or skin irritations common with other hair removal techniques. Regular threading can maintain a clean and sharp appearance of eyebrows without the usual side effects of waxing and shaving. Premium Beauty News - You also have another specialty which has greatly contributed to your reputation too. The one you call The Art of Mehndi® which also extends to The Art of Glitter Mehndi®. A few explanations for the layman... Sumita Batra - The mehndi is a temporary popular form of tattoo, used in various Muslim Arab countries and in Asia. It is often designed, according to ethnic models of varying complexity, especially on the hands and feet, because the skin is thicker in these areas and because of a desire to increase the hold of the colouration over time. In Bangladesh, Kashmir and Sudan, this form of body art is used for weddings for both newlyweds. In Rajasthan (northwestern India), the mehndi is a folk art, and it is common for women to perform designs on them just as refined as those of newlyweds. The preparation of the henna paste is made by grinding the dried leaves of henna to obtain a powder. According to traditions, the powder is mixed with water or a darker liquid such as tea or coffee to darken the colour. Lemon juice can also be added (to release the dye) and sugar (for consistency). The resulting paste is applied, often in very fine drawings (using a small pouch or even a syringe). The contact time with skin having an influence on the hold, the paste is often left on the skin for up to 6 hours before being removed. To increase the drying process of the residue, hands are not washed for several hours. The tattoo can stay as long as a few days up to two weeks depending on the drying time but also the nature of the skin (perspiration or heat promotes discolouration), red-brown colours naturally change to orange before disappearing. Henna mehndi is temporary on the surface of the skin while the tattoo is a permanent and surgical insertion of a dye under the skin. Premium Beauty News - The Art of Glitter Mehndi is an even more sophisticated form with the addition of real jewels on the skin? Sumita Batra - Yes, that’s right! Glitter Mehndi can be enhanced with  Crystals and other sparkling jewels to create spectacular body art. It started as a new form of accessory for brides, and has now become the most sought after service for special occasions at Ziba Beauty. Premium Beauty News - You also created your own Academy? Sumita Batra - We invest heavily in education and training for our technicians and we have developed a program called the Ziba Way®. The artists are certified through the Ziba Academy in a paid training program, with a focus on the study of facial structures and eyebrow shapes to suit different faces. Ziba Artists must follow stringent guidelines to become a threader. The rapid growth at the stores has created opportunities for students to learn from the Ziba Academy and to build lucrative careers. Premium Beauty News - You also designed and developed your own brand of products including a line of make-up products. Sumita Batra - Yes, and we currently achieve about two million dollars in sales in this niche. This line is a ""must have""  collection of contrast pencils, brow tools and body art. This line is sold at Ziba Beauty locations and is becoming a brand extension into the retail market. Premium Beauty News - Your vision of development is not confined to the U.S. market alone. What about Europe? Sumita Batra - We are interested in global expansion, and have developed a strategy that would allow us to grow smartly in key areas around the world, Europe being one of our geographical interests.  Our plan it to expand in the US, then roll out to international markets with presence, leveraging our expertise and elevating the experience of clients all over the world when it comes to our services and products."
Topline-Primapack: A year more than ever dedicated to make-up!,"“First step”, explains Sophie Gaspin, Sales Account Manager at Topline-Primapack, “you apply the coloured base with the foam applicator which enables to apply just the right amount of formula. Ultra comfortable, the formula glides to moisturise, smooth and unify the eyelid. Second step, the reviving effect, the brightening powder settles gently without overloading the eyelid with the roll-on tip. Both formulas unite perfectly to illuminate the look and create an intense and long lasting result. On top of it, our packaging combines technicality and simplicity for a flawless make-up, and whose format is ideal for women on the go."" It may be recalled that Topline Products designs and provides standard and specific packagings, make-up, skincare, fragrances and turnkey solutions that include the formulation and filling.  An expertise in full service made possible through the management of its own factories and through its Asian network of industry partners whose specialties encompass the full range of requirements of actors in the beauty industry. Among other recent achievements of Topline-Primapack, let’s mention the first collection of Swarovski lipsticks ""Crystallize Your Lips"" launched a few weeks ago. ""Long, slim and extremely pure, emphasizes Sophie Gaspin, the design of this lipstick had to be in perfect harmony with the bottle of the perfume Aura by Swarovski.""  The casing is characterised by its small diameter (1.3) for a perfect and precise application.  “It is this originality that dictated the design of the mechanism, we were told at Topline-Primapack, for which we started from scratch and which is in fact more like the mechanism of a stick than that of a lipstick."" A design work that finally lasted nearly a year and a half. In addition to the specificity of this mechanism, it is a complex object. Indeed, the cap consists of two parts, a slick topper in bright silver anodized aluminium in  which is inserted a piece of injected zamac, galvanized in the same shade, whose crimping required a manual adjustment. Injection enabled to created the ideal form to receive the precious contents, whose binding, positioning and sinking, manually adjusted, are worthy of jewellery work. As a result: a perfect incrustation of the stone! Also particularly studied: the subtle shade of the screen printing on the casing, the frank click sound upon closure, or the easy handling of the mechanism. With a creamy and light texture, Crystallize Your Lips is enriched with a Swarovski micronized crystal powder of iridescent pearls Crystal Shine. The grape is adorned with a imprint reminiscent of crystal facets and reveals a powdery floral scent."
Thibiant International: the American beauty!,"The ""Thibiant"" is a family first of all! In 1970, Aida Thibiant and her husband, Michel, decide to leave France to settle on the West Coast of the United States. A fresh start from scratch, him with a background in buildings and construction, her with her degree as a beautician. Aida Thibiant quickly finds a job in a hair salon. She is talented and has a lot of interpersonal skills. She soon attracts the sympathy and friendship of many personalities, especially from Showbiz. In 1973, Aida Thibiant opens her own beauty salon in Los Angeles, in the city’s most mythical area, Beverly Hills, by offering in the beginning, the full range of products from the French brand Guinot. The development is such that in 1976 the father and the son, Patrick, in turn get fully involved in the business which takes the name of Francosmétique.  They take this opportunity to recover the rights to sell the Guinot products throughout the United States but also start developing their own products under the brand Thibiant Beverly Hills. ""My mother and myself had very specific ideas about the kind of cosmetics we wanted to develop,"" explains Patrick Thibiant. Ideas that focused more specifically ""naturalness"". A first generation of these products appear on the market in the first months of 1980. And it’s a complete success! Some more lines see the light, and in 1988, it’s a further boost... through direct selling on television. ""At the time, emphasizes Patrick Thibiant, we thought with my mother...why not have a go at it!"" Especially since the use of this new marketing method suits the development of a new generation of products. Within months, sales explode! ""With television, we achieve up to US$50 million in retail sales each year,"" details Patrick Thibiant.  “We had to develop the business and give ourselves the necessary industrial means.” Especially since the good reputation of the Thibiants in the formulation area generated in parallel some requests from large cosmetics brands to perform some subcontracting. In 1990, the first contract is signed with Bath and Body Works. From this date on, the future of Thibiant International will be increasingly associated with subcontracting. In 1995 the company employs 60 people and has a turnover of USD 15 millions. That same year the family business settles in its first building in an industrial area of Chatsworth. Three years later, the decision it taken to acquire a second building, then a third one in 2001. Today, Thibiant International comprises no less than five buildings with a total area of almost 330,000 sq ft (31 000 m²). Meanwhile, in 2008, the mythical brand Thibiant Beverly Hills who helped put the group on tracks is sold. Patrick Thibiant who has been holding the reins of the company for the past ten years focuses his strategy around a strong concept which is summarized in six words: ""Innovation, Personal Care, Development and Manufacturing.""  Masks, creams, products for acne, shampoos, foundations... the range is huge.  ""Above all, we are formula creators,"" insists Patrick Thibiant, proud of his laboratory at the cutting edge in terms of equipments and which has 25 full time employees. New formulas but new presentations too. ""We are the ones behind the new patented filling system, explains Patrick Thibiant, which make possible the conditioning of different formulas which only mix together at the time of use.""  And in addition, you can see it happen from the outside! A filling technique that enables to achieve amazing geometric effects with the different layers of products. ""It took ten years of development!"" points out Patrick Thibiant. And the future? ""It can only be tonic for us,"" says Patrick Thibiant. ""Subcontracting is a fundamental trend in the U.S., which is not ready to disappear. And some other cosmetic sectors are within our reach and just waiting to grow."""
Make-up subcontracting in the U.S.: the consistent business card of The Color Factory,"Premium Beauty News - How do you stand today in the industrial spectrum of the U.S. Beauty sector? Kathryn Geller - What can, in my opinion, best express our positioning is summed up in a few key words: ""Production capacity, flexibility, responsiveness, research and development."" The Color Factory is a complete cosmetic & skincare development and manufacturing company. We stand as the west coast leaser in all phases of contract manufacturing. Our manufacturing capabilities enable us to provide a full line of cosmetic & skincare products for lips (natural & organic, silicone mould lip stick, lip gloss, lip pencil, lip powder), for the face (pressed face powder, loose face powder, mineral and organic powder, cream and mineral foundation, tinted moisturizer, concealer), cheeks (pressed, loose blush, cream and bronzer), eyes (loose, pressed and cream eye shadow, eye liner, eye pencil, mascara), skin care (anti-aging, oil control, mineral, natural, organic, SPF), bath & bodies (cleanser, scrub, moisturizer, cellulite), and, last but not least, special categories like baked or multi-colored powders, over-sprayed design, custom hot pour, and also fragrances (liquid and solid perfume). Premium Beauty News - Impressive and comprehensive range indeed! Now, can you provide us with some figures on your production capacity? Kathryn Geller - Well I can tell you for example that we can produce about 140,000 lipsticks per week (two shifts). Our total filling capacity for tubes per week per shift is 100,000 pieces. A figure that reaches 140,000 pcs per shift for the filling of liquid lotions, and 50,000 pcs for creams. The powder area where we are certainly among the best performers in the U.S. accounts alone for nearly 50% of our business. We also have nine Dosa Pack Powder Presses with various tooling (capacity on single color, 10 000 pcs per shift; capacity on duo, trio and quads, 5000 pcs per shift), and on the other hand, one fully automatic filling line 2 X twin head Auger fillers (capacity, 15 000 pcs per shift, Auto Plus Insertion, Auto Cap Placement and Tighten, Auto Shrink band application, Auto base label application, video ink jet and laser coding). Not to mention one off single head Auger Filler (capacity, 10,000 pcs per shift). Regarding mascara and lip gloss, we can produce some 50,000 pcs per day (single shift). I must say that we have always wanted to have the ultimate in production lines. Premium Beauty News - Quality is obviously essential! Kathryn Geller - Essential of course! We work with Customers to define their quality expectations, and then we manufacture products that exceed their expectations. The Color Factory does this by qualifying all manufacturing processes with which these expectations can be met. We also verify that each defined characteristics they desire is provided through careful monitoring. We check all raw materials and components to make sure they meet the physical properties required, and to ensure they are free of all microbiological contaminants prior to use. Completed formulas are tested and color matched to the specifications of the Customer. The manufacturing process allows for the Customer to give formula approval prior to filling. The production processes are monitored very closely by production and quality employees. Upon completion, the finished products are evaluated to ensure they exceed the Customer’s expectations. Premium Beauty News - You rather prefer working on large volume or do you accept smaller orders? Kathryn Geller - Our manufacturing equipment is too large to accept small orders, however from time to time we break that rule.  When someone comes to us with an idea that we believe in, we go to any lengths to help them.  Sometimes they turn out to be next year’s large account. That being said, the minimum quantity we accept is of the order of 5,000 per shade, but it is true that the company’s strategy is more focused on key accounts. We can say that we are now mostly working with ten major groups from the US Beauty sector. Premium Beauty News - Do you operate more on the mass-market segment or the upper-end one? Kathryn Geller - We have very good clients in each sector.  We concentrate on the client’s needs, not where their products are sold. Clearly, rather more on the upper-end one. At least, we are recognized as such! Every twelve weeks, we present our customers a whole range of new products thanks to the seven people who work exclusively in the product development service. Premium Beauty News - Being a major subcontractor in the US cosmetic sector, you are at the heart of trends. Precisely, what are they? Kathryn Geller - The biggest trend we see is multiple use products. Consumers are savvier than ever and products that are a great value or eye catching and new do really well. We have noticed a very sharp come back, not to say a real enthusiasm for lipstick at the expense of traditional lip gloss. Powder remains a flagship product with the desire to offer diverse and varied palettes. Premium Beauty News - You are mostly working today for the U.S. domestic market.... what are your plans for tomorrow? Kathryn Geller - We are developing new technologies in manufacturing and products not currently on the market that will appeal to the global high end market.  Yes, we are mostly focused on the US market. However, the majority of the brands that we manufacture for distribute their products globally."
Brazil: Naturelle is surfing the wave of full service,"Premium Beauty News - Your brand ""Natuflora"", does still exist? Levi Kann - Absolutely! But it is true that as the years went by, the business model of our company totally changed. Today 95% of our business consists in designing, manufacturing and packaging formulas for our customers. Perfumes represent half of our activity followed mainly by Skin Care (20%) and Hair Care (15%). We also do a little lip gloss. Premium Beauty News - Your installation three years ago, in this brand new factory where you are operating today represented a major turning point? Levi Kann - Yes, indeed it marked a turning point for the company! We simply doubled our production and our staff which currently consists of 110 people today. The investment was considerable for us and the cultural change too. Being at first a small family business, this was quite a leap. Premium Beauty News - This must have resulted in a change in your customer base? Levi Kann - No, not really. Our customer base consists mostly of many brands, rather more ""fashion"" focused, and which operate in both midrange and upper range segments. Our main asset lies in the flexibility that we had and that we have wanted to keep. We can manufacture and package many different products and in both small, medium and large quantities. I am used to saying that the minimum can even consist of ""one"" sample! Premium Beauty News - You offer a total full service! Levi Kann - Exactly! Regarding the type of packaging we often provide our advice on the matter but we don’t have, strictly speaking, any standard ranges to offer. We buy what the customer wants. In general closures and plastic finishings come from Brazil, pumps outside Brazil. Bottles mainly from Brazil. Premium Beauty News - Development prospects are good, of course! Levi Kann - Rather good, it’s true! Especially since the evolution of the Brazilian legislation on taxes, in the past four years has tended to favour full service activities like ours. As often in Brazil, the ""taxes"" issue is probably one of the most complicated and the most worrying of all. Without going into details, it has become more interesting to outsource manufacturing and packaging activities than do them yourself..."
Weckerle do Brasil: A trailblazer!,"Premium Beauty News - The least we can say, is that Brazil is a country you know! Thomas Weckerle - Yes, we know it, but believe me it was not an easy matter, far from it in the mid-1990s to start a business, if only a commercial one in this region. By the early 2000s, we had to face the facts. To be sustainably present, it was necessary to produce locally. Hence the decision to build a first production unit of 5000 sq ft. Obviously, it was the right choice! Because very quickly, we reached saturation. Demand was high. In 2003, we took the decision to build a second plant, then seven years later, we moved in a new factory 80 kilometres from Sao Paulo. Fernando Diamint - Today Weckerle do Brasil Ltda employs approximately 380 people on these two sites and produces some 40 million units per year. We can do almost everything in terms of full-service for make-up, from formulation through plastic injection including conditioning. We produce pencils, lipstick tubes, lip gloss, eyeliners, mascaras, compacts, etc. Premium Beauty News - Mostly for the Brazilian domestic market? Thomas Weckerle - At 95%, yes! We supply nearly one hundred local brands and growth rates are around 15% a year. Premium Beauty News - What are your growth prospects for the coming months? Thomas Weckerle - We are extending our product portfolio to skin care to win new customers and serve our existing customers even better. With this wide range of products and the fact, that we are producing everything in Brazil, I think we can participate even more in such a growing market."
Capsum strengthens its expansion with a new partnership,"After concluding two months ago, a first partnership with Genealogy on the US market and jointly launching their first collection RevOlution™, the French start-up specialized in product design has now partnered with Sudcosmetics. This SME based in the south of France, which was taken over by Laurent Dodet last June, is known for its services offer in formulation, regulations, manufacturing and packaging of conventional and natural cosmetics. ""When I took over the company in June 2011, one of my goals was to make of Sudcosmetics a subcontractor, a source of proposals surfing on innovation. Our partnership with Capsum will give us this opportunity. We will use their innovations in product design to develop specific applications,"" says Laurent Dodet. For its part, as emphasised Sébastien Bardon its CEO, Capsum can fully focus on their expertise. ""Sudcosmetics has an industrial expertise which is very complementary to ours. They know perfectly how to industrialize and condition emulsions, serums, specific products associated to objects (including cosmetic pearls) that we create"". Indeed, Sudcosmetics operates with both a manufacturing capacity of 2,500 tons per year and a packaging capacity of 30 million pieces per year. A team of 40 people including 3 exclusively dedicated to research and development makes up their work force. But the partnership does not stop there and by listening to the two leaders one understands very well that a willingness to co-create is present on both sides. ""We are located close to one another, both companies having their offices in the Marseille area, we are young, we cultivate a dynamics which is specific to start-ups, teamwork and co-creation are thinks we take for granted"" add Bardon and Dodet . This also enables to save money in terms of development and commercial presence, an interesting fact regardless of times."
Arcancil is getting its colours back,"Since it has made its come back on the marketplace at the end of 2007, Arcancil is definitely getting its colours back. After a quick succession of store openings on every continent, the brand is now present in 25 countries and continues to expand its sales networks, with always the desire to outperform in the eye category, its historical strong point. In Brazil, Arcancil which was already present in Sao Paulo, Manaus and Recife with Calèche and other selective perfumeries, will enter Shampoo boutiques in Rio de Janeiro. The same logic of expansion applies for Morocco, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, where gradually Arcancil is increasing the store openings. To support sales growth, and approach its customers again, the brand has just completed its first commercial for its mascara, Cil Cabaret, its flagship line. ""Our goal is to double in three years time our export turnover,"" announced Anne Delleur. With a 28% increase the previous year, and a 36% growth for the current year, the company is well on track to achieve its goal. Arcancil relies in particular on its strong reputation in Eastern Europe and its first successes in this area should enable the company to relocate in Russia, a country which was historically one of its key markets. As for France, in May, the end of the exclusivity binding the brand to the Galeries Lafayette should open up new opportunities for development. To face these new challenges, the brand has reinforced itself with in particular, the arrival in January 2012 of Véronique Biolley who was appointed Marketing Director. A graduate of ESSEC, she spent more than four years in L’Oréal’s Consumer Products division, as Head of styling products and then of make-up products for L’Oréal Paris and as group leader for Gemey Maybelline. She then left for the United States, where she worked for Bonpoint the children’s clothing brand. Back in France, she joined the Arc International Group in 2005. ""At 36, Veronica has more than one string to her bow,"" explains Delleur. ""The combination of her expertise in make-up product Development, combining technicality and aesthetic sense, and her knowledge of Retail issues will be a major asset in the development strategy of the Arcancil brand in France and abroad."" Indeed, the brand must now demonstrate its ability to grow while maintaining the creative inspiration and high quality standards that gave the company its new breath of life. ""Arcancil Paris wants to continue to embody what it is intrinsically, a true historical know-how, in particular in eye make-up, a brand at the forefront of innovation and trends, accessible to the greatest number of people in France and abroad,"" insisted Delleur. But the great event of the year 2012 for the brand , is the signing of the make-up artist Morgane Hilgers, who, as the international spokesperson of the brand, created the make-up of the video Cil Cabaret and who will take a part in all the advertising operations of the brand, for which she also plays a role of creative stimulus. She is in particular, behind the development of a range of smart brushes for smoky eyes effects. Five years after a successful recovery, this concentration of new talents should enable the brand continue its steady pace and establish its new modern and glamour brand image."
Hourglass carries on its international expansion,"Premium Beauty News - You created your company in 2004, you were just 30. What were your motivations to embark on such an adventure? Carisa Janes - After attending the Parsons School of Design, I started working for the Urban Decay brand and on the launch of their range of products for Generation X, which has since become iconic. In 1997, I created for Body & Soul their line of cosmetics inspired from the 40s and their Hollywood stars and then I founded ISA Design LLC, a consulting firm to support the launch of brands particularly niche brands. Quite logically this led me to the creation of my own company, Hourglass. Premium Beauty News - On what concept did you create Hourglass? Carisa Janes - On ""modern luxury"" and femininity. I wanted elegant, functional products and whose formulas would be tailored to the needs of most demanding skins. Where we are able, We make no use of parabens, phthalates, or perfumes. All our products for the skin complexion contain such anti-aging actives as hyaluronic acid, peptides, plant stem cells vitamins... Moreover, we pay special attention to packaging, its practicality and design. We work in partnership with component manufacturers like HCT Packaging with whom we have developed our lip gloss, Prodigy, with its ergonomic shape or our Lash Lacquer, Film Noir, with its paint-brush applicator. Our eye and face powders are contained in cases fitted with rotating mirrors thus providing an additional comfort of use. Premium Beauty News - Since the creation of Hourglass, what has been its growth like? Carisa Janes - The brand was launched exclusively in 2004 at Barney’s in New York. We had an offering of 50 products mainly lipsticks and glosses, foundations, powders and make-up palettes. Distribution remained very selective until 2007 when we entered Sephora and Sephora.com. From 17 stores at the beginning, our presence has skyrocketed since we are now present in  328 stores in the United States (Sephora and other retailers) but also in Canada, England, Germany, Singapore, Mexico , Australia and New Zealand and our range consists of 150 products. We now consist of a team of 30 people. Premium Beauty News - Who are your main competitors? Carisa Janes - Our competitors are such luxury brands as Yves Saint Laurent, Armani, Dior and Laura Mercier. We are positioned in upscale price ranges with our lipstick which is sold at around US$ 30, and US$ 65 for the serum. Our sales are mostly performed in Sephora stores but also increasingly on the internet. Premium Beauty News - What are your expansion plans for the future? What about France? Carisa Janes - We intend to establish ourselves in Brazil and to continue to expand and maintain our values hinged on ""modern luxury"" and femininity. The French market is attracting but we don’t have any specific plans in the short term."
Stölzle-Oberglas is gaining momentum,"An Parisian inauguration that was occurring just several weeks after the official launch of the new 200 tons/day furnace and of a new coating line in the Polish plant in Czestochowa. In two years time, leaders of the group will have invested a total of 150 million euros of which 45 million euros in Poland but also in their English glass factory in Knottingley (West Yorkshire) which has a furnace of 120 tons/day dedicated to the perfumes and cosmetic industry. A new lacquering line is being installed too. An industrial offensive that has already resulted in some beautiful creations like the new bottle ""Black Up"" whose originality lies in the 8mm recess on one side of the bottle and on a flat glass distribution. To note also the new home bottles with the Cobalt blue ""Gant"" but also ""Voyager"" and the multi-faceted diamond of the bottle ""Marcel"" from Oriflame... Not to mention the bottles ""Pyramide des sens"" from the Dorin House."
"Hwa Sung, formulas and multi-functions!","The most recent ones, are those from the series Color Brow Tint with Brush end, or the Super Slim Brow pencil, not to mention the Triangular eye brow pencil, the Brow Powder with an NBR Tip and the Color Brow Gel. ""This is a true second nature,"" explains Kim E.H, Vice President Global Sales & Marketing, ""innovation is permanent at Hwa Sung. We never stop asking ourselves again and again the same questions every year, every month, almost every day to continually improve the comfort of use of the products we manufacture for the biggest Korean and global cosmetic brands."" At a rate of five to ten new products a year, customers can not be disappointed. ""But it is not so much at the application level that we innovate,"" emphasises Yumi Kim, Global Sales & Marketing Team Leader, ""but also and mostly in the formulas themselves."" ""Finally we offer a comprehensive solution where the applicator whatever it is, explains Kim E.H, must be in perfect symbiosis with the type of formulas or combination of formulas that we develop.”  And no standards but only and always ""specifics"". Indeed, during a presentation of the range of solutions offered by the Korean company, we are not disappointed. There is something to suit everyone’s taste and mood. Such a brush combined with such formula as components of a multifunction applicator where, with a simple gesture, one can also access a type of powder or blush whose simultaneous application enables multiple effects... Without forgetting lipsticks also integrated in a set that splits into two or three compartments to access, there too, to one or two formulas which, when applied to the lips, make them look very red or very pink darken or glossy, bright or matt. A real festival of solutions that leave the visitor a little speechless. On the industrial side, the Korean company has a new plant since 1998 in the suburbs of Seoul, runs thirty ""home-designed"" filling lines of which 80% are automatic, produces more than one million pieces a month, employs a total of 70 people and will achieve this year a turnover of USD 20 million. After the wooden pencils that the company will abandon completely in the early 2000s, it will specialize in pencils and plastic applicators in the 80s, actually starting its series of ""two and three in one"" in 2004. Today it also offers, - formulas included - make-up cases with multiple compartments and openings, mascaras, lipgloss in a combination or not... Our main strengths, according to Kim E.H, ""besides the quality of our formulas and our ability to innovate, are our flexibility and speed of implementation thanks to our size. It takes from seventy to ninety days maximum between the start of a development and the beginning of the production. Moreover we take orders as of 5,000 pieces."" The key customer markets are Korea, of course, and Asia in general but also the United States and Europe."
The Body Shop awards its suppliers,"Invited suppliers came from across the UK, Europe, Asia and USA to partake in the event, the second of its kind. It was an occasion to strengthen relationships and to share expectations with The Body Shop teams.  “The Supplier Day provided a business update on the strategy outlined in last year’s edition and re-confirmed the direction for the coming years,” explains Jerome Courtaigne, Sourcing Director of The Body Shop. The gathering also allowed to reconfirm the brand’s specificity, in particular in regards to its Ethical and Community Fair Trade programmes and its five Values : Against Animal Testing, Support Community Fair Trade, Activate Self Esteem, Defend Human Rights and Protect Our Planet.  “2012 is a landmark year for The Body Shop to pave the way for a sustainable growth” adds Jerome Courtaigne. Opening the event, Ann Massal, Brand Director, spoke about the achievements and challenges of The Body Shop and her expectations for suppliers to deliver more innovation.  Innovation is one of The Body Shop’s five main key performance indicators (KPIs) for suppliers, along with quality, supply chain, sustainable development and competitiveness. It is one of the most important indicators within The Body Shop’s Convergence sourcing strategy. The Supplier Day is complemented by another annual event, the Innovation Day, which was also started last year and will be organised once again this July. Philippe Reale, Director of Operations, underlined how suppliers directly contribute to the performance of Operations through excellence on these KPIs, something that The Body Shop sees as the basis for building a robust and sustainable relationship. A much anticipated addition this year was the first supplier awards.  A total of eight awards were given to the following: – Best Overall Finished Good Supplier, LF Beauty,
– Best Overall Packaging Supplier, M&H Plastics, 
– Best NPD Supplier, Fleet Laboratories,
– Best Value Re-engineering and Convergence Supplier, Laleham Healthcare, 
– Best Quality Supplier, Soapworks,
– Best Improved Quality, S&J International Enterprises,
– Best Service Level Supplier, LF Beauty,
– Best Improved Service level, Hampshire Cosmetics. After the ceremony, Frederic Ennabli, CEO of The Body Shop, led a very active Q&A session, delivering many insights on the business strategy and future growth. Christophe Guesnet, Chief Purchasing Officer of L’Oréal Group, touched upon the strategic role of suppliers at The Body Shop. He also highlighted the potential for suppliers who perform well for The Body Shop to have business opportunities into the wider L’Oréal Group. According The Body Shop, the Convergence sourcing strategy, which was initiated in 2011 with the very first Supplier Day, has been delivering results to the business through better volume consolidation by core supplier expertise, value re-engineering on core products, innovation for new product developments and continuous improvement on the five KPI. “The Body Shop wants to reinforce the business relationship with main suppliers with tangible benefits for both parties and to become the preferred customer for the key vendors.  This event is a major milestone to better align The Body Shop and suppliers strategies based on mutual understanding and shared goals,” highlighted Jerome Courtaigne at the end of the event."
Cosmetic subcontracting: Korea wants to export its model more,"A well established industry whose structure and messages - that set the bar very high in terms of quality, sophistication and environmental standards - reflect its importance in the economic system and with regards to the issues at stake in a highly innovation demanding sector. Many Koreans manufacturers have managed to seize this opportunity to create absolute jewels in terms of R & D and manufacturing capabilities. But all of them express the same overall vision in the medium and long term. Faced with Korean and Japanese domestic markets close to saturation, sliders are increasingly switching in the direction of China, and more specifically to sophisticated markets represented by the United States and Europe, in a better position to pay ""Made in Korea"" products. To exemplify this, we took two companies and not the least, the Kolmar Korea and Cosmax companies. Concerning Kolmar Korea, created just over twenty years ago, its scope of activity has continued to grow over the years. So much so that the group headed by Mr. Dong-han Yoon, its founder, can display a consistent business card. With no less than...four production sites, 1,000 employees, a turnover of USD 300 million dollars last year and with 65% of the activity serving the cosmetic sector (with half of it for make-up), 30% for pharmacy and 5% to dietary supplements. A turnover that has literally exploded between 2007 and 2011 with annual growth rates of over 20%; no wonder then that the CEO of the company proudly displays a market share for subcontracting in Korea that he estimated at 38%. When one knows that there are about 400 companies that are assumed to be operating in the same segment in this country of 50 million inhabitants, that’s indeed something to be proud of. Kolmar’s history, since its inception in 1990, is marked by both patent filing (99 in total), by the opening of industrial sites and by the obtaining of all the possibly available certificates of compliance (CGMP in 1994, ISO 9001 in 2001, KGMP in 2002, Ecocert in 2009, ISO 22716 in 2011). As for the manufacturing plants, the two sites specialized in skin care cover an area of nearly 10,000 sqm and offer an annual capacity of 70 million units. Those dedicated to make-up cover more than 6,000 sqm and have a capacity of 60 million units per year for a wide product range (powders, eyeliners, eyeshadows, lipsticks, mascaras etc..). Not to mention the ""pharma"" unit of more than 20,000 sqm (46 million units) and dietary supplements of more than 5,000 sqm (150 million units). The new plant located in Beijing, more dedicated to skin care and body care, which opened last year ""to access the fantastic Chinese market"", according the words of the leaders of Korea Kolmar, covers 7,800 sqm for an annual production capacity of 45 million units. A commissioning which expresses the desire of the firm to export its know-how outside of Korea. Because the Korean domestic market, where Kolmar has been excelling since its creation and which accounts for 90% of its activity, is almost saturated. Hence for Kolmar, it’s time to turn elsewhere, especially to the U.S., Europe and ... South America. The ambitions of the Cosmax company are the same. The business card of the company founded in 1992 is particularly impressive. Over the last five years, its turnover will have recorded a pretty astonishing jump from USD 65 million to 182 million last year! Growth rates of 22%, 31% and even 36% year on year! The company has positioned itself as a total outsourcing company in both the skin care and make-up segment with a 50/50 distribution, which has not changed during this period. Like any Korean company worthy of the name, the R&D is considered strategic enough for the company to have 27% of its employees working there. The company also highlights its ability to create formulas and boasts that 95% of products are manufactured from them. Of course it can also display a full range of conformity certification (CGMP in 1998, ISO 9001 in 2000, OHSAS 18001 in 2007). But also only exports15% of its production, mainly to Japan and Europe. This has to change... The company owns three manufacturing sites in Korea and soon, two factories in China since the second one will be running next September in Guangzhou on 27,000 sqm. An increase in the production tool that should not stop there since officials at Cosmax are already talking of a fifth factory in Asia in 2013... In terms of production lines, the capacity is consistent with 22 lines for skin-care (almost 90,000 units/year), 21 for lipsticks (27,600 units/year), 3 for mascaras (9,200 units/year), 26 for powders (about 44,000 units/year).
Its leaders, KS Lee, Chairman, and CH Song, President, also want to deliver a strong message around what they call ""the spirit of the three apples."" The first, ""Eve’s apple,"" the apple of morality. The second, the ""Apple of Beauty,"" the one which was given to Aphrodite by the Trojan prince. The third, ""Newton’s apple of science"", the one that inspired Newton for the development of his theory of universal gravitation. ""These three symbols hinged on the apple, explain the leaders, reflect exactly our industrial philosophy based on honesty, on our mission to contribute to a life more beautiful and finally on our goal for research and development."" Quit a program indeed!"
Schwan Cosmetics continues to grow,"""The Group’s best results in the company’s history!"" is the statement that ended the fiscal year of the German Schwan STABILO  Group last June. Sales dramatically increased by 66 million euro over the previous year.  ""A great performance across geographies, brands and categories!"" we were told by Barbara Bauer-Kropf, Executive Vice President Sales and Marketing Cosmetics at the company’s headquarters in Heroldsberg, a few miles outside of Nuremberg. An even more interesting result as it came from strong sales of the Cosmetic Division (+ 25%), all product lines included. During times like this, it is almost impossible to keep up with customer requirements without drastically investing. First on the agenda was an increase in production capacity for plastic pencils with the start up of new production lines. One of the main parts of the manufacturing process, the technology for the production of cosmetic bulk also underwent a complete overhaul. A modernization that not only helped increase the production capacity,  but also boosted new formula innovations and impacted the entire environmental process by reducing energy and water usage by over 30%. The third project completed was the successful implementation of SAP. ""A particularly tricky project to implement,” Barbara Bauer-Kropf noted, “since it involved nearly fifty internal and external engineers during a two- year period. But it was worth it! With this new software, already used by over 500 employees, business processes can be run more effectively and productively.” And last but not least, the fourth project, the set up of the new company website which contains more than 200 pictures representing most of the group’s product references. It is an interactive website with many new features that keeps customers easily informed and is even able to create tailor-made presentations for each individual client. The website is already quite a success, as it currently claims some thousands of visitors per month with the number steadily increasing and connections coming from seventy-six different countries."
A new partner for Geka to strengthen international expansion,"Frankfurt-based investor Halder has signed a definitive agreement to sell its majority shareholding in Geka GmbH to 3i.  Halder had acquired Geka in 2007.  Parties involved have agreed not to disclose the financial details of the transaction which is subject to approval of anti-trust authorities. Geka, headquartered in Bechhofen, Germany, serves both the mass market and premium segment for packaging in the cosmetic industry. In addition, it distributes cosmetic accessories via its division Victoria.  Founded in 1925, the company has a broad patent and product portfolio. Geka is a pioneer in innovation of plastic injection moulding for mascara brushes and mascara packaging as well as a development partner of market leading international cosmetics groups including Procter & Gamble, Avon and LVMH. The company runs production facilities in Bechhofen, Germany and in Elgin, Illinois, USA with an additional sales office in France. The packaging manufacturer employs around 650 staff globally and generated revenues of approximately 100 million euros in 2011. “Geka’s future growth will come from its strength in innovation and its international expansion,” said 3i in a release. “The arrival of this new partner can only strengthen the development of Geka in its business, both in Europe and the United States and in new Asian and South American markets, particularly China and Brazil,” explains Franco Lucá, CEO. A development that took the form of noteworthy industrial investments in 2011 and that will continue in 2012. One of the main events last year for Geka, was the start of its filling line in Bechhofen. “This year, confirms Franco Lucá, we are building new facility for ten new injection machines, several finishing machines and four injection moulding machines."" Cost of the operation: 6.8 million euros. A similar program is scheduled in the U.S. plant for US$ 2.1 million. Regarding innovations, Geka, always at the cutting edge, should also launch a lot of new products, especially on its preferred segment: injected brushes.  ""In addition to expanding our business into the Asian and South American markets, we are looking to enter the cosmeceutical market with 3i’s support,"" Lucá adds. ""Geka’s innovative strength and long-term partnerships with the leading cosmetics manufacturers put the company in an excellent position to foster growth in its highly attractive and stable market segment. We are convinced that we can support the company’s expansion and development by providing it access to growth capital and 3i’s international network,"" summarizes Ulf von Haacke, Partner and Managing Director of 3i Germany."
Fiabila: Results for 2011 and an outlook on 2012!,"Premium Beauty News - There has been no signs of a slowdown in your activity these past months and, even more so for the year that just started? Pierre Miasnik - It’s true! Our business this year should be just as strong as it was last year. To summarize, and to better understand the challenges to which we are confronted, Fiabila doubled its turnover in two years time! And it is certainly not finished. Nail polish has become the unavoidable make-up accessory. Each passing day confirms this. Just imagine, of the 160,000 colour references included in our portfolio, over 30,000 were active last year! Premium Beauty News - Such growth obviously requires to be able to follow suit industrially speaking? Pierre Miasnik - Of course! As we had already announced some months ago in your newsletter, we have opened last October a new packaging site of 3,500 sqm in France, in Le Perray en Yvelines that hosts an area for filling operations equipped with high-speed lines but also two storage areas, one for containers, and the other one for flammable raw materials. Aim of the operation: increase our overall capacity, but also a desire to offer our customers the best possible service. As for the U.S., we have just acquired a second plant in New Jersey, which will be operational in May this year. Furthermore, an extension for this site will be completed in January 2013. Two joint actions that will, also, enable us to purely and simply double our business across the Atlantic.
Third country, India where we are currently completing the construction of our second factory (3,500 sqm). It will be operational in late June. Premium Beauty News - 2012 will also be a special year for your plant in Maintenon! Pierre Miasnik - Yes and this is a major project! We have obtained all the necessary authorisations for the site’s extension. The purpose is not only to step up production thanks to an improved productivity, but to also optimize safety conditions by limiting, for example, to the maximum handling in open tanks. Premium Beauty News - Quality and safety...., two obsessions! Pierre Miasnik - They are not the only ones but they are indeed very important! You know, our customers standards have never stopped increasing. Our products have evolved considerably towards greater purity with the use of increasingly safer raw materials for consumers. Our role is of course to provide the product that matches best the desired quality. This results in huge investments not only from an industrial viewpoint but also, in terms of staff. The qualification of our personnel is a constant concern. Especially since in parallel there is a reduction in the number of major global players which means we have to deal with still larger bulk quantities. Highly refined and flawless quality, short deadlines, a wide variety of products, large tonnages, controlled risks... give you an idea of the equation! Premium Beauty News - Your desire to extend to other parts of the world is still one of your goals? Pierre Miasnik - Yes, of course! But it’s still a little too early to talk about it. The 2012 year should hold some surprises."
Capsum and Genealogy join forces,"Premium Beauty News - Before we start talking about your partnership, why not take a snapshot of your two companies created respectively in June 2008 for Genealogy and September 2008 for Capsum, How far have you got more than three years after? Aea Marc - Our company, Genealogy which was created by Brian Fox offers in the fields of make-up and skincare a full service offer of products whose characteristics have always something to do with innovation. We have to date a range of more 200 references and create 3 to 4 collection a year. For each client, the offer is customized to best meet its DNA. This can range from the choice of actives, textures, colours including the use of exclusive raw materials, of customized packaging... Our market consists of many niche brands that are looking for differentiating products and who are hungry for new ideas. Our offers always marry aesthetics and beautiful quality. We are strongly established in the United States but also present in Europe and the United Kingdom. In the past 4 years our annual growth ranged between 30 and 150%. We meet the needs of companies that have a strong expertise in marketing and sales with a good distribution but who do not have in-house resources to design and manufacture their cosmetics. Sébastien Bardon - Since its inception, Capsum focuses on the design of products and in the follow-up of their manufacturing. Our field of expertise is microfluidics, a high scientific value ""object by object"" technology which saw the light at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston and which enables to develop, such materials as beads, emulsions, capsules... The process is very qualitative with perfectly controlled and reproducible drop sizes. We work on objects ranging from 10 nm to just a few millimetres. The field of possibilities is very wide. We are in discussion with all the major global luxury groups and are already working with Amore Pacific in Korea and La Prairie. For the 3 years, our turnover has increased by an average of 30% a year and we have, to date, 22 employees. The partnership signed between Genealogy and Capsum also corresponds to an evolution of our offer because we now propose finished products whereas before we were just involved in tailor-made products. For the record, Capsum was a laureate of the 2009 Oséo competition for the creation of the most innovative company and was awarded the label of Young Innovative Company by the French Ministry of the economy. Premium Beauty News - Could we say that Capsum provides technology while Genealogy provides the cosmetic know-how? Bardon -  It is one aspect of our complementarity, but it is not the only one. Indeed, as Capsum is a scientific company, we offer breakthrough innovations and Geneaolgy knows how to place them in a use context for cosmetics. Genealogy awakens us to market trends. Aea Marc -  We find new technologies and have them match the needs of women. Nowadays, women have developed an awareness to natural ingredients which are soft to their skin, with no chemical material and Capsum’s technology does meet in particular this need by limiting the use of surfactants. We make ours innovation, and change it into a cosmetic product. Sébastien Bardon and Aea Marc - We also have a market complementarity, Capsum works with larger luxury groups and Genealogy is very experienced in developing contracts with smaller brands. In addition, our geographic areas are complementary. Capsum is present in Asia and France, and Genealogy in the United States and the UK. Premium Beauty News - How did this partnership start in the first place? Sébastien Bardon and Aea Marc - It all started with a meeting between Brian Fox and Sébastien Bardon which resulted in a common desire for co-creation as part of the product development but not only since we have pooled our forces for the prospecting of customers through a give and take and a joint presence on the trade shows. The teams have in addition also respectively made long stays in both companies to impregnate themselves with the cultures which are very compatible. Innovation being the same watch word for Capsum and for Genealogy. Premium Beauty News - Do you already have some products resulting from your partnership? Sébastien Bardon and Aea Marc - Yes, we have a first example with our joint collection RevOlution™. It consists of beads that are used to convey such values as luxury with caviar, of efficiency through the possibility to encapsulate and deliver high-potential actives which are however often difficult to stabilize, of sensoriality with very sophisticated and visually very beautiful textures. Each creation is designed so that each woman gets a visual, olfactory and sensory experience and can understand what is happening inside a product, and why not even play with it. We have combined in this collection: technology, high-quality cosmetic formulas and consumer experience. The packaging is very elaborated and ensures the transformation of beads into refined cosmetic products. The official launch of RevOlution™ will take place in Bologna during the Cosmoprof, we will then be present at In-Cosmetics in Barcelona, MakeUp in Paris and MakeUp in New York. Premium Beauty News - What is your target market? Sébastien Bardon and Aea Marc - It is broad and adaptable according to formulas. We cover the premium with the serOm™ but we also have more affordable products. Each brand can be served by Capsum and Genealogy and for long too because we’re only at the beginning."
Maesa wants to reinforce its activities on the high end,"Taking full advantage of its two R&D and formulation laboratories (one in Paris specialized in beauty products, the other one in Los Angeles specialized in home fragrances) and of its three design studios (Paris, New York and Los Angeles), the group has won several new customers in 2011, in Europe and in the United States too: El Corte Inglés (3 complete lines of skincare, bath products and home fragrances), Superdry (a perfume), Galeries Lafayette (a range of bath products), Hunkemuller (a range of make-up products and perfumes), Decleor, Montblanc, Aldo, Hot Topic, Benefit, Juicy Couture, Ralph Lauren, Oscar de la Renta. Many line extensions were also carried out with the portfolio of existing clients: Zara, Nocibé, Women’s Secret, Sephora, L’Oréal, Payless, Victoria’s Secret, Kim Kardashian, etc. In the end, the group produced more than 2,000 references in 2011, with an increase - in constant exchange rate - of 8% of its turnover over 2010. A growth which is lower than in previous years (in 2010 the turnover had increased by 30%) but, explains Julien Saada, co-founder and Chairman of the group, ""profitability has been improved."" A somewhat battered profitability after the takeover in 2009 of two U.S. companies. ""For the coming years, our goal is to return to 10-15% profit on equity,"" emphasised Saada. But this will be achieved outside the stock market! The Maesa Group, which was listed in Paris on the Alternext market has, in fact, chosen to leave the stock market at the end of 2011 and to finance its growth with the help of a new financial partnership, namely, the company Edmond de Rothschild Investment Partner (EDRIP). In practice, the group’s actions were transferred to a holding (F&B Group) in which EDRIP has a minority stake of 11%. ""The stock market has not helped the group in its development, our acquisitions were made with bank loans,"" explains Saada. So leaders at Maesa preferred to focus on their market and on the long-term growth of the group, rather than on the tedious communications imposed by financial market regulations. To achieve its growth and profitability targets, Maesa of course intends to strengthen itself on the market that made its success: the creation of complete and tailored lines for retail chains, often not familiar with the cosmetic world. And this logically implies winning new customers and developing existing accounts. On this front, the year 2012 has started rather well since the first half should see the launch of the first creations designed for Marks & Spencer, Next, and Kruidvat (with the first fragrance under its own name for the group) in Europe, or for Kohl’s in the States United, who previously used to entrusted the develop its own brand to Estee Lauder. ""We have about 80 customers worldwide in the distribution sector, is a lot but there is still some room for further growth,"" believes Saada. Plans are also underway with Zara, Nocibé, or Superdry in Europe, with Payless, Kim Kardashian and L’Oréal in the United States. But the group also wants to attract new luxury brands and reinforce its full-service activity on this market. Indeed, in addition to their packaging and their promotions, brands do not hesitate to entrust Maesa with the developments of whole segments. ""This is a general trend, believes Saada, competitive pressure is forcing brands to concentrate their resources on marketing, operational activities and distribution, which leads to a relative decrease in investments dedicated to development. But as they also have the obligation to market still more products to remain competitive, they rely on external partners."" A market which, compared to retail, has three advantages, namely of high added value, of a lesser dependence to economic conditions, and of potentially larger volumes, but where the group must face a much more intense competitive pressure. Maesa has therefore redeployed its sales force in the United States and Europe and created a Commercial & Marketing Management specialised in luxury brands, headed by Sophie Thiolas. The group is also betting on both the innovation capacity of its design studio (6 people in Paris and a new tool for 3D creation capable of displaying products in a real situation in a context of final merchandising) and on  its R&D laboratory in Paris, with a regulatory service and a constant monitoring of new ingredients and new textures. However, no geographical expansion has been planned in the short or medium term, Maesa wanting to focus on its European and American customers. ""But it is clear that China and Brazil have a strong potential which could be of interest to Maesa,"" concluded Saada."
"""From logo to launch!""","On March 18, 1962 Edward Marcus takes the decision of launching his company. At the time, his professional background comes down to some good technical knowledge in the food industry and on some strong commercial assets acquired in the perfume sector. He is the first one at the time in the United States to realize the value of establishing a service company for the filling and packaging of essential oils. Seduced by the name of a street in Brooklyn, he calls his company ""Grafton."" Four years later, Grafton Products activities have sky-rocketed and the company fills each year some 40 million bottles of perfume and eau de cologne. It was not until 1981 that Grafton, at the request of several customers, got involved in filling activities for cosmetic and skincare products. In 1985, the decision was taken to mainly specialize in this segment of cosmetics and Steven Marcus joins what is known now as Grafton Cosmetics.  That was ""THE"" great idea! Many small and medium companies were looking at the time for a supplier in the United States, capable of providing them with their full range of colour cosmetics. But not just supply but also develop and create. Grafton Cosmetics’ team excels in this area. The company can add to its production tool, the means to print the client’s logo on the packaging and that is when emerged the famous slogan, ""from Logo to launch""! But filling and packaging are not the only assets of the firm in Boynton Beach, Florida. Very quickly, Steven Marcus understood the benefits to the company if it went further in terms of innovation and developments of custom formulations. More than packaging, a whole new generation of customers wishes to find a partner company to help them create their own brand around a strong identity. ""Today, our range is very wide,"" explains Marcus. ""Eyes, lips, face... we offer a wide range of classic and mineral products but we can also work on more specific lines. All our products and raw materials are made in the United States.”  Grafton has a range of 220 different shades just for eye shadows, and nearly forty for foundations. Grafton Cosmetics offers a range of products for ""women of all colours."" ""Currently 80% of our customers are American, emphasises Steven Marcus, but our share of European customers, especially from England, Belgium, Sweden and France, is gradually increasing, in South America too, not to mention countries like New Zealand, Australia and Japan.” The key assets of Grafton stand in its colour range based on minerals and paraben-free products, its ability to supply small quantities and its capacity for innovation. Latest launches to date, ""LipLuxe,"" a series of seven shades of lip gloss, and mineral lipsticks that literally have a ""volume"" effect on lips for several hours. ""You can feel instantly a tingling and invigorating freshness on the lips as if they were naturally plumped,"" explains Myra Kenigsman Sales Manager/Aesthetician. Each year, following the fashion trends, Grafton launches several collections elaborated by Cheryl Marcus, the Creation and Product Development Director. The mission of Grafton Cosmetics in the beauty industry, is to offer its clients full support in the creation of their successful private label brand with quality products and marketing support.  “Needless to say, Grafton Cosmetics products are never tested on animals,” the company claims."
Faber-Castell Cosmetics under the sign of growth!,"""And what’s interesting,"" explains Stefano Castelletti, CEO, ""is that this growth was mostly achieved with both our new and our standard products. We are progressing on both fronts and we have gained shares on quite a few new markets with our core products, particularly in Europe."" “A big success for us and our customers was Tint’ N’ Gloss.” A convenient two-sided product with integrated lip balm developed and produced by Faber-Castell Cosmetics which achieved the German Glammy 2011 and is counted among the best cosmetics innovations in 2011. The main trends on which the German firm could take advantage of at a product level were: the consumer craze for ""Jumbo"" pencils and the success of new paraben-free formulas. In terms of recent successes for the teams of Faber-Castell Cosmetics, there is a luxurious lip formula available as medium-sheer “Moisturizing Power Lipbalm” or as “Some like it Hot” a rich, saturated, wet-shine lipstick where ""an extraordinary pigmentation provides visual depth combined to a rich moisturizing finish"", explained Stefano Castelletti. The packaging is a PVC-free plastic sharpenable pencil, with a barrel in customized colours. ""A good enough year 2011 and very encouraging 2012 forecasts that can only invite us to continue our investments to meet demand,"" explains Castelletti. A further proof, if needed, that the watchwords at the Group headquarters in Nuremberg remain ""continue to invest in technology"" in Germany and ""increase the value added."" Foreign branches only being designed to supply local markets. ""Not to forget, the most important fact,"" concludes Stefano Castelletti ""the proximity to our customers and their markets, we exhibit world-wide at global and regional fairs. The shows in Bologna, Paris, New York and São Paulo were a big success and we are looking forward to the first event this year, the Cosmoprof|Cosmopak in Bologna to meet our international customer and present our novelties. And of course, to MakeUp in Paris and MakeUp in New York, the two events exclusively dedicated the make-up industry suppliers."""
Florida: Oxygen’s new plant is operational!,"The least one can say is that this company has done remarkably well since its creation, just 10 years ago through the impetus of its founder, Philippe Cohen. At the start of 2012, Oxygen has acquired the ’state of the art’ in terms of manufacturing and packaging of cosmetics by moving its production tool just a few miles away in a brand new factory hosting cutting edge equipments for R&D, formulation and filling operations. ""This is actually the trend,"" says Philippe Cohen. ""Brands come to us because they know our reputation for developing new products."" More than fifteen people are involved daily in Research and Development in the nine laboratory rooms of the company. The company can manufacture just about anything or almost (powders, mascaras, lipsticks, foundations, lip gloss, as well as skincare creams and hair products). From year to year, thanks to this new production tool, Oxygen has all of a sudden stepped up its production capacity by 300% when compared to the potential of its previous factory. ""The objectives being of course, to better serve our existing customers in North America, precisely at a time when the Made in America is back into force in people’s minds,"" emphasises Philippe Cohen, ""but also to give ourselves the means to grow on overseas markets, like Central America, South America and even Europe at a time when, the euro/dollar parity is more favourable. Not to mention our reputation for responsiveness the American way!"""
Oekabeauty: New investments in 2012,"The first tangible results of these developments being the marketing as of this month of January of a whole range of new mascara brushes and new lips applicators like the ""Palm Sensation,"" a patented lip-gloss applicator developed with students from a German university of Design whose main characteristic is to have a very soft and flexible tip enabling a great comfort of application. To note also the marketing of the ""Delashious Brushes"", a series of three different mini fibre-based mascaras brushes. Their very specific size make them particularly efficient to work on ""volume"" and ""nature-like"" aspects. To note again the launch of another new brush, ""Diamond Brush"" also made of fibres which has the characteristic of being ""diamond"" shaped, enabling a perfectly uniform application of the formula while respecting the sought for ""volume"" effects. A series of innovations in fibre brushes which clearly shows the desire of the Oekabeauty management to invest even more heavily on this market in 2012. ""Especially in the development of new assembly machines and in the cutting of fibres,"" we were told at the company’s headquarters in Bamberg. A 2012 year which will also be placed under the sign of an increased cooperation of the firm with its partners in formulation to continue to offer the best combinations between brushes and/or applications and the mascara and/or gloss formulas."
Florame: an innovation per year and per segment!,"But how on earth did Romain Ruth, a 33 year old Parisian lawyer specialized in criminal law, find himself two years ago, managing a company with an expertise in essential oils and organic cosmetics, in Saint Rémy de Provence? Certainly because of a genetic passion instilled long ago by his father Olivier Ruth, who had already left the mark of his passage in several successful companies (Le Petit Marseille, L’Occitane) before creating in 1997 the Durance brand, well inspired by the Lavandin de Grignan. This is where the Provence Nature Développement group was born around this idea of terroir and fine raw materials, with the acquisition of Florame in 2002, Collines de Provence (home fragrances and natural cosmetics) in 2004 and of Présent Simple (local traditions and gastronomy of Provence) in 2007. All this has the unmistakable scent of Provence, but not only, as some essential oils come from more exotic lands. Like ylang ylang, geranium or ravinsara, originating from Madagascar where Florame is involved in a development program. ""We have the largest catalogue of essential oils in the world, with products coming from the five continents,"" emphasises Ruth. This is also what motivated his decision: a passion for the product and its production channel that goes from the producer to the point of sale, but also a passion for a sensoriality which is specific to this universe. Not to mention a taste for international challenges, and the pleasure to participate to a family adventure with his father and his brother Nicolas (at the head of Durance). Currently, Florame achieves 11.5 million euros in turnover, equally divided between essential oils and organic cosmetics, and with 85% achieved in France. The brand is distributed through its owned shops and salons in France. Nathalie Rigaud is the one who monitors the brand’s international development, already present in 35 countries (Europe, Asia and North America). ""Our formulas are the ones, on the market, with the highest percentages in organic ingredients,"" stresses Ruth who continues to communicate on the basic values of the company: its Provençal roots, its organic nature, its high-quality active ingredients using of a cold pressed extraction or a distillation performed in the traditional way, with AB and/or Cosmébio labels and an Ecocert certification. The R&D and formulation laboratory which has been integrated to the group for many years under the supervision of Laurent Lefaucheur, develops all the new lines. ""We have biological treasures, essential and vegetables oils to develop skin care and toiletries products, perfumes and home fragrances, even organic candles with their bio cotton wicks: our ambition is to market a novel product per segment each year,"" explains Ruth. In 2011, it was the new line Nutrition Intense, with organic essential oils, enriched with organic shea for the well-being of dry and fragile skins. But also a purifying bio spray, an organic sunscreen with an SPF of 50 which does go  white when applied and the must have, a USB key that diffuses essential oils using ultrasounds to disperse molecules without heating them. Located on the site of Saint Rémy, the quality department, equipped with spectrographs and chromatographs and headed by Aude Cabrera, validates the quality of all essential oils entering the site (about 140 different for aromatherapy and organic cosmetics), but also of packagings, good practices, traceability, and the results of safety tests carried out for finished products. And eco-design in all this? ""What suits us best are large volumes, like 1 litre size shower gels!"" summarizes Ruth who is slowly but surely developing his company towards the fair and sustainable, with a carbon footprint underway and programmed zero pesticides operations. And because the social dimension of a company ""is not necessarily at the other end of the world,"" he has set up a participation for the employees of Florame. Physician, heal thyself..."
Jackel - LF Beauty fully invests the segment of instrumental beauty,"Premium Beauty News - Obviously Jackel - LF Beauty had all the necessary legitimacy to offer a range of products on this booming new market? Bruno Clamens -  Absolutely! Remember that, historically, before becoming a major player in the luxury and beauty industry, Jackel was originally a manufacturer of electrical products for childcare such as, for example, bottle warmers or even electric sterilizers. The childcare segment is very demanding in terms of compliance with hygiene, nutrition, safety and electrical regulations, we are therefore perfectly legitimate in this area. We know how to ""heat"", ""cool"", ""diffuse vapour"", ""recreate a vibration"", ""sterilize"", ""dry"", ""detect"", ""use ultrasounds"" and so on. We took the best from both worlds: our know-how in electrical appliances and our expertise in high-end packaging, in order to offer products which technically and aesthetically meet the expectations of prestige brands. It is really only fairly recently that this activity has been developing strongly under the pressure of increasingly demanding customers, especially in the beauty segment. Premium Beauty News -  An annual growth rate of up to 50% is being assumed for the United States alone! Bruno Clamens -  But it’s not just the United States. Demand is growing strongly in Asia and Europe. This corresponds to two major trends, compounded by the aging of the population: the growing market of well-being and the concept of home beauty institutes. Premium Beauty News - Finally, who are your customers? Bruno Clamens -  First of all, of course, cosmetic brands followed by all possible means of distribution (stores, internet, home shopping, etc..). I must insist on the fact that our offering has nothing to do with gadgets. It consists of truly technical products, often quite complex, that must be reliable and offer a real plus in terms of efficiency to the consumer. Premium Beauty News -  In fact, in your range, there’s something for everyone? Bruno Clamens - The range never stops growing. I must say that the scope of possible uses is extremely broad. This concerns nails with the development, among others, of UV nail dryers, skincare, eyelash care, body care... These instruments may feature various functions like cooling or heating, massaging, smoothing, moistening, facilitating skin cleaning or the penetration of a formula. They often come in support of cosmetic products which can therefore be applied or absorbed by the skin the best possible way."
"Jean-François Harpes, President IL Cosmetics: ""Towards an acceleration of our investment""","Premium Beauty News - Nail polish is always a growth market! Jean-François Harpes -  It’s the least we can say since the market has recorded a two digit growth in 2011. Although it is difficult to consider these figures in absolute terms, it is clear that the European and US market have been rising sharply. The growth of IL Cosmetics is certainly in correlation to that of the global market, but it is mainly due to the strong momentum which has been generated in recent years within the company. Premium Beauty News - What momentum precisely? Jean-François Harpes - You may recall that in 2010, we had launched a major investment plan of 11 million euros. This plan was originally planned for a period of five years. Given the economic situation and the current growth of the company the pace of this investment has been stepped up and will certainly be completed before term. Premium Beauty News - What are the strong points of your next investments? Jean-François Harpes - Our investments concern both equipments and the workforce. We can actually announce a significant increase in the capacity of the three branches that form our business: 1. Components.  Components are critical since they are required to be able to make the bulk. Our total capacity was doubled on the 1st of January 2012. 2 The Bulk.  Bulk shades are intended to booming foreign markets and a key factor of success in the third branch: the full-service.  The doubling of our production capacity will be effective during the third quarter of 2012. 3. Full-service. The 50% increase of our production capacity will be effective on the 1st of February 2012. Our global capacity will thus equal 800 million bottles of nail polish, that is to say a quarter of the world’s entire market. Premium Beauty News - And in terms of workforce, then? Jean-François Harpes - IL cosmetics is not only investing in equipment but we are also focusing on reinforcing our sales, management and marketing teams with a doubling of the current workforce by 2013 as well as a strong emphasis on quality and innovation, two hubs that will see their number of people increase by 50% in 2012. The innovation hub is the result of the symbiosis and dynamics between the marketing and development departments and has an aim to always stay in tune with markets: to capture their needs, understand them and to then translate them into a product response that satisfies the expectations of the end consumer. This implies a thorough and constant analysis of the reasons why consumers choose and buy a product rather than another. Innovation stands therefore as a key driver not only to give us the means to offer new formulas in line with the findings of our consumer surveys but also to anticipate their future needs. Innovation also remains a hub focused on novelty, hence our special collections and new formulations that will be showcased at Cosmoprof Bologna 2012."
AmorePacific bets on Asian growth to enter the top 10,"AmorePacific plans to complete the construction of its new Shanghai Production & Research Centre in March 2013.  With 92,788 sqm of land area and 41,001 sqm of building area, the new facility will have an annual production capacity of 7,500 tons and one hundred million units, a 16-fold increase compared to current capabilities.  The production will be organized so as to address the needs of both diversified small-quantity production and mass production. The new facility will be used as the main production, research and distribution hub for serving the Chinese market, with the aim to accelerate the company’s business in the country, explained Suh Kyung-Bae, CEO of AmorePacific. The group aims to grow its sales by more than 30 percent in China, to reach 1.4 billion yuan (221 million USD) in 2012, compared to 1.04 billion yuan in 2011. The domestic market will also be key in the Korean group’s attempt to become one of the top 10 global cosmetics marketers by 2015.  AmorePacific expects the Korean market to grow by 9.1% in 2012 to reach 9.7 trillion wons (8.5 billion USD), compared to 8.9 trillion wons (7.7 billion USD) in 2011 [1].  Over the last five years, cosmetics sales in Korea grew at an average annual rate of 10.4%. According to AmorePacific, “the biggest issue on the cosmetics market in 2011 was the rebound of One-brand shop, which recorded 32.1% growth and showed the highest growth of all cosmetics market channels.”  Thanks to “quick response to consumer needs, increased product types, enhanced quality, and the development of a wide range of items” this retail channel should carry on growing at a similar pace in 2012. The other most dynamic retail channels are the internet (+11.9% forecasted in 2012) and department stores should (+ 9.6% forecasted in 2012). AmorePacific also foresees strong growth opportunities in the men’s cosmetics market, which has been steadily growing at an average annual rate of 13.2% since 2007 in Korea.  According to the group, the men’s market achieved a 13.4% growth in 2011.  “Products especially developed for Korean men’s skin are also doing their share of growth on the domestic cosmetics market.  ‘Hera Homme Magic Skin Essence,’ a moisturizing essence product for men, was developed by taking into account the nature of Korean men’s skin with ‘high sebum production and less moisture.’ This is a steady-seller, recording over 10% growth annually as a unique item among men’s cosmetics. It proves that men’s cosmetics are no longer simply limited to basic toner and lotion,” the company explains. However, the Korean market is also affected by the current economic turmoil. “Due to high inflation, the disposable income of consumers decreased and they demonstrated cautious purchasing behaviour,” AmorePacific says.  As a consequence, Korean consumers tend to put more stress on the real qualities of products rather than on brands. Price sensitivity also increased.  “The ‘Value Consumption’ trend is forecast to continue for the time being. The polarization of consumption according to income level is worsening, and it seems that it will be accompanied by polarized consumption according to product types.”"
L’Oréal confirms its commitment towards Asian suppliers,"More than 380 people were invited to attend the latest edition of the L’Oreal Asia Pacific Supplier Convention, on December 1st, at the Intercontinental Expo Hotel in Shanghai. The long list of attendees represented over 150 suppliers from four purchasing domains (Raw Material, Packaging Material, Contract Manufacturing & Capital Expenditure) across the Asia Pacific region and nearly 60 staff from L’Oreal Asia Operation Divisions, L’Oreal China R&I and L’Oreal Europe Sourcing Center. “Following last year’s L’Oreal Supplier Day in Hong Kong, which was more focusing on strategy and vision sharing, L’Oreal Asia Pacific Supplier Convention, aimed at the down-to-earth interactions with suppliers,” explains the French cosmetics giant in a release. Speeches were delivered about L’Oreal’s operation expansions in the Asia Pacific region and ethical sourcing issues. They were followed by several programs and workshops designed to encourage interactive discussions to progress towards “common improvements”. The social audit program has been a hot topic in the event due to the suppliers’ increasing awareness of the importance of social responsibility. Supply Chain Efficiency & Lean Production program has been demonstrated with a real case from one of L’Oreal’s selected suppliers on how to become lean and therefore to bring mutual benefits to the supplier and L’Oreal. Meanwhile, concerning the group’s four different purchasing domains, tailor-made workshops have been designed, in particular regarding E-bidding and quality chart trainings for Contract Manufacturing and Packaging Material suppliers, specific programs for raw material suppliers, etc. Finally, the group’s Supplier Management Program was introduced to all the attendees. “This program is about managing expectations from suppliers and from stakeholders. Supplier survey program, supplier scorecard, supplier rating system and supplier incentive program were elaborated in this session,” L’Oreal says. According to L’Oreal, just a few days after the event, emails and phone calls were received from many suppliers not only expressing their appreciations and congratulations but also addressing their strong interests in different subjects presented in the event. “To mention one of the vivid cases, one supplier from south of China had tried hard to find solutions to increase production efficiency and reduce cost and waste but with little progress during the past years. Nevertheless, this supplier was glad to witness the program of Supply Chain Efficiency & Lean Production as delivered in the event. They came to L’Oreal immediately after the event and were so anxious to know more about this program and wanted to get a systematic training with the help from L’Oreal.” These workshops and trainings should have a far-reaching influence with regard to the future business relationship between L’Oreal and its suppliers.  Taking into consideration the positive feedback from suppliers, L’Oréal considers this kind of events will become a regular exchange platform with them.  “There is no doubt that we have paved the way for L’Oreal’s sustainable development and innovations with the full dedications and supports from our suppliers,” the group concludes."
Purainova: A fine French story in Brazil!,"Premium Beauty News -  Yet you did not really have the profile of an entrepreneur who sets off alone on a big adventure? Joël Ponte - It’s true! Before this date of February 2009, my professional background in the beauty industry was more the one, a little classical, of a senior manager who, so to speak, ""appropriately"" started his career end of 1986, at L’Oréal as a product manager for Lancôme. In 1989, I was given the opportunity to create the Group’s subsidiary in Indonesia. Between 1994 and the end of 1995, I became Deputy General Manager of Lancôme. Then, a new opportunity to expatriation arose, this time in Brazil, where I took in 1996 the General management of the Luxury Products Division. These will surely be remembered as my best years abroad and the start of a continued commitment to this country. In 1999, I returned again to France as Managing Director of the Perfume Division. It was at that time of my life that I made an encounter that will completely change not only my approach of the business but also bring me a little closer to Brazil. The man behind this encounter is named Luiz Seabra, the founder of Natura. A few figures enable to measure the gone through road by a man who created from scratch in 1969 a company to manufacture and distribute cosmetics and whose empire is now worth two billion euros in sales, all this only relying on a single concept, the one of direct sales thanks to the ""busy-bee work"" carried out by nearly a million ""consultants."" These very ""consultants"" who are also able to sell products with dugout canoes in the depths of the Amazon. Premium Beauty News -  But most importantly, from this encounter with the founder of Natura will emerge a collaboration that will last several months! Joël Ponte -  Absolutely! And this may make a few people smile, but I realized that L’Oréal was not the centre of the world. This was the time when leaders at Natura were reflecting on the way to change the Group’s business model especially outside Latin America. This will result in the opening of a Natura store in France in April 2005. In fact, what we had in mind with the opening of outlets was more to have a flag ship shop who would serve as a reference for the brand while developing at the same time a direct sales network. The same strategy will then be developed in Russia, England, United States. But my job also consists as of 2006 in analysing the strengths and weaknesses of the brand. Very quickly, we understand that the strong image of the company, based on natural products, and which is naturally present in the collective imagination of consumers should better match the formulas, the graphics and the design of product lines. ""History must be visible! "" A task that will last three years! Premium Beauty News - Then at the end of 2008, it is the financial and economic crisis. But it is also at that moment that you realize both the potential of the dermo-cosmetic sector and the development opportunities available in this segment, specially in Brazil where obviously women visit their dermatologist to look more beautiful! So, you decide to start out! Joël Ponte - Yes, in fact it’s typically Brazilian! Don’t forget that the association of dermatologists in Brazil is the largest one in the world after the United States! Yes, I start out in February 2009, on my own, in the creation of my company with a strong idea in mind: use one of the characteristics that make Brazil stand out: the country’s fantastic network of mineral spring waters, more than 400..., find the one that best suits the criteria of purity and balance which are keys to the development of skincare lines matching the characteristics of Brazilian skin. And it will be the source ""Serra do Japi."" Premium Beauty News -  The name is well chosen, ""Purainova""! Joël Ponte - Well, at least it is perfectly evocative of the almost unique and patented concept that we developed after much thorough research work with the active participation of renowned dermatologists and numerous tests. This initially resulted in three product lines, one line for sensitive skin, two night and day anti-aging products, a line of mineral waters in a spray - including a patent for a mineral water transported by liposomes. End of 2011, we launched a line for oily skin and a line of sunscreens. Premium Beauty News -  But it is not enough to just find and produce the perfect product! Il it also necessary to have it distributed to as many people as possible... Joël Ponte - It’s a huge challenge that can only be evaluated, as an individual entrepreneur, when your are confronted to it. We had a strategic line and we did our best to stick to it. The one of distributing before all in the network of pharmacies and drugstores. There are 60,000 pharmacies in Brazil. We also have 15 representatives who regularly visit more than 2,000 dermatologists. For our brand Purainnova, the potential, is of about 3,000 to 3,500 outlets. We are already present in 400 of them. Premium Beauty News -  And financially? Joël Ponte - From our starting point in 2009, we knew we needed three years to find our balance. This balance will be reached in 2013. We deliberately chose to create our own laboratory and to have our own sales force. This necessarily requires substantial initial investments. But the results are there. The success of our products is undeniable thanks to their quality and to the accuracy of their positioning versus the Brazilian demand, but also because of our price policy."
Brazil-based Mappel increased its full service capacity for the perfume sector,"Premium Beauty News - When visiting your Diadema plant in Sao Paulo, one can only be surprised by the high industrial level of the facilities. Marion Appel - This is one of the keys to our success. Invest..., invest always more to be at the highest level in terms of quality and to provide an industrial response on this perfume and cosmetic sector. This represents an average of over 10% of our turnover every year. And our current investment plan to increase our capacity and meet demand in the perfume sector is a proof of this. The market has needs, we answer them... And we do it by giving ourselves the means. Premium Beauty News - In deciding, four years ago, to open a brand new plant in Diadema, in addition to the other plant that you own in Sao Bernardo do Campo, you have clearly chosen the option of ""total full service""! Marion Appel - Absolutely! The plant in Sao Bernardo do Campo is mainly dedicated to the filling of samples and of different packagings in a dose format. We had to meet demand in terms of full service, in other words, integrate the manufacture and conditioning of formulas, all this with a very practical ""pharmaceutical"" purpose, even (and I am tempted to say ""mostly"") when it concerns products for the cosmetic industry. Hence our investment in this plant in Diadema four years ago for nearly 5 million Reals, a factory we wanted to be at the cutting edge in terms of industrial installations. As you remember, at Diadema, we produce and condition skincare, bodycare and haircare products, not to mention baby lotions, sunscreens, etc. And the whole of it, I repeat, in an industrial background that I wanted ultra-modern, with cleanrooms complying with pharmaceutical standards, manufacturing and blending equipments but also filling and packaging machines that are what technology has best to offer. With our two plants, the one in Sao Bernardo do Campo and the one in Diadema, we have no less than 25 filling machines. Premium Beauty News - A key step currently underway, an increase in the production capacity for the perfume industry that will make of you one of the biggest players in Brazil in terms of full service for the beauty industry. Marion Appel - We can say that we are today one of the forerunners in this area. And just for the segment concerning the production of sample sachets, we can say without hesitation that we currently have more than half of the market shares in Brazil. Our growth in this niche of full service, particularly thanks to this production unit in Diadema proves, if need be, that it was imperative to diversify and meet growing demand. This is obviously what brought uscloser to the strategy developed by the managers of the Ileos group when we decided to discuss the integration of our activities, last year, with their subsidiary Bioplan. And, as you know, to reach an agreement recently. The synergies between both groups are obvious and our mutual expertise can only enrich the quality of our offer to our clients in Brazil but also with the clients we share at an international level and who are seeking to strengthen their operations in Brazil."
Fareva: The new Brazilian plant will be operational soon,"Originality of the concept, following an agreement signed between the two groups last March, Tubex and Fareva, the aerosol cans and then the aluminium and plastic tubes will be manufactured on site in an adjoining building of 5,000 m² under the responsibility precisely of Tubex, an Austrian company, whose turnover this year will reach EUR 150 million, for 1200 employees and which is owned by a group weighing EUR 1.4 billion in turnover for a total of over 6000 people including such companies as Neumann Aluminium, Glanzstoff, Stoelzle, Prefa GmbH, etc. A second EUR 7 million phase planned for mid-2013 will enable to step up the capacity for formulation and the filling of bottles for the perfume industry to 120 million units, that of aerosols to 100 million and that of cosmetic liquids to 40 million. To note also in this second phase, the implementation of a ""cream"" line capable of producing some 15 million units a year. Finally a third EUR 7 million phase planned for early 2015 will enable to increase the ""perfume"" capacity to 168 million units per year, that of aerosols to 140 million, the one of liquid cosmetics to 60 million and the ""cream"" line to 60 million. To note that the Fareva group has also made plans to manufacture in the short and medium-term some roll-ons, sticks, tubes, make-up products, soaps, etc. An operation totalling in three years nearly 40 million euros! At the same time the Tubex company, a partner to the operation, will have produced in the end about 250 million cases per year, 75 million aluminium tubes and just as many plastic tubes. ""To be present where our customers need us"", explains Thibaut Fraisse, Project Manager at Fareva, ""it’s really our mission and this Brazilian unit epitomizes this spirit perfectly. Our clients are the major local groups and the large international ones""."
Formulation: Nippon Shikizai invests in France,"After spending in France 6.2 million euros in 2003 in a brand new production facility intended to host the colour cosmetic activity, the company has just commissioned its first machine called ""back injection"", which enables the manufacturing of compacts and/or eye shadows in automatic or by injecting directly up to four different shades and/or textures through the base of the pans. Since October 15th the company Thépenier Pharma Industrie, a subsidiary of the Japanese Group Nippon Shikizai, is able to produce compact and/or eye shadow under this new technique called ""Back injection"". ""Main assets, explains Sylvie Coudray, Sales manager of Thépenier Pharma Industrie, an extensive experience in the conditioning of colour cosmetics, in packaging, the possibility to inject several colours and/or textures simultaneously, the design of extremely varied patterns since it is possible to inject in a hollow imprint, and ultimately, achieve very high quality products, especially products with glitters.""  Not forgetting, of course, a substantial improvement in productivity. After acquiring the French company in 2000, the Japanese group is demonstrating its determination to conquer the European industry of colour cosmetics. Colour cosmetics, a segment, that its leaders know well. Founded in 1957 Nippon Shikizai employs more than 230 people and achieves about half of its turnover in this segment. Fifty people work daily in the R&D department. Since the acquisition of Thépenier Pharma Industrie, there has been a great deal of technology transfers between the two companies, especially in the field of the production of compact and fluid foundations, of mascara and lip gloss. The new production unit dedicated to this activity which was built in 2003 in Saint-Langis-Lès-Mortagne, in Normandy, will have cost the hefty sum of 6.2 million euros and investments have not stopped with the acquisition of this new so-called ""Back Injection"" machine. ""To note that in a different domain, explains Coudray, we have also acquired a real expertise in the production of BB creams (BB for blemish balm. A cream that nourishes, soothes, conceals red spots and protects against sun burns. The BB cream has several functions. It hydrates, unifies, refines skin texture and conceals imperfections)""."
Comptoir Sud Pacifique wants to reconnect with its roots,"When she took over Comptoir Sud Pacifique in November 2010, Valérie Pianelli-Guichard was aware that the challenge she was imposing herself would be difficult to take up. The small size French company, sold by its founders to investors operating in the world of high-end perfumery was in a delicate situation after several negative years. ""A series of bad strategic and marketing choices led to a loss in turnover and notoriety"", explains this pharmacist who graduated from the ESSEC before previously working for the Pierre Fabre group. The story of Comptoir Sud Pacifique started in the early 1970s. The brand emerged from the imagination of Josée and Pierre Fournier, a couple fascinated by perfumes and travels. The fragrances they composed at the time from varieties of flowers, of resins, or of fruits brought back from their journeys disturb the codes of the time but gradually increased the loyalty of demanding customers in search of originality and quality. The brand then developed itself using a concept of traditional, creative perfume niche, and opens some outlets in Paris, Le Touquet or Saint-Tropez, and owned up to five outlets in France bearing its name. The outlets also proposed some luggage, toiletries and even beach linen. When in 2002 the founders sold their company, the new owners sought to get the brand out of its cottage industry-like world by focusing more on multi-brand distribution networks. They closed the outlets, dropped complementary lines to focus on perfumes of which they streamlined the portfolio, the number of fragrances in the catalogue being then cut down from 54 to 17. The brand’s creations then claiming to be more accessible to a wider audience. But this new strategy turned out being disappointing. The brand lost its followers, without however managing to find its place in the face of its competitors in the selective market. The traditional customer base in search of differentiation no longer seemed to find its share of new products that also failed to attract a new audience. Since she took over with passion the reins of the company, Valérie Pianelli-Guichard’s first objective was to bring accounts back into balance. Which was successfully achieved, since with a turnover of 1 million euros, the balance has become positive again, thanks to the good results performed by export sales where the brand achieves 2/3 of its turnover, the United States, Italy (200 outlets) and Germany (80 outlets) being the three most important markets. Operations were also developed in new European countries, like the Baltic States and Ukraine. And projects are underway in Asia. France, which accounts for one third of sales, is of course a strategic market. Comptoir Sud Pacifique currently has 180 point of sales in France, plus department stores (Printemps, Galeries Lafayette), but this network is being rationalized. ""Our goal is to reposition the brand in exclusivity. We want to give ourselves the means to work well with key accounts, in particular by investing in the training of counsellors and in the animation of outlets"", explained Agathe Finaz de Villaine, Marketing manager. Because after this transitional year, the goal is now to reconnect with the brand’s DNA to give it a new impetus. ""Comptoir Sud Pacifique is a fun niche brand very much unlike this segment sometimes characterized by an austere, cold intellectual side. It’s a brand that plays with ingredients, giving free rein to its customers audacity. In a nutshell, it’s the brand of pleasure perfumery"", explains Pianelli-Guichard. The brand’s revival will involve the development of many novelties, with first, the launch of a series of five new fragrances on the theme of travel, intended to bring the brand’s discourse and imagination in line with its history. Souffle des Indes, the first fragrance of this collection, developed in collaboration with the perfume creator, Henri Bergia, is a gourmand oriental, rich in contrasts between intoxicating spices and invigorating citrus. True to its origins, Comptoir Sud Pacifique is back again on the road that leads to exotic essences and surprising accords. As for packaging, it has also evolved towards a reconnection with the codes of the brand while also enjoying an update. The brand-specific model of steel-like coloured glass bottle remains unchanged but silk screen printing is abandoned in favour of a more sophisticated and more vintage label and an elegant beech cap to top the bottle. The case (Invercote cardboard, worked with the shiny side inside) was transformed. Comptoir Sud Pacifique inaugurated with this launch its new finish: a stitching of mixed turquoise and brown fawn, a nod to its history and a reminder of its former collections of bags and travel accessories associated to the brand. The next step will consist in giving the brand a range of skincare products worthy of its position. The current range consisting of three body care products made of tropical butters with a very summery positioning, is being completely revisited and should be enriched with face care and toiletry products. Finally, a luxurious line of scented candles is also planned. ""The common thread remains the same: the search for surprising and natural raw materials inviting us on a wonderful journey"", emphasises Pianelli-Guichard. The implementation of these various projects should enable the brand to enrich its offering and to dispose of a set of consistent products with, in focus, the reopening of an exclusive boutique in Paris planned in 2013 or early 2014. ""This is the horizon we have set ourselves with. But we don’t want to cut any corners, we don’t have unlimited means. Our priority is to strengthen the brand."""
Distribution: The FPPS focuses on social issues and training,"At 50 and after a career mostly spent in the world of human resources, Marie-Hélène Morin has just joined the Federation of French selective perfumery (FFPS) [1] as its General Delegate.   She succeeds Bernard Tessier who becomes advisor to the President. This employment law specialist is used to collective bargaining. She began her career in 1984 at CGEE Alsthom which later became Cegelec, then as Head of Social Affairs at Davum Armatures, a subsidiary of Usinor Sacilor (Arcelor Mittal). In 1995 she leaves the industry for service providers to integrate Carglass as its Director of Human Resources and then joins in 1996, still as a HRD, the Minit Group who operates in France through two networks of specialized outlets: Mister Minit (230 points of sales), and Montre Service (55 points of sales). As of 2002, she is also in charge of the social relations of the multi service shoe repair branch and becomes the Vice-President of one of the employers’ organization, the SRIC (Syndicat des Réparateurs Industriels de la Chaussure - Union of Industrial Shoe repairers). First Priority: complete the cycle of negotiations on the new collective agreement for the selective perfumery. The former agreement was denounced in 2008 by all the employers’ organizations who wanted to distinguish clearly selective distribution from beauty treatments. ""The previous agreement in force dated back to 1978 and even included aesthetics schools, but the needs of distribution and the ones of beauty treatments are quite different"", explains the new General Delegate. ""At the end of the notice period of three years, the current agreement will expire October 28, 2011, and will therefore no longer be applicable.   Our objective is to reach an agreement before the end of 2012"", she added. It is a total of nearly 17,000 employees who are directly concerned. The other major project is training. ""This is a key issue. The core of perfume and cosmetic selective distribution depends of advice given, and therefore of the training of sales beauty consultants. Of course big names in the business have their own training centres, but for smaller structures there aren’t really any adapted solutions."" The main challenge is to find ways of training employees, without penalizing the activity, especially that of small independent structures. ""A reflection has already started, we will resume it with the aim of finding innovative solutions. At this point, all options are open, including the possibility of creating a academy under the aegis of the FFPS. But nothing has been decided yet, the reflection process is only starting again with also an important social component attached to it"", emphasised Morin."
"Coptis: A software saga, to better serve cosmetic laboratories","Premium Beauty News - It all began one day of 1999, you set off on a big adventure, you are only 33 years old. Anne Karagoz - It’s true! I start all by myself. The idea is simple but not necessarily easy to implement. It consists in setting up a database of active cosmetic ingredients. At the time, no such thing existed on the market. Premium Beauty News - Why Coptis? Anne Karagoz - Actually, I went through several phases in my quest for a name... It started with Cosmetic Data then Advisance to end up finally with this name derived from a Chinese herb, Coptis. It was simple, spoke for itself, and was evocative too. That’s all. Premium Beauty News - The beginnings were difficult? Anne Karagoz - Rather difficult, yes! Because from the concept to the realization of this type of database, needless to say that there was a long way to go! It was of course necessary to develop the entire architecture and interface. We had to contact and visit each of the suppliers of raw materials. Initially, I suggested they paid to be part of this database, but very quickly I realized that this approach was not credible. To insure that a majority of suppliers became members, we had to offer free membership and get the user instead to pay to access the database. Premium Beauty News - How did the suppliers welcome this approach? Anne Karagoz - They were delighted! Anyhow, there was never any blockage, on the contrary. In May 2001, the database contains several hundred of materials. In parallel, Coptis Lab sees the light and soon a few large customers place their trust in us. And I take the opportunity here, to thank them once again. These companies are Guinot, Inter Cosmétiques, Clarins, Cartier... Premium Beauty News - Today, Coptis Lab is your flagship product? But it is not the only one. Anne Karagoz - Coptis Lab is indeed our flagship product. It enables the cosmetic industry to efficiently manage its development projects, to reduce time to market and to improve the quality and reliability of information. Our teams of cosmetic chemists and of IT specialists ensure the continuous improvement of our products through our cosmetic expertise, our Users Club or the direct recommendations of our clients. In addition to our applications, we provide services with high added value enhancing their performance that include a documentary database describing more than 10 000 cosmetic raw materials, developed through partnerships with ingredients suppliers, a Coptis Lab integrated regulatory database elaborated through our regulatory groups and based on our clients’ expertise. Coptis Lab is a software specially designed for laboratories specialised in cosmetic formulation. It integrates the different development phases of a cosmetic formula, from the marketing brief to the compilation of the regulatory file. Coptis Lab is also meant for quality control laboratories. Coptis Ingredients identifies and describes more than 10 000 cosmetic raw materials under about thirty headings essential to formulators and regulatory departments (raw material presentation, functional classification, cosmetic properties, chemical nature, main origins, date of placing on the market, solubility, preserving agents, specifications, formulation conditions, applications, incompatibilities, percentage of use, storage conditions, shelf life, INCI names, regulatory restrictions, CAS and EINECS numbers, efficacy and toxicological data...). MSDS, product files and standard formulations are also accessible as electronic files. Raw materials are listed by manufacturer in order to guarantee unicity of information. Distributors are indicated for each country. Premium Beauty News - A success which seems to have even crossed national borders? In any case, in 2008 you have the feeling that you must cross the Atlantic Ocean So much so that now you live over there! Anne Karagoz - It’s true! Intuitively, I quickly have the feeling that we need to set foot in North America where there is no offer in this area. Meanwhile, we set up a network of agents in Europe, especially in Italy, Spain and Germany. Our first steps in the U.S. date back to 2009. Today, I’m working there with three colleagues. We are twelve in France. It is really not a problem to manage everything from New York. Premium Beauty News - You are obviously driven by the spiralling evolution of legislation on cosmetics in the world. Anne Karagoz - This is a good spur, indeed, for our customers and therefore for us. And the new cosmetic regulation that will be put in place in 2013 in Europe is not unrelated to this. Premium Beauty News - Any other projects in sight? Anne Karagoz -  Yes, a lot!"
Jean-Claude Biguine: 30 years next year!,"Premium Beauty News - It’s always difficult for a self made man to escape from his always unusual history! Brian Feinman - Yes indeed, there is no exception! But what an adventure!
There is a young man from Brittany, who opens his first hair salon at the age of 22. He starts by designing a very functional hair salon and offers his customers very affordable services. Quickly, he opens his second and third hair salon, and then ten... Premium Beauty News - What defines and influences from the start the Jean-Claude Biguine ""style""? Brian Feinman - The general public trend, easy to wear creations, everyday hairstyles free of stereotypes. Brown, blond or red haired women with long or short, smooth or straight hair, can be found without any distinction in his creations who ride on all strong current trends. Premium Beauty News - But there have been some key milestones in this singularity so specific to Jean-Claude Biguine? Brian Feinman - Yes, everyone remembers of course in 1992 the famous without appointment ""Shampooing/Brushing"" service offer for only 50 francs (less than 8 euros) inscribed in huge letterings on each shop front that will truly democratize hairstyle. Premium Beauty News - It true that at the time the trend was on franchised salons. Brian Feinman - Jean Claude Biguine was clearly one of the forerunners in this field with his first franchised salon in Chambly in 1989. He already owned at the time five other salons under his own name. And in 1990, he launches Biguine Magazine. Two years later, it is no less than 70 Jean-Claude Biguine salons that open up in France. Premium Beauty News - To this acceleration in France matches the first salon openings abroad. Brian Feinman - Absolutely! The first one opens in Italy in 1994. Followed by Japan, Belgium and the United States in 1996. Two years later, Jean Claude Biguine has developed a network of 270 salons in the whole world. India is the latest country to date where we have set foot and where we already have 6 prestigious Beauty Salons where we can already claim a leading position. Premium Beauty News - And with always one step ahead of competitors, it’s the launch of Biguine Make Up. Brian Feinman - This takes place in 1998. The year where I actually integrate the company with, among others, the task to launch this range of make-up products. I say ""among others"" since in quick succession were launched ranges of traditional face body and hair care products, aromatherapy and 100% organic natural hair styling, colouring products, accessories, electronic beauty, sunglasses and ready to wear. Incidentally, this line of colour cosmetics launched and distributed by the company Gade Eden hasn’t stopped growing with a development rate of its turnover of 5% for 2010/11. This range offers a broad array of products comprising more than 350 references with some product innovations for each season. The quality of design, and of textures, the trendy colours, and a good quality/price ratio all contribute to make it a high performance range. It is sold in the Group’s Beauty Salons as well as in department stores like Monoprix (where we rank in fourth position), Le Printemps, Galeries Lafayette and such perfumeries chain stores as Douglas and Nocibé. Premium Beauty News - In fact you have a multifunctional role? Brian Feinman - Absolutely. My role consists among other things, to monitor the development from the conceptual phase to market launch with our industrial partners (testing, formula validations, design, packaging design, setting up of specifications, manufacturing and quality control) as well as promotion, public relations and partnerships. Premium Beauty News - You have innovated with what you call ""manucure et beauté brésiliennes"" (Brazilian manicure and beauty). Brian Feinman - These are two new pleasant and healthy services we offer, to treat and beautify hands and feet. The kit comes in an individual bag. Each customer gets his own nail file and branchwood stick, as well as two gloves or boots pre-filled with a 100% natural creamy formula with a neutral pH containing several actives. The customer just needs to put on the glove and make a hole at the tip of the fingertips with the stick to treat the nails. The skin is nourished, moisturised with a silky feel. The skin and nails also look whiter. The hands are delicately scented. This product, manufactured in Brazil under the Balbcare brand, has a leading position in Brazil. Premium Beauty News -  Another innovation in your salons, Glossy Color - the new express service, hair make-up and the opening of a new outlet for the manicure and the beauty treatment of hands and feet! Brian Feinman - Glossy Color uses Dialight the new tone on tone coloration from L’Oréal Professionel. It’s an ammonia-free formula that respects the hair fibre. Like a hair ""make up"", Dialight imparts the hair with a Glossy effect that captures the light. Intended for women between 30 and 40, this service is perfect for those who are reluctant to make a first hair colouration, especially those looking for a glossy, very natural result, with no root effect. As for the opening of a new ""Biguine Nails"" outlet in Paris in the 7th arrondissement, it is actually a brand new and very promising concept."
"Amalia Marciano, Pacific World Corporation: ""Many launches in 2012!""","Premium Beauty News - For those who do not know Pacific World Corporation, can you tell a word about your company? Amalia Marciano - Pacific World Corporation subcontracts the manufacture and distribution of artificial nails (Nailene, Fing’rs, Revlon), of Revlon licensed false eyelashes, of cosmetic products for teens and tweens (GeoGirl, Fing’rs and Crayola licensed products) and the exclusive distribution of Bio-Oil (South African anti-stretch marks products). Premium Beauty News - What does the year 2011 look like, for your sector and more specifically your activity? And what are the prospects for 2012? Amalia Marciano - 2011 looks quite bright and we should post positive results, the company also acquired Fing’rs Europe located in Zurich (Switzerland). Many launches are expected in 2012 for all the brands mentioned above. Premium Beauty News - You are launching new products at an impressive pace! Amalia Marciano - In fact, launches never stop because the distribution network is the mass market with some temporary launches (displays) in seasonal departments at Wal-Mart, CVS... artificial nails require a rotation of the different designs every six months. Premium Beauty News - Who are your main suppliers? Amalia Marciano - For cost reasons, our suppliers are mainly located in Asia because margins on our products are quite high (our own margins and the margins of our key accounts). Premium Beauty News - What did you think of this first edition of MakeUp in New York? Amalia Marciano - I really enjoyed the show’s set up and presentation. Offers from exhibitors suited my expectations in terms research and requirements. The show was an opportunity to establish good contacts and there is already a follow up on some of them."
Bioware shares the ’made in France’ expertise,"Created fifteen years ago, the Laboratoires Bioware are a perfect example of the know-how of French SMEs in the cosmetic industry. The company which employs 20 people dedicated to development and creation and 65 more on the production site belonging to their parent company, produces annually about 700 tons of cosmetic products for the face, the body and the hair. Customers are located in thirty different countries. ""Asia comes first in our customer base, followed by the United States, in spite of the not too favourable euro/dollar parity, Europe, and finally Latin America"", explained Cyrille Telinge, the President. This international success was gradually established through the building of relationships of mutual trust with customers. ""We have patiently earned a reputation for ourselves and developed our customer portfolio, country by country, by offering only ’Made in France’ quality"". Bioware first built this reputation on the intransigence of its leaders for quality both in terms of products, and of related services. Because if, for cosmetics, French creativity and know-how are recognized the world over, the country’s reputation is somewhat less flattering in terms of customer relations. ""When it comes to full service, what will make the difference is, of course, the quality of developments in labs, but also all the services in connection with the creative process,"" insisted Telinge. ""Our clients come to us because they know that the ’made in France’ label will offer them a number of guarantees in terms of quality and creativity, a plus that will make their marketing approach easier. But the satisfaction survey we conducted recently, showed that they were surprised and delighted by all the experiences they shared with us. They appreciate our customer approach which is both warm and formal from a professional point of view"". And customer attention means a lot when many of these customers are not too familiar with the world of cosmetics and need to be reassured. ""They often are pharmaceutical groups seeking to diversify their activities, or retailers - often specialized chains operating in the pharmaceutical and beauty sector - who want to develop their own brands, or companies from the textile sector and for whom cosmetic products are a logical complement to their clothing lines"". Hence, Bioware offers a set of services based on the multiple know-how of its laboratory, of its design studio and of its manufacturing unit. They range from the simple development of formulas to the creation a range from A to Z, including production and filling. But beyond development, Bioware leaders, who have launched their own brand Novexpert, can pride themselves on being able to monitor the entire marketing chain. The company has even developed a real specialization in export operations and proposes to carry out, on behalf of its customers, all the necessary administrative procedures required for the placing on the market, including if need be, product registration. What is new is that Bioware has decided to make this expertise profitable in a different way by the sharing of it. A unique approach! Under the label ’Novexpert Formation’, the company offers a catalogue of modules covering all the practical issues to which a SME from the sector might be confronted, from the building up of the cosmetics technical file to the monitoring of the outlets or the International prospecting, including the calculation of development costs. ""As part of this training, it is possible for attendees to leave with lists of potential buyers in France or overseas or of journalists from the health and beauty sector. It is a service that we would have dreamed of having when we started,"" emphasised Telinge."
Schwan Cosmetics: a challenging world!,"Premium Beauty News -  As an introduction, what about the company’s activity for this 2011 year, ending in three months time? Joerg Karas - 2011 has been a year of milestones for Schwan-STABILO Cosmetics. On May 27, we celebrated the 10th anniversary of our Czech facility and just a couple of weeks ago on September 16, we celebrated the 15th anniversary of our US facility.  Throughout the year we are participating in many international shows such as FCE Cosmetique in Sao Paulo, Beautyworld Middle East in Dubai, MakeUp in Paris, MakeUp in New York, Beauty Professional in Kazan and Cosmoprof Asia in Hongkong. When it comes to innovative new products, within the eyeliner category, we have to point out our new StyleMatic, a great next step within the automatic pencil category. Premium Beauty News -  Make-up products featuring long-wear characteristics remain a major challenge for the future, don’t you think? Joerg Karas - We live in a fast world. The need for convenience and ease-of-use is getting stronger and stronger. This is especially true for women in the work force. That is why make up not only has to reliably last throughout the day but also through special occasions and formulas have to perform accordingly. We consistently achieve the highest performance with our formulas and as a result gain very happy end consumers. This is the reason why we work on formulas that guarantee an extremely long-lasting wear but at the same time promise a very comfortable application feel. The focus varies of course depending on the product form. Premium Beauty News -  What products are of concern more specifically? Joerg Karas - For instance, with our high performance products, Sharpenable MT and Liquid Liner, we obtain long-wear characteristics of up to 24h with a consistent finish. Our Mechanical product field offers clear USPs for the most diverse demands within colour cosmetics. Modern application systems allow for a multitude of formula and make-up features, from all-day-long to very colour intense. Premium Beauty News -  Does it mean the end of wood- pencils? Joerg Karas -  No, not at all. The wood-clenched pencil, also preferred and loved by makeup artists, will keep its strong standing within the Colour Cosmetics world through the smart usage of new, high-tech ingredients and   application features on an exceptional high level. Premium Beauty News -  International regulatory constraints as well as consumer requirements vary from one country, from one region to another. Not so simple in such conditions to have a product development strategy? Joerg Karas - As a leading manufacturer we are able to know and answer to the multitude of international standards.  Matters of compliance  are treated with high priority as they are an important part of our customer service. Regarding customer requirements, local climate conditions must also be taken in the equation. Hot climate zones with high humidity put very different demands onto the long-lasting wear of a formula than for example the Central European climate zone. In addition, skin type, the geometry of the eye and makeup habits play a very important role. This is where we have our say! Premium Beauty News -  What other challenges must be taken? Joerg Karas -  A very good question: after a 24h claim, what other challenges will there be in terms of long-lasting properties? Be assured, we are already exploring successfully several avenues."
Premium Beauty News.com steadily growing,"Actually, in 2008 the gamble was far from being won. Several Internet sites were already offering on line information for beauty professionals. But from day one, PremiumBeautyNews.com chose to be a completely free information website both in English and French. Most of all, with a wealth of experience behind its creators, the website offered the global cosmetic industry, from ingredient and packaging suppliers to retailers, including converters and brands, a rich content in exclusive information giving also pride of place to iconography. As a result: an impressive increase of the traffic. As of 2009, the monthly audience of the website exceeded 16,000 readers (unique visitors) per month [1], improving its score by over 50% the following year to an average 22,241 readers per month. The growth continued with more than 30% in the first half of 2011 and PremiumBeautyNews.com should approach 30,000 readers per month by the end of the year. The annual number of visits [2] has of course increased in similar proportions 274,632 in 2009 (22,886 visits per month), 407,004 in 2010 (33,917 visits per month) and 488,400 visitors are expected for the whole year 2011 (or 40,700 visits per month). More than 815,000 hits were done in 2010 and this figure should be closer to a million in 2011! As a bilingual website, PremiumBeautyNews.com is obviously very well established in France, a global leader in the cosmetic industry. However, readership is predominantly international, with most of readers coming from Europe and North America."
Strand Cosmetics Europe is strengthening itself,"Premium Beauty News - A few words on this new visual identity... Dominique Bouvier - It is brand new. We unveiled it for the first time at MakeUp in Paris last June. It expresses the company’s DNA, its expertise, its values. In addition to the graphic design itself of Strand Cosmetics, it is underlined by a line consisting of four colours that reflect our culture, that of a company where creativity, innovation and respect for the human are at the heart of our organization. We have also released for the occasion a ""New Look"" palette where these same four colours appear first in the form of a Etain polychrome foundation. A creamy, silky filled texture of blushes to apply with a finger or a brush, featuring subtly iridescent colours that change according to the light. There is also a powder texture of Hybrid Shadow suitable for any kind of fantasy. Applied dry, the powder melts into a soft and silky halo, applied with water, colour then intensifies. Third reference, a red Twinkly Smoothie that adorns lips with an intense and vibrant colour thanks to its soft and creamy texture. Lips are illuminated with bright and luminous colours. Finally, the Gloss Lipofruit Cassis, finely pearled, illuminates lips with a touch of greediness to achieve sparkling and sensual ""zero defects"" lips. Premium Beauty News - A new logo and new image... but also a new approach in terms of management. Dominique Bouvier - Being certified ISO 9001 for ten years and ISO 22716, we decided to look resolutely to the future by committing ourselves even further for the benefit of our customers. Hence, we are adapting our management system with the integration of two new standards, the ISO 14001 standard for the environmental management and the OHSAS 18001 standard for the health and safety management. We intend to influence the collective performances of the company and to stimulate all the creative forces of our teams to imagine, innovative, reasonable and economic solutions, in line with a changing business environment. A truly responsible dynamic, which gives pride of place to the sense of service. It is with this spirit of renewal in mind that our laboratories created a beautiful new collection, ""Secrets Révélés"" with technological formulas imparted with this additional supplement of emotion and the real-life experiences of our creators, with a range of very sensory make-up ""Heures Précieuses"". To note that our entire mascara offer has been enhanced thanks to new packagings which were tested to optimize the formulas effect. Packagings designed in particularly by the German firm Oekametall. Cases, brushes, wipers, vials were optimized for each of our references and their combination with our formulas help reveal all their benefits. Premium Beauty News - Economically speaking, how was this year 2011? Dominique Bouvier - I must say, excellent! We will probably exceed 16 million euros in turnover. A figure to compare with the 14.6 million achieved in 2008, which was a benchmark year for the company. We will have invested some 600,000 euros in our production tool, particularly to increase our fleet of high speed filling machines. Make-up represents the bulk of our business (60%) followed by skin care products. One small downside however, our export share which has decreased. It was of 42% before the crisis of 2009 and it has dropped to 30%. This is the reason why we will increase our presence abroad next year, by being present on professional events of importance, like for instance MakeUp in New York. Premium Beauty News - You have expressed it in your last newsletter. Codes are really changing. Dominique Bouvier - It’s true! At the time of Facebook and Twitter, where transparency is everywhere, we have noticed there was a marked return for secrecy which is cultivated, for intimacy, and elitism. People lock their identity and emotions away to only reveal them to an inner circle. There is a real return to privacy, away from the crowds to enjoy with chosen friends the cosy atmosphere of places unknown to most people. Luxury no longer rimes with ostentation, over-exposure or overbidding, but it has become more discreet and rimes more with experience, expertise, nobility in the choice of ingredients and capitalizing on brands values as well as on the richness of their heritage. In this regard, I must point out, that the new events in which we participated like MakeUp in Paris and MakeUp in New York, which are more targeted, more intimate, friendlier fit perfect in this new trend."
Canadian company Crystal Claire cosmetics takes a stake in Italian firm Kosmoda,"The company of Canadian origin, based in Toronto, Crystal Claire Cosmetics ($130 million in sales) specialized in cosmetic formulation and full service has just taken a minority stake in its Italian colleague Kosmoda (EUR 3 million in turnover) whose production unit is located near Milan in Offanengo. An important step for the latter who will benefit from the industrial and technological potential of its new Canadian partner, who in turn, will take advantage of a launch pad to develop his operations on the old continent. First project in common, the moving in December of Kosmoda in a new 3000 m2 industrial building, always in Offanengo. To note that the two owners, Dario Moretti for Kosmoda and Rogers Hwang for Crystal Claire Cosmetics, also have two similar activities in packaging with Modapack for the first and Crystal International Packaging for the second. Common point in in both cases, a strong expertise in the niche of airless and make-up packaging. Crystal Claire Cosmetics offers a multitude of service levels and manufacturing options, from full turnkey services to basic co-packing services. To be continued..."
Topline Products acquires Cosworld-Primapack,"New Jersey headquartered Topline Products, a leader in innovative cosmetics packaging and turnkey products, has announced the acquisition of Cosworld-Primapack, a fully owned subsidiary of the Cosfibel Group and a major European Cosmetics Packaging Company. The two companies had officialised their discussions on last June. The acquisition creates a platform from which Topline will be able to offer its innovative solutions and full range of services (packaging, filling and assembly, and full turnkey solutions) to a dynamic customer base in Europe. With the European expansion, Topline strengthens its global partnership with some of the world’s leading beauty companies by the added capacity to execute global product launches with specific attention to customers’ regional needs in the European marketplace. The acquisition also gives Topline the flexibility to serve any international customer with either a regional or global strategy, backed by local teams for day-to-day customer support. “This acquisition aligns perfectly with our strategic goals to provide high quality products and services at the regional level to streamline the supply chain and enhance speed to market,” said Charles Chang, Topline president. “Europe is a dynamic marketplace for innovations in beauty and personal care and the acquisition strengthens our position to compete in this market by utilizing Topline’s global manufacturing locations. The acquisition of such an outstanding and customer-focused company as Primapack will give us the opportunity for greater exposure to other new and potential customers.” Known for its innovative, technical packaging designs and dedicated customer service, Cosworld-Primapack has served many major beauty companies throughout Europe. In the deal, Topline acquires all the assets of Cosworld-Primapack including its entire global staff.  Primapack’s current Paris office will be consolidated with Topline’s Paris office which will be moved into a new Paris location later this fall. Jean-Luc Haulet, a professional with more than 20 years experience in the cosmetics industry, will become general manager for the new Topline European organization. He will report directly to Vincent Groccia, chief operating officer at Topline. Mr. Haulet previously was deputy general manager at Cosworld-Primapack."
Terre d’Oc is relying on its outlets to boost its international business,"Terre d’Oc’s first outlet in the U.S., opened its doors early September in New York in the Rockefeller Center on 49th Street in between the prestigious 5th and 6th avenues. A logical step for the French brand of cosmetics and well-being products, after the opening its first store, rue des Abbesses in Paris. ""We are setting foot in the U.S. with a distributor and with a desire to express our concept and values, to give visibility to our brand, before we decide to launch our products in department stores. The opening of a second store is also planned, again in New York"", explains Valérie Roubaud, CEO and co-founder of Terre d’Oc. Like its counterpart in Paris, the outlet in the Rockefeller Center was designed as a showcase for the four product universes of Terre d’Oc - beauty care, make-up, tea, and fragrances - the common thread being the discovery of the world’s beauty and well being rituals.  The brand is also relying on strong values: ecological (in particular with a partnership with SGD and its Infinite Glass), biological (with certified products), ethical (with special attention given to fair-trade for the sourcing of raw materials) and of solidarity (with the financing of aid projects to the poorest). The brand, which in France is exclusively distributed in the stores of Nature et Découverte, is already present in twenty countries, mainly in Europe, with Denmark, Finland, UK, Russia, Sweden and Ukraine. It is now closely focusing on Asia, and its participation last year to the Cosmoprof Asia trade show, allowed the company to make many contacts and get started in Taiwan, with two outlets, and Korea where a store opening is planned late 2011-early 2012. The project of launching the brand in Hong Kong is also well on track. The opening of its own outlets is at the heart of the strategy of international development of Terre d’Oc. ""We seek to open a dozen outlets internationally this year. In addition to the two outlets in New York, the two of Taiwan, and the one planed in Korea, we will also open our own outlets in Mexico and Ukraine. Not to mention, this fall, the opening of two outlets in Portugal, in Lisbon and Porto, the two first in Europe after Paris"", Roubaud announced. And when the brand will be better known, better established and the concept fully finalized, the idea of expanding the network with the launch of franchises is not excluded. For now, Terre d’Oc will attend the next TFWA Tax Free TFWA World Exhibition in Cannes from 18 to 23 September 2011. ""We are not present yet in travel retail. That said, the show will also be welcoming international buyers from other upscale distribution channels"", Roubaud added."
"Heinz Glas, 350 years! And younger than ever...","Premium Beauty News - A fine example of sustainability this anniversary is indeed? Carl-August Heinz - You can say that again! This anniversary really epitomises what our group does and will continue to do as part of its historic mission of responsibility towards its hundreds of dedicated staff members, but also with respect to the hundreds of customers who trust the Group. Premium Beauty News - You have already expressed yourself on this subject through this website, but it is always important to recall that the Heinz Group currently has little in common with the one of former days. Carl-August Heinz - Concerning plastic operations, our presence is constant and, as you know, has accelerated with the acquisition of our colleagues from Böhm, a 30 million euro business, which we have acquired a few days before our festivities took place. Regarding glassware, the shift was operated in 1999, when we decided to specialize mainly on the high-end segment of perfumery and cosmetics to serve, on all continents, increasingly demanding customers. In twelve years, the choice made paid off! May I recall that we currently have no less than five glass factories with two in Germany (Kleintettau and Pilsau), one in Poland (Dzialdowo), one in Peru (Heinz Glas Ferrand) and one in China (""3"" Star Hangzhou Sanxing Craftwork Glass Co. Ltd), with a production capacity of some 1.5 billion bottles and jars with nine furnaces and 32 production lines, not to mention dedicated decoration workshops in Germany, Czech Republic and China and Lima town. The group will post this year, a total turnover of over 300 million euros. Premium Beauty News - The celebration in Kleintettau was also the opportunity to announce a hefty investment! Again, a real challenge in times of crisis? Carl-August Heinz - Yes, quite true! It’s a risk we are taking! This second crisis was predictable and we had taken it into account when we took the decision in December 2010 to invest in a new 60 ton furnace and two new production lines in Kleintettau. But you know, we have been in operation for 350 years and we have had to undergo severe crisis, at least every twenty years. We always managed to recover after each of them. Premium Beauty News - What was the amount of the investment? And what are the other major projects?  Carl-August Heinz - It is important to recall that once the decision was taken, things went very quickly. It took only six months to build the new building and install the new furnace with its two production lines for a total of 20 million euros. And the location for a third line is already prepared which will lead to a final bill of 27 million euros. As for other initiatives, they concern our glass factory in Poland where we have rebuilt a furnace which helped increase production by 20%. We also plan building a second furnace in Peru and a third one in China. Premium Beauty News - The ""plastic activity"" is not far behind? Carl-August Heinz - The takeover of Böhm, which was echoed in your website, is part, of course, of this strategy of growing and also consolidating our plastic activities. Its production potential come in addition to the five production sites we already own on this sector and which generate a turnover of over 60 million euros. Premium Beauty News - You have also announced another particularly original industrial project. Carl-August Heinz - Original, certainly, but nonetheless quite serious and exciting! The idea is simple. A glass factory generates a lot of excess heat - also quite a lot at relatively low temperatures. Why not use it to heat greenhouses and produce in our reputedly cold regions some exotic fruits and vegetables in large quantities to supply our markets and grocery stores? Well, I can tell you that this project will see the light. We are supported by the region and the EU to build a pilot-greenhouse of 3,500 m² that will produce about 10 tons of exotic fruits and 10 tons of tropical fish. The cost of this pilot-operation: five million euros. And if we are successful, other greenhouses will emerge around our other glass factories in Europe."
"Philippe Thuvien, L’Oréal: ""Tap into collective intelligence to create value!""","Premium Beauty News - Moving into your new premises in Saint-Ouen in March 2011, was surely an important moment in the life of the group? Philippe Thuvien - Yes, is was indeed an important moment for our community. Whereas before the Corporate and Operational Packaging services were scattered over several sites, all the Packaging teams for Europe, with the exception of Compatibility and Expertise Laboratories, i.e., 160 people, are gathered together on a single platform fostering at the same time collaborative work. Premium Beauty News - How is the Packaging and Development organized at L’Oréal? Philippe Thuvien - The ""Packaging & Development Community"" is divided into three clusters with a ""Corporate Packaging & Development"" Department, a ""Product Development"" and ""Operational Packaging."" But do bear in mind that it is a global organization, which means it’s also the same operational structure in Europe, North America, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific. Premium Beauty News - What are the main missions of this ""Corporate Packaging & Development"" department? Philippe Thuvien - Our main tasks are to define the group’s packaging policy, to coordinate and manage operational teams, define processes and tools as well as performance management. Not forgetting, of course, internal and external research and development of innovative packagings, technical packaging expertise to support operational teams, the compatibility between the packaging and its formula, and finally the creation of new designs with the help of the Areca Agency. Premium Beauty News - What about the two core activities ""Product Development"" and ""Operational Packaging""? Philippe Thuvien - In direct contact with Marketing, the ""Product Development"" teams serve as an interface between the Business, Operational and R & I. teams. In a prospective and definition phase, they participate with the Marketing teams to the setting up of launch plans. They help marketing teams with the product definition. They study the technical and economic feasibility and propose innovative and environmentally friendly solutions. During the industrialization phase, they develop and monitor the follow-up of schedules and the coordination of all the actors involved in the launch, they elaborate and control the estimated production costs and ensure the development and approval of designs. Finally, they monitor and coordinate the value analysis. As for the ""Operational Packaging "" teams, they are in charge of ensuring the technical design of packaging items, of developing technical plans and pre required specifications for the supplier consultations, of insuring the certification of packagings and finished products and, finally, of elaborating and validating the AC/PF specifications. Premium Beauty News - You insist a lot on the concepts of sharing, of cooperation, and finally of trust that must be established internally and, above all, vis-à-vis your external stakeholders? Philippe Thuvien - Collaborative intelligence is fundamental. It starts with the coordination and management of operational teams and by promoting the sharing of experiences and best practices through the organisation of committees, theme days and ""Trades"" seminars, or even with community sites. This also involves what we call ""the animation of the design quality system."" As for our suppliers, we have developed collaborative innovation, shared conceptions and the delegations of certification. A new approach with one of the highlights being, November next, the organization in collaboration with the Purchasing department, for the second year in a row of the Cherrypack operation, during which selected suppliers will have the opportunity to present  their innovations to the Group. Premium Beauty News - Innovation is obviously at the heart of this dynamics! Philippe Thuvien - Our role is to be both a source of proposals for brands but also to be attentive to their needs. The enhancement of product performance, convenience of use and sensoriality are fundamental driving forces on which we base our innovation strategies while anticipating consumer expectations, regulatory requirements and integrating ambitious eco-design objectives, without forgetting the needs of emerging markets. Premium Beauty News - You also have a duty of expertise? Philippe Thuvien - This packaging expertise is one of L’Oréal assets with the supply of a real support to operational and innovation teams. Packaging expertise also has a mission of value analysis, of regulatory monitoring and of implementing new regulations as well as our Group’s requirements. Premium Beauty News - Design is also an integral part of your approach. Philippe Thuvien - Areca, the design agency brings its contribution to the various activities of the Group and it also works in close cooperation with the Packaging Innovation teams to develop new concepts. Premium Beauty News - Among the ""external"" operations, two have retained attention, the Cherrypack launched last year and, more recently, the First Open Packaging Innovation Challenges in July 2011. Philippe Thuvien - This is indeed part of this spirit of openness and partnership that we want to develop. You have named two but there are others and there will be others in the future. The First Open Packaging Innovation Challenges were launched with three schools: Advancia, a School specialised in business management, ESIEC, a school specialised in packaging engineering and the Strate College, a school specialised in designing. The main highlights which emerged from such an initiative were, to rely on collective intelligence to create value, to promote university-industry rapprochements, and to have innovation focused on the needs of customers and future customers. Each winning idea, being of course rewarded. Premium Beauty News - The next edition of Cherrypack will take place in November? Philippe Thuvien - Indeed, we have decided to renew this positive experience with the Purchasing department. This year, suppliers participating to the operation were selected by a broadened panel comprising members coming from such areas as Purchasing, Packaging and Development, Research and Prospective Marketing. It an opportunity for us to build an exclusive offer to meet the needs of our brands and of consumers."
Fareva continues to expand internationally,"This time it’s a deal! The presence of the group of French origin on the other side of the Atlantic is a reality since several days. An essential step for the firm whose head manager, Bernard Fraisse, had always been clear about, concerning its strategic importance. ""We just had to choose the right opportunity to increase our influence on this continent, he explains, in both the pharmaceutical and cosmetic fields. And this production unit has everything it takes to achieve this thanks to its talented teams and its excellent industrial tool."" The Richmond plant will continue to undertake manufacturing and conditioning operations for Pfizer. This take over for Fareva, is part of a true acceleration in the company’s international development which now operates in ten countries ""and should, in two years time be setting foot in Asia"", reveals Bernard Fraisse! For now, the other major project is located in Brazil where the company started in July 2010 the construction of a factory whose buildings extend over more than two hectares for the filling and packaging of eaux de toilette and aerosols. An investment divided into three tranches which will amount in the end to 42 million euros and will employ between 700 and 800 people. ""The group Avon is an important partner in this operation, emphasises Bernard Fraisse, since we will be able to guarantee him the conditioning of more than 150 million units per year."" To note that the Tubex group is also an important stakeholder with the supply of aerosols and tubes. ""Certainly a perfect platform too, explains Fareva’s CEO, to seize future growth opportunities in the make-up sector of this continent."" A 2011 year also marked for the group with several other industrial investments with for example the commissioning of a second site in Turkey (foaming products and creams), not to mention Russia (foaming products and eaux de toilette) and the start of a second conditioning line for aerosols in Wales."
Kanebo accelerates business expansion in China,"With the aim to strengthen its overseas business, Kanebo Cosmetics is investing heavily in China, the group’s top priority overseas.  The Japanese cosmetics giant, which has already build a strong presence in department stores and high-end pharmacies, is now targeting specialty stores that are developing at a fast pace, including in China’s inland second and third tier cities. According to Kanebo, there are around 200,000 specialty beauty stores in China and they already constitute a major retail channel, in particular in smaller inland cities. In order to tap into this market, the firm will start to sell its products in around five hundred specialty stores in the cities of Sian and Chengdu, and aims to increase this number to around a thousand by the end of 2011. Consistently with this retail strategy, Kanebo is launching Aqua Lunash, a new brand that has been conceived to perfectly fit with the new distribution channel.  Entirely manufactured in China, Aqua Lunash targets women in their twenties, with little or no experience of cosmetic products. Scheduled in September, the initial release of Aqua Lunash features a line of 45 items priced from 12 to 210 Chinese yuan.  “Prices will be set at around the 100 RMB mark so as to make the items readily accessible to young women in this age group,” said the company in a release.  The line mainly focuses on addressing complexion dullness issues, that is one of the main beauty concerns of Chinese women. On this occasion, Kanebo will also introduce new counters that have been designed to match with the needs of specialty stores.  However, the brand will be available in department stores too."
ADA Cosmetics to distribute Aveda products in hotels,"Aveda, the US brand of natural and organic beauty products, which has belonged to the Estée Lauder Companies GmbH since 1997, has chosen the German company ADA Cosmetics International (ADA) to distribute its products in the hotel business. As of September 1, 2011, ADA will distribute Aveda’s body care lines in Europe, Australia and also in Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan. The new partner’s product range includes a multitude of high-end, flower and plant-based skin and body care items for the hotel bathroom, as well as for hotel spa and beauty salon. In order to ensure a prompt delivery of orders, ADA plans to consolidate the stocking of the Aveda merchandise quickly and to establish warehousing in the distribution centers of Kehl (Germany) and Hong Kong. As a manufacturer of hotel cosmetics, ADA enjoys a sales network and a logistics structure that allow the group to supply more than 15,000 customers worldwide, mainly 3- to 5-star hotels. In 2010, the turnover of ADA Cosmetics International amounted to 42 million euros. According to Wilhelm Könning, CEO of the ADA group, Aveda’s products perfectly complement ADA’s own offerings. “This company’s uncompromising and environmentally conscious approach matches our own values and product philosophy very well. Now our selection of ‘green’ lines has become larger. Our clients will really appreciate that”, he said."
MakeUp in New York to host Studio Make Up,"Premium Beauty News - Launching a new make-up brand : what an adventure ! Jacques Cohen - Studio Make Up was launched following repeated requests from a number of retailers who were looking to private label their own make-up products but who had no ideas of what it involved in terms of constraints and commitments (development of formulas and colours, packaging inventories, development of displays, new product developments, promotions, minimum quantity orders per colour, deadlines, etc...). We noticed that these retailers did not have any real experience in packaging development and that they did not have the necessary personnel to follow a program of products development of a make-up brand. So we decided to create a high-end line both in terms of packaging but also and above all, of textures, and we decided to adopt the  product positioning of a ""Professional Make-up Accessible to every women."" Premium Beauty News - In which retail channels?  Jacques Cohen - We started targeting the largest retailers per market regardless of their territory. We offer this brand as an exclusive product to retailers or for them to develop under their own private label on their territory, or in co-branding, while offering them the same benefits they would have with a private label (i.e. only available for them), but without the constraints. The Studio Make Up concept was launched in April-May 2010. It is currently in use, in France, Canada, Central America and Asia. In some countries, because of the variety of retailers, Make Up Studio is sold in all the outlets. We have just started in the United States. We are also discussing with several other countries. Premium Beauty News - You visited MakeUp in Paris and you will be participating, through a make-up animation, to MakeUp in New York. What do you think of this new concept of event? Jacques Cohen - For an exhibitor, the concept which was revealed in Paris is perfect: targeted visitors, the size of the event itself. Therefore all visitors will necessary walk past all the stands. All stands are delivered ready to use. The show focuses exclusively on make-up and the cost of it is affordable. For a visitor, the visit can be done in half a day, it is easy to find one’s way through it, the visitor coming with a precise agenda can make all his appointments and then do all his follow-ups. Of course, there are some points that will need to be improved, but organizers are already aware of that.  I bet New York will be in the same spirit."
Schwan Cosmetics: Always more global!,"Premium Beauty News - Innovation is an integral part of Schwan Cosmetics? Ulrich Griebel - Unquestionably, yes! There are no secret recipes. Innovation is not an option. Even during the 2009 crisis that in the end didn’t impact too hard on us, we haven’t stopped innovating. Especially in the fields of formulations and application formats that really constitute the heart of our business. Sound industrial implementation remains very important of course, and the development of our international teams as well. And we invest heavily in both areas. Premium Beauty News - Your international strategy seems to have gained momentum? Ulrich Griebel - Well, I would be more tempted to say it has consolidated itself. With the acquisition and continuing reorganization of Cosmolab, we intend to build a much stronger partner for the mass market brands in North America and Mexico. In a nutshell, Cosmolab will focus even more on customer service and product development, whereas the Mexican plant will provide a very efficient manufacturing platform. Premium Beauty News - What is the synergy with the unit you own in New Jersey, near New York? Ulrich Griebel - Schwan Cosmetics USA stays independent. It actually doesn’t even operate in the same market segment. It seems like yesterday that we decided to open this plant with just two assembly lines for the production of mechanical eyeliners and lipliners, but 2011 actually marks the 15th anniversary of the company. Meanwhile it has grown significantly, constantly adding more capacity, product and service offerings to its North American customer base. It has actually become the birthplace of many award winning products and is recognized by the entire cosmetics industry as a technologically advanced and innovative partner. A second facility focussing on the production of liquid eyeliners and a comprehensive secondary packaging operation was opened recently in the close neighbourhood. Premium Beauty News - What about Asia? Ulrich Griebel - Clearly, we are strengthening our presence. Our Chinese operation has been a successful first step starting in 2001. But Asia should not be reduced to China only. It’s an extremely dynamic region with many different consumer preferences and markets. We will announce a number of decisions shortly."
BeautyFULL Club: the dynamics of a network,"Since January 2010, it is well over 300 people in total who will have gathered at the Café l’Ecluse near the Place Charles de Gaulle - Etoile around the most various topics ranging from challenges for the preservation of the environment to the impact of new EU regulations including the importance of vocational training. From the outset members of the Club also launched several focus groups, one to reflect on sustainable development and the other, in partnership with several Grandes Ecoles, to reflect on several key strategic themes of the time including the training of young people. During the Club’s General Assembly, which took place last week in Paris, Charles-Emmanuel Gounod, its President, thanked all the members of the Club for their loyalty ""and this despite the tough economic times the entire industry was going through in 2009 where the aim was primarily to resist an unprecedented financial and economic crisis."" ""But precisely it is during times of crisis that the existence of such a Club makes sense."" he added. Not so simple, in fact, to try and escape from the daily pressure of the market in order to try and reflect together for a few hours, but yet so rewarding! Among the key undertakings made at this General Assembly: to keep and develop this breakfast formula that is so successful, to continue to work with quality speakers and to develop the diversity of issues while seeking to organise an annual breakfast on the economic trends of the industry, trends in the world of beauty, of fashion or design and on the evolution of regulations, while keeping an eye on what is happening in other industries. Second axis for the BeautyFULL Club, activate a close and regular partnership with some Grandes Ecoles by giving them a number of strategic studies that can only serve the entire industry.  “The main partner schools, explained Philippe de Brugière, Vice President, are ESCP, Ecole Boule, ESIEC of Reims, the ENSCI of Paris and the Ecole Centrale de Paris.” And nothing exist nowadays without a attractive website! ""This is almost achieved,” announced Daniel Saclier, Vice President of the Club. A structured website with both an open space for all visitors (online membership applications, a summary of the Club’s activities and some material on the Club’s participations) and a section for members (members’ personal profiles, a directory, a full presentation of the Club’s Breakfasts, advanced research for onsite information, downloads and access to photos and videos). ""Of course, recalled Charles-Emmanuel Gounod, such a club can only exist because of the commitment of each of its member to keep it going and make it grow. It is necessary that each of us relays the club’s actions, is actively involved in the development of ideas and participates to the debate that they will surely generate."" A network concept where some European countries are performing better than others. ""Well, precisely, we should pick out the good ideas and good dynamics where we can find them! ""  The goal being for 2012, to reach 70 to 80 members! ""Of course, insisted Charles-Emmanuel Gounod, an increase in the number of members can only be the fruit of quality meetings, debates of ideas and the value added brought to the entire industry."""
Ileos acquires Brazil’s Mappel,"The agreement, which was announced today, to take a majority stake in Mappel, should reinforce the leadership of Ileos in the manufacture of unit-doses and samples for the cosmetics industry through Bioplan, the subsidiary managed by Ludovic Anceau.. Established in 1970 by Marion Appel, the Mappel company is specializing in the manufacture and filling of unit-doses and samples.  Brazilian market leader in its field, the company has 230 employees on two production sites in Sao Paolo.  According to Ileos, Mappel posted a turnover of 25 million euros in 2010, with strong continued growth. Managed by Philippe Gelblat, Ileos currently employs 4000 people in 14 locations in Europe, the United States and China. In 2010, the group recorded a turnover of 275 million euros. After this integration, Ileos “will achieve a turnover of 300 million euros, thus confirming its position as global leader in packaging for the beauty and the healthcare industries,” said the company in release. This operation will also allow the group to expand its international influence in a geographical area with huge potential. This acquisition fits with the strategy implemented for several years now by the Ileos’ management, which aims to support its key customers through the strengthening of the group’s its position in high growth areas. ""Mappel offers us the opportunity to develop our know-how and serve our customers in Brazil which has such great potential,” commented Philippe Gelblat, President of Ileos, adding that Marion Appel would continue to lead the company. For its part, the President of Mappel sees in this partnership a “significant potential for Innovation and Industrial synergies""."
Cofatech: now targeting make-up,"For this SME specialized in uni-dose samples, which was created by Dominique Lourel, its current CEO, one of the main strategic keys remains constant adaptation to market needs and customers. ""With a strong focus on product innovation and a true complicity with the market and our customers,"" she quickly adds. Innovation, is a watchword in Loudun (western France), where are established Cofatech’s headquarters and main production centre.  Latest innovations launched in recent months include the ""Walipack"" for the Clarins Fragrance Group, which was the sample selected for the launch of Aura by Swarovski (two samples in one), or the eco refill for Flower by Kenzo, inspired from the Lingobig (the berlingot with a cap), not to mention the now famous concept of the dose in the form of a berlingot who received an ""Oscar de l’emballage"" in 2001 and we all know the success it encountered. ""This is clearly our second nature"", explains Lourel. ""Innovation is an integral part of our vision of the market. It is often the result of an ongoing and desired dialogue with our customers. And also I insist on the fact that it is a true mindset which is inherent to every employee of Cofatech. As a matter of fact, all this gone through road and the growth achieved by the company would not have been possible without their support."" The core markets of the Cofatech firm include skincare products followed by hair products and, more recently, alcohol products, especially perfumes for which a new dedicated workshop was created in 2010. An operation that was part of a broader reorganization and rationalization of production whose overall cost will have exceeded 400,000 euros. ""As for make-up, emphasises Lourel, our presence at the MakeUp in Paris show reflects perfectly our desire to invest more thoroughly this segment, in which we were of course already operating but still relatively discreetly. Especially since this market is increasingly moving towards the notion of full-service, and that we are clearly among the best placed in France to provide such a service."""
LR Health & Beauty Systems still growing,"Premium Beauty News - What was the outcome of last year for LR Health & Beauty Systems? Dr. Jens Abend - We achieved a turnover (net sales) of about 230 million euros during the past fiscal year 2010. That means an increase of about 11% compared to 2009. Additionally, 90 new jobs were created. Besides the continuous development of our strong domestic market, Germany, which remains our main focus, we are also expanding abroad. Thus, with more than 50%, international markets make a major contribution to our positive overall development. The extraordinary strong commitment of our numerous sales partners and our optimized marketing concept, with an incentive bonus system, are key factors in this repeated success story. Premium Beauty News - What were you most successful launches in 2010? Tilo Plöger - In 2010, decorative cosmetics ranked among our most successful markets, recording a 131 percent growth compared to the previous year - mainly through the re-launch and the establishment of the Colours and Deluxe brands. In the fragrances market, our core portfolio of celebrity products has been remarkably growing.  The Bruce Willis brand is our best selling fragrance and was the most successful product launch in the whole history of LR. Regarding our personal care products branch, our core brand “Aloe Vera” was updated and improved with new formulations and a clear and modern packaging design. This was very well accepted from our distribution partners and our customers. In addition, LR was nominated for the “Blach Report Event Award 2011”, and within the category “Lifestyle, Men” the “Bruce Willis” scent has found its way into the final selection of “Duftstars 2011”, the perfume award of the Fragrance Foundation Germany. Premium Beauty News - And for 2011? Tilo Plöger - In 2011 we are investing around 5 million euros into our headquarters in Germany, including financial resources for research, development and production. Premium Beauty News - The French market was one of your priorities last year. Tilo Plöger - In France, cosmetics and personal care products rank among the best selling product markets. Since years, our sales have remained on an impressively positive trend, with two-digit growth rates, and the full potential isn’t tapped yet. Looking at 2011 and 2012 there is room for more. For example in the  market of pet nutrition. Furthermore, in autumn LR will launch its own jewelry collection in France. Premium Beauty News - LR Health & Beauty Systems operates in 32 countries worldwide. What about your international development? Dr. Jens Abend - Besides Germany, Greece, the Czech Republic, France and Italy, for example, are countries with a strong market development. In June 2011 we will start distribution operations of our “Aloe Vera” brand, and our fragrances and cosmetics in Russia, a very promising market.  Then we will also launch dietary supplements in this country. Premium Beauty News - How does LR address sustainability issues? Tilo Plöger - For LR sustainability is a very important theme. For example let’s talk about aloe vera.  Landowners have to guarantee that they haven’t used any kinds of chemicals on their aloe vera cultivation area for at least three years. That’s the reason why most of the aloe vera growers let themselves certify by institutes like QAI (Quality Assurance International). At an international level the Aloe Science Council (IASC) awards its seal of approval if strong criteria for cultivation, harvesting, processing, regular checks and high quality are fulfilled. In Germany, SGS Institut Fresenius tests our aloe vera drinking gels, controls batches and compliance to hygiene regulations. Annually, LR is extensively tested and checked in several terms of quality aspects by IASC and the SGS Institut Fresenius. Premium Beauty News - What are your next expectations for LR? Dr. Jens Abend - In 2011 we expect further growth. Several distributional and sales highlights will play a part in contributing to the increase, like the market entry in Russia, the planned launch of pet food supplements and the launch of jewelry. With these new business activities, we open up new consumer target groups and sales channels - milestones for a sustainable distribution success."
"Topline and Cosworld-Primapack, to reach an agreement","This is a coherent operation for Topline who already weighs some USD100 million in sales, employs 2,000 people, runs five factories in China and who has spared no efforts during the last two years to also enter the American and European markets. ""A presence all the more logical, as had explained Charles Chang to Premium Beauty News, last year,  since Topline’s customers are located in every corner of the word and that Europe remains the largest Beauty market in the world. The opening of European customers to full-service made in China   reinforced our decision to take that step. In addition, we have a unique expertise in the cosmetic sector as it covers both filling and packaging operations."" As of the 80s the firm was among the first to work with Asian partners for cosmetic packaging. In the mid-1990s, it is also one of the pioneers to have introduced Made in China full-service in the USA. Then in a few years time, Topline developed an efficient industrial tool. By 1995, the firm opened its first factory in Shanghai, now specialized in metal processing and who manufactures, among others products, the very popular eyelash curlers marketed worldwide by Maybeline, Cover and Max Factor, not to mention make-up cases... Three years later, in 1998, the group integrated the manufacture of cosmetic products, which now makes it possible to produce a whole range of make-up products. In 2000, a new production unit was set up, this time dedicated to plastic injection, which now currently hosts no fewer than 150 presses, not to mention all the finishing equipment to manufacture indifferently, compacts, closures, jars, lipstick tubes lipgloss etc. In 2002 a third unit was created, this time dedicated to brushes, applicators and powder puffs. Finally in July 2010, the company announced the construction of a plant in Mexico and the acquisition of a plastic injection factory, Motor City Plastics in Dundee, Michigan, whose main strong point is bi-injection, and even tri-injection. To note that Topline Products has been recognized four years in a row (2006-2009) one of New Jersey’s 50 most performing companies. As for Primapack, Cosfibel’s entity, it has performed remarkably well in 2010 with a turnover exceeding 21 million euros. With a trading activity that almost doubled in four years. An increase which is due both to a greater penetration among traditional customers and to gaining new customers under the company’s core target which is make-up, but also and above all, thanks to the conquest of new markets in the areas of personal care and other sectors such as spirits (especially Brandy). To note that Primapack relies on three offices in China, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong to ensure, sourcing, operations, the development and monitoring of supplies and quality control.   Main fields of expertise, metal and plastic injection, multi-materials, decorations and various surface treatments, stamping, galvanizing and electroplating. Concerning the latest novelties to date in the beauty sector,the complete make-up line for Burberry, the skincare line for Kenzoki, of Kenzo Parfums, Guerlain’s mini lipstick, and a lipstick By Terry."
Full service: The irresistible rise of bomo-trendline,"""It’s truly the full-service activity that has, in recent years, taken over the company’s business, particularly during the last two years"", explained Adolf B. Brodscholl, Managing Director. ""To such a point that near Brno we had to build a dedicated plant in the Czech Republic, that employs about 150 people. An integrated plant that can perform plastic injection and assembly."" As for the range of filled or non-filled products, it is broad, and ranges from eye/lipliners, nail-care pens, mascaras, including lip gloss without forgetting one of bomo-trendline’s flagship production: Spacy Art & French Free Ink System Nail Care Products.  ""But we also offer a comprehensive range of standard packaging for skin-care,"" emphasised Brodscholl. Industrially speaking, the group currently owns some 96 injection machines (injection and blow injection) located for most of them in Germany at Schramberg Tennenbronn and eleven in the Czech Republic since last year. bomo-trendline manufactures its own tooling and has different filling & assembly machines. Its customer base is still very much German, to 75%, but it also includes Spanish, French, Italian, British and USA clients. But it is also in the field of product innovation that bomo-trendline has done particularly well in recent years with the development as of 2009, of a series of filled capillary Pens intended for nail care products such as the Soft Cuticle, the Perfect Corrector, the Iron Hardener and the Cuticle Remover Gel the latter taking the form of a tube.  ""It was a big hit"", admits Brodscholl. “So much so that we currently produce some millions of them.” This mastery in the manufacture of special applications has naturally encouraged engineers to develop their first, recently rolled out, perfume applicator, the Perfume Pen for man and woman. ""In fact, our business is divided into five core activities,"" explains Brodscholl.  “Standard packaging for the skin care market, standard packaging for the make-up industry, a full-service activity, especially in the nail care professional segment but also for special make-up products for eyes, lips – face. The segment of comprehensive Full Service products and our ability to develop our own packaging and product design and concepts to serve our customers."" But undoubtedly the full-service activity remains and will remain the German group’s powerhouse for the next coming years."

Faber-Castell: A colourful anniversary!,"Premium Beauty News - This is a historic year for the entire Faber-Castell group. An anniversary occurring at a time when the performances seem to be outstanding? Stefano Castelletti - In the traditionally low first 5 months of the current business year 2010/11, all regions succeeded in recording double-digit sales growth. Europe/North America improved due in particular to the good start in Germany, Italy and the USA by +15% (currency adjusted by +14%), and Latin America and Asia/Pacific grew in each case by +37% (currency adjusted by +14%). In the field of competence Premium, it appears that in particular the crisis-related reluctance of consumers to buy luxury products is declining, resulting to date in significant growth of +24%. The “Playing and Learning” field of competence was able to record similarly positive trends. With an increase of +26% compared with the prior year period, the product range for children of three years and older once again proved to be an important pillar of the global marketing. The worldwide cosmetics business also developed encouragingly with growth of +26%. The company continues to see great growth potential especially in Asia, and will also concentrate in future on the development of the “Playing and Learning” and “Premium” (high quality writing implements and accessories for demanding consumers) fields of competence. Our board chairman, Count A.W. Faber-Castell forecasts that we will achieve sales of EUR 500 million in the current business year, naturally accompanied by a further improvement in our profitability.  He also likes to repeat a maxim that will continue to apply for the successful accomplishment of the next decade: “We want to do ordinary things extraordinarily well.” Premium Beauty News - What does the ""cosmetic"" activity currently account for in the Group’s activities? Stefano Castelletti - The Faber-Castell company was founded in 1761 and from the mid-19th century developed into the world’s premier manufacturer of wood-cased pencils, both graphite and colour. In 1978 the company extended its range and transferred its know-how from the field of wood-cased pencils to a new line of business: colour cosmetics. Today Faber-Castell Cosmetics is one of the leading private-label cosmetic manufacturers for the international beauty industry. Still family-owned in the 8th generation, this year marks the 250th anniversary of Faber-Castell. By now, the production of cosmetic products has earned a dominating share within the manufacturing facilities in the Faber-Castell group. The objective is to become the second pillar for the Faber-Castell group world-wide, contributing a representative share to the consolidated benefit and becoming the premier global supplier of cosmetic pencils, liquid systems and nail care applications. Premium Beauty News - You will be celebrating history and therefore past years... As for the future, what is your insight? Especially concerning the cosmetic segment. Stefano Castelletti - The cosmetic market offers a good growth potential for new and existing products as well as markets. We will continuously adapt our strategies and organisation to make best use of the growth opportunities. Premium Beauty News - The cosmetic pencil is constantly evolving, with many. innovations. At the same time, it is increasingly challenged by other kind of applicators. What makes you confident in the development of Faber-Castell Cosmetics in the course of the next ten years? Stefano Castelletti - With Faber-Castell’s background, assets and specialisations we are confident to continue developing and offering technologies, services and products. Like a lipstick, the pencil itself established as classic standard product for every make-up range. Even though, this does not mean that it cannot be enhanced in every aspect from development, production and decoration technology – what we constantly do. And when we look at future make-up trends and new techniques we see many benefits in pencil type application."
"Dieter Bakic Enterprises, always unique!","The German company is successful, in spite of a competitive environment that has not weakened, far from it, and which can take many forms, in terms of competitors, in some of the packaging segment, such as large international packaging companies, dealers, design firms and new players in  the ""global full service"" including filling operations. The latest advertising spot, on the French TV, of a famous brand of German cars gives quite a good picture of the image one could have of Germany...  ""What a fine style, what a fine design,"" exclaimed Karl Lagerfeld adding ""indeed this car looks quite French!""   The embarrassment in the studio was perceptible until when a technician came whispering at the ear of the fashion designer that the car... was German! An anecdote that could just as well illustrate the road gone through by the teams of Dieter Bakic Enterprises in the beauty segment.  Because the Munich based firm held tight to all the values for which the company is known for today in this sector, not only in terms of design, innovation and creativity, but also in terms of efficiency in a sector long regarded as ""very French"". ""The analysis of a market, of a company, of its products, of the selected distribution channel... a number of elements that contribute to lead our client toward the appropriate solution in terms of packaging,"" Dominic Bakic explained. ""But There is more to it!  We always try to have a global appreciation of the subject and we want to work in the field of the development of a complete range. In addition, we fully participate in the chances our client takes."" Today, Dieter Bakic Enterprises, employs 80 people in five countries, who are working for 95% of them in the cosmetic sector. A company that owns more than 500 moulds and creates, year in and year out, fifteen new products. Truly a company of its own that has no equivalent elsewhere.   ""It’s true,"" said Dominic Bakic, ""that there are some companies that we consider our competitors, however, they actually only offer part of our services. Hardly anybody to my knowledge, can boast having such a broad offer ranging from market analysis and brand positioning, to the manufacture of packaging, including the innovation, and the design phase ending with the creation of a coherent range also producing high values."" For the teams of Dieter Bakic Enterprises, a retail shelf space in stores look most often confused and with a lack of ’landmarks’. ""Even if we are stating the obvious"" Dominic Bakic insists ""obviously we need to stand out and still be consistent across all brand elements! Which is not that simple ... What matters is of course to be visible, innovative and consistent!"" And the latest examples of putting into compliance a product line are numerous. ""I can cite, for example, Dr. Baumann, a German company where it was not just about repacking an existing line, but consulting and realising a brand repositioning to a more selective brand, spanning all communication elements.” As for environment in the literal sense, which is one of the market’s oh-so-legitimate concern, teams at Dieter Bakic Enterprises have integrated it perfectly. ""We are about to introduce a new concept with that in mind!"" To be followed..."
Full service in cosmetics : Langguth’s sound choices,"And, besides which, ""you can’t beat the view on the countryside!"" Since actually, Langguth moved two years ago in the small industrial area of Steinach in the Bavarian countryside halfway between Nuremberg and Munich. A fine, brand new and very modern unit hosting both administrative and production premises which are fully overlooking the countryside thanks to tens of meters of huge window bays. Inside, some sixty people work in different workshops dedicated to the production and filling of nail polish for the first one (40% of the activity), to the manufacture and packaging of lipstick for the second one (the second biggest activity), to the filling of mascara, lip gloss and also of loose and pressed powders for the last one. ""In fact we are capable of taking care of everything,"" explains Martin Mader, the CEO. ""We can provide a complete service from formulation to filling including packaging development, packaging procurement and the production of bulk.” The company can rely on fifteen production lines including three for nail polish, two for lipstick and five for mascara and lip gloss. Latest investment to date, a fully automated machine for the filling of nail polish. “What our customers appreciate,"" Martin Mader emphasises, “is our flexibility and our ability to process orders beginning at 2,000 and up to more than 100,000 pieces (with one team)."" Mainly focusing on the German domestic market, the company also operates on the Russian market but to date... not directly on the French market!! To be continued."
Florida: A new plant for Oxygen at the end of the year!,"Cost of the investment, over USD 25 million. A decision that will enable this company founded only ten years ago   to dramatically step up its production capacity at once. ""Quite clearly with this new infrastructure,"" explains Philippe Cohen, the owner of the company, ""and given the number of new machines dedicated to production, filling and packaging, that we will be installing, our goal is at least to quadruple our capacity over the next coming years."" Main reason for the exponential progression of Oxygen in ten years? ""It’s quite logical,"" Philippe Cohen emphasises, ""we proved that we were able to supply the biggest U.S. cosmetics brands not only in due time but also in terms of quality products. And even though we decided two years ago, to build a production unit in the Dominican Republic, we continued to invest in the US territory which was experiencing a depletion of its production tool. Everyone knows that nature hates emptiness. We were there to fill-in the gaps."" By visiting the two current production centres whose areas put together do not exceed 10,000 sqm, one’s opinion is quickly made. The current premises are obviously not large enough to host some 400 people that operate machines for the production of bulk and the ones for the manufacturing of powders, lipsticks and lipglosses. And the new 21,000 sqm plant that will see the moving-in, at the start of the Christmas holidays, of both, the whole current production tool and the administrative offices, will be a real breath of fresh air...for Oxygen. ""Make-up still accounts for more than 80% of our business,"" points out Cohen, ""but skin care and hair care activities are also on the rise."" Oxygen’s main asset is its research and creation potential combined with a true will for excellence. ""We are very much attached to this,"" we were told at the headquarters. ""This is clearly what makes the difference compared to some of our colleagues who only have a filling activity... So much so that sometimes we refuse a order if we don’t feel we control the whole subject or if we have the feeling it was insufficiently studied."" Second asset of the company, its production potential and its wide scope of technical expertise. In the course of the last two years, investments in production equipment have never stopped at Deerfield Beach. Latest to date, the commissioning of two automatic production machines for lipsticks on silicone moulds. As for the R&D laboratory, it comprises more than 28 persons.  ""There aren’t that many companies around that are capable of providing such levels of traceability and of microbiology tests,"" insists Cohen. ""Our plants are also approved by major U.S. and European companies."" The management explains that ""the main asset lies in the fact that we are able to produce, thanks to the flexibility of our production tool, bulk ranging from quantities of 5 kilos to 500 kilos. The decision taken to produce in the Dominican Republic was a form of response to Asian competitors. We were maybe a bit more expensive but the cost difference is decreasing every month!"" Approximately one third of Oxyen’s production is currently exported. ""Indirect export but also direct export,"" we were told at Pompano Beach. And this is probably only the beginning of it... Because the production capacity of the new plant can only but offer the management new challenges and new horizons. To be continued..."
Geka’s dynamics,"At the factory and headquarters of Bechhofen, an hour from Nuremberg (Germany), Geka’s teams are in full swing. In two months to the day, the new unit dedicated to full service will be about to start in a brand new building of 650 sqm. An operation achieved in the context of a strong progression of sales, which totalled more than 100 million euros in 2010, compared to 93 millions in 2009. The euphoria seems to be the same across the Atlantic in Elgin where, only two years after the putting into service of the group’s U.S. plant, the production exceeded 70 million units last year, entirely dedicated to the local American market. As a result, managers are still picking up the pace and have just decided on a 10 million euros investment plan for the twelve months to come. Main objective, increase the production capacity in mascaras in both Germany and the United States, but also reinforce the company’s choice of full service integration and also extend, next year, the company’s activities in lacquering and metallization, first in Germany and then in the United States. “On top of that, we intend at the same time, to put more efforts into consultancy services.  Our aim is to deliver a value-adding service to our customers by offering them all tests (application, stability, compatibility, etc.), and the documentation and evaluations needed during the development process of a product.  On the other hand Geka has a profound experience when it comes to the delivery system and applicator of a product. The important step is to bring everything together: packaging + applicator + formulation. This will enable us to provide perfectly matched products that fulfill our customers’ request,” explains Franco Luca, Geka’s CEO. The service approach is also high on the R&D department of the German firm who recovered at the same time the mascara patents from the Beiersdorf group upon an agreement that was reached in just a few weeks. ""It’s obviously very important,"" points out Franco Luca, “because as a matter of fact, we are currently the company that owns the most patents in the world in the field of mascara manufacturing technologies.  However, in addition to specific developments, we are also in the process of re-launching Geka’s range of standard products with the objective that it quickly accounts for a good third of our offer."" Demand for customised standards is there! The creation of the limited edition by the designer Harald Glööckler, which includes lip gloss, mascara, eyeliner, lipstick and even a nail polish, is a proof of this. “The fully finished collection was extremely well received on the market and shortly after launching sold out. Our capabilities in terms of decoration enable us of course to give free rein to our imagination."" As for the traditional fibre-made brush segment... ""Expect a few surprises in the coming months with the introduction of a new generation of brushes thanks to a new technology,"" Franco Luca revealed, ""because, again, we haven’t had our final say, especially since this market will eventually account for at least 40% of our business."" Finally, the satisfaction is also high for the full service diversification operated by the company. ""Our customers are responding very positively.  And even before installing the necessary equipment, we have already started the filling operations for our first customer.”"
Aircos introduces its new 2012 Spring/Summer line,"Premium Beauty News - These three ranges are based on themes like air, earth, fire, light... Éric Merville - Absolutely! ’Natural Odyssey’ (air and earth), natural, warm and earthy, illustrates a commitment towards simplicity and goes straight to the gist of things. As for airy organic and eco-certifiable textures for eye-shadows and free blushes and the light gloss cream, they must accompany us on our journey to a poetic world. ’Techni-Color’ (fire and light) belongs to the world of light and vibrant colours. Two new ranges of glosses (bottles and jars), filled blushes with a cream-to-powder finish, and a ’Terre de soleil’ (compact powder) with an SPF 15 will enhance your summer make-up! ’Aqua-Morphose’ (water and metal) is inspired by the underwater world. This range unveils on chromatic waves and vibrations, with totally surprising and shifting eyeshadows and gloss textures with stunning special effects. For the eyes, ’Powder & Cream’, an exclusive Aircos texture, an ultra-soft and silky compact powder, enriched with moisturizing pearl powders, comes, on the one hand in six marine eyeshadows, with a wave-like effect, or in duet formats. And six more rounded and innovative polychrome eyeshadows, ’Aqua-Morphose’, imparted with a touch of elegant glitter, were formulated using more than 50% of ""magic"" nacres: 3 or 4 shades clearly stand out on the eyelid, depending of the light orientation (from a shallow angle or from above) and also depending of the natural roundness of the eyelids. Impossible to visualize on a set picture, only eyelids can speak for themselves! In addition, we have already finalized our next 2012/13 fall-winter collection, for a world first presentation, at the MakeUp In Paris trade show on 23 and 24 June (at the Carrousel du Louvre). Premium Beauty News - You have also strengthen your R&D structure as well as your Full Service activity? Éric Merville - Yes, we have strengthened our R&D department, which will be headed by Nicolas Lieurey, who will control, among others, innovation in the domain of powders, filled products and technical processes using two laboratories (formulation and industrial implementation) with a staff that has actually doubled in two years time. Throughout its make-up collections (2 per year), Aircos already formulates its powder compacted eyeshadows with 50 to 60% of nacres and non-tacky shiny glosses. A technical innovation is being finalized for a premiere presentation in a few weeks. Don’t forget that, thanks to our two formulation laboratories and our two specialized sites, we are able to offer comprehensive and specific make-up solutions... From the creation of packs and formulas including the development and production stages, our teams are capable of managing a entire make-up line. This solution, which over-simplifies the whole supply chain, reduces the development time, is surely a cost effective solution with the elimination of all intermediary costs to offer an original and innovative ’made in France’ product. By providing complete products with a reduced carbon footprint (the two plants being located within 50km from one another), we are developing our business following a resolutely eco-friendly approach. Premium Beauty News - One of your slogans emphasizes on the fact you are a business partner with a strong industrial bias! Can you tell us more? Éric Merville - Let me give you an overview of what we can offer. In our factory of Romorantin dedicated to make-up, we manufacture and package all kinds of bulks for colour cosmetics (except nail polish). This site which has been granted the following certifications ISO 9001 (2008), cGMP, GMP and OTC (ECOCERT under approval), offers significant production capacities: – 150 tonnes of powder/year.
– 60 million of compacted cups/year.
– Filling (lipstick): 15 million units/year.
– Hot filling (gloss & mascara): 10 million units/year.
– Packaging in total: approx 75 million units/year. The industrialization team adapts man-operated flexible lines, but more particularly designs and develops dedicated multi-function, in-house automated lines. Currently, five fully automated lines are running to process simple cups, multi-product cups, with or without accessories, along the various packaging stages, however complex they may be: code marking, batch numbers, labelling, bonding, shrink wrapping (sleeving), cellophane wrapping, filming, etc. For filled products, we also have several equipments: – 1 cosmatic machine with flexible moulds (multi-size grapes with or without engraving).
– 1 Weckerle machine (retail format lipstick with a 12 mm mechanism).
– 3 filling rotary lines (cups, small size lipsticks with no mechanism or with a 9 mm mechanism, picking).
– 1 filling line (gloss & mascara). Finally, we are equipped with a GMP compliant OTC area that can fulfil all customer requirements: from production to final packaging. This new facility dedicated to make-up products with SPF claims will enable customers to develop, with Aircos, their products to serve U.S., Canadian, Australian or Chinese markets..."
Sun Creative Cosmetics: The goal is achieved!,"If you remember: a year ago, almost to the day, the German company headquartered in Nuremberg, Schmidt & Niedermeier, specialized in the production of lipstick tubes, which was in receivership, had finally found a entity to take over its activities. The new owner was the Rusi Cosmetic GmbH group based in Bechhofen. Main objective in 2010 for the buyer, to reach EUR 3 million in sales with a workforce reduced to 30 people. Which was actually achieved! And prospects for 2011 promise to be even brighter, especially in terms of profitability. A company which has come a long way, it is the least one can say! ""Yes it’s true,"" admits Omar Rizk, the Commercial Director of Rusi Cosmetics, “it was far from being a sure bet! But Mr. Klaus Sindel, Rusi’s CEO,   and his team held tight!"" First step, inject cash, 600,000 euros in total, to invest in both the renovation of half of the standard moulds owned by the firm (and decide to abandon the other half switching from 150 to 75 moulds!), but also in the installation of four new electric injection machines including the revamping of the lacquering and decoration facilities, and finally, in the detailed analysis, at a technical and commercial level, of the strengths and weaknesses in the company’s range of lipstick tubes. ""Which will quickly become the springboard, explains Omar Rizk, from which we could resume soundly the business activity."" Quite a long, painstaking job that took several months but which eventually paid off! ""What is also important to note, is that large customers renewed their confidence by placing orders. And we even won some very important projects. It is true that our ability to deliver quantities ranging from 50,000 to 500,000 pieces is appealing, the whole of it as part of a total annual capacity that exceeds ten million units!"" insists Elke Kaiser, the new commercial director of Sun Creative Cosmetics whose appointment has been effective since January 1st, 2011. Another of Sun Creative Cosmetics assets, is its combined mastery of metal and plastic parts. ""We are not that many in Europe, explains Omar Rizk, to be able to offer this dual expertise in the domain of lipstick tubes. And the ‘100% made in Asia’ is a concept that is ageing fast... Good for us!"" Especially since the company also offers some innovative products such as this lipstick tube made of completely biodegradable material... Germany remains the largest customer of Sun Creative Cosmetics but France is not far behind. And the company’s ambitions are huge. Since the 1st of January 2011, the firm has hired a new agent in the person of Patricia Vahé Goddard, from the PH Beauté Company."
Ancorotti Cosmetics: A world leader in mascara in two years time!,"It is now official! Ancorotti Cosmetics has just acquired a new 1,000 sqm building just in front of its current production unit located in Crema, an hour away from Milan. The aim of the operation being to relocate the storage of products and to dispose of a new production area in the prospect of extending the scope of production in other areas of colour cosmetics than that of mascara... For the time being the young Italian company has to cope with its development on its favourite segment, mascara, and now, foundation. With 900,000 euros in turnover in 2009 and,... 11 million expected this year(!), the progression of the company is, to say the least, continuing at a rapid pace. ""It was the right move"" emphasises Renato Ancorotti. ""The latest figures on the current demand for mascara worldwide speak for themselves. According to the latest Italian official statistics, the global market is estimated at two billion euros with nearly 800 million for Europe. It alone accounts for more than 50% of cosmetic eye products and for more than 14% of the make-up segment overall. From the production side, of course, a significant part is what we call ‘captive’, that is to say, produced in house by a number of brands but the remaining part, i.e. the one that is left accessible for companies like ours, can be estimated between 260 and 345 million euros."" As for the foundation segment, its prospects are equally interesting. It could represent globally, still relying on the latest Italian statistics, some 2.3 billion euros. ""The development prospects are therefore quite real,"" emphasises Renato Ancorotti. ""Not to mention the fact that it’s our second flagship product!"" Today the Italian firm is able to produce some 3 tons/day of material (foundation + make-up + some lip gloss) at a filling capacity of over 100,000 pieces with one single team. ""But the production capacity is not enough,"" he insists.  ""We must of course be able to offer quality and innovative formulas, the whole of it with the required flexibility to meet small orders as much as larger ones.”  In a word, ""not seeking to become the largest company but the best!”"
De Bruyère signs make-up license agreement for Lulu Castagnette,"For De Bruyère, a start-up created in 2009 for the development and marketing of licensed cosmetic lines, good news seem to come one after another. After the success of the first Lollipops Make Up collection and the welcome around the Summer 2011 collection, it is the signing of a licensing agreement to develop a cosmetic line under the Lulu Castagnette brand name that rejoices today both Charlotte Catton (a former executive of Parfums Guerlain and of SGD) and Marie Puech, managers of the company. Since its inception, De Bruyère has assigned itself with the mission to transcribe in the cosmetics universe the DNA of brands seeking to diversify their activities into complementary areas to that of their original market. ""Many brands are looking for partners to help them develop their businesses in other distribution channels, but they don’t want to lose their soul and are very attentive to quality"", Charlotte Catton explained. Thus, De Bruyère has developed and marketed two lines of private label make-up products for distributors, and launched last year, the Lollipops Make Up line, now on the shelves of more than 150 outlets in France (Lollipops outlets, Douglas, Beauty Success and Trupheme networks), in Italy (Marionnaud), in Portugal (Douglas), in Morocco and shortly in Spain, Russia and Australia. ""Our added value for small projects stands in our ability to manage the entire process, from development to commercial distribution, including production, regulations, POS advertising, marketing consulting, ...""  De Bruyère selects and coordinates the work of the different players involved with the aim to promote European quality.  ""For instance, the Lollipops Make Up line is entirely made in France or in Italy"", emphasised Catton. Among privileged partners of the firm, HCP, Chromavis and Fareva for product and packaging development and La Vache Noire for the design. ""I must admit I was pleasantly surprised by the commitment of all the suppliers involved in the development of the first Lollipops Make Up collection, when it only concerned at the time very small volumes."" A situation very favourable to emerging brands which, according to Charlotte Catton, is quite specific to the make-up segment. ""In order to stimulate their brands, even market leaders resort to ephemeral collections resulting in one-shots for suppliers, who have managed to adapt to such production requirements. I also believe that, to counter competition from Asian suppliers, the strong point of European companies lies in their responsiveness,"" she added. In the immediate future, a third collection is underway for Lollipops Make Up. For this brand alone, De Bruyère expects a turnover of 500,000 euros in 2011. As for the Lulu Castagnette line, it will be launched in 2012 with in focus, an initial turnover of 200,000 euros. The business plan was set up with a forecast growth of 400,000 euros in 2013 and 1 million in 2014. Next objective for Charlotte Catton, ""a partnership with a designer’s brand for the development of a prestige line, complementary to our other brands."""

Fox-Krawczyk - The beauty business has changed radically in the last 10 years and Genealogy is consistently working to progress to meet these needs.

We all know that each contract filler has its own core competencies in manufacturing. We formulate all of our client’s products at our own laboratory, thus owning the formulas, insuring quality raw materials are used in them and keeping our clients out of lengthy R & D queues at conventional fillers. This process also insures formula exclusivities for designated periods of time for our clients. They then travel to the contract filler that we have selected, to scale up the production and to insure the compliance to all our quality requirements. Our strategic bulk manufacturing and filling partners are Nuworld Beauty, Bradford Soap Works Inc. et Innoteq Inc."
Estelle & Thild: the Scandinavian brand that goes international,"The history of Estelle & Thild began when Pernilla Rönnberg started to look for organic skincare products suitable for her two young daughters, Estelle and Mathilde.  The difficulty to find what she expected led her to create her own line. The company was founded in 2007 and the overwhelming demand forEstelle & Thild’s original children’s products quickly led to the launch of a complete skin and body care line for adults.  “We have 33 SKUs, and will launch 3 more in August.  We continuously work on product development,” explains Pernilla. Ecocert certifies both Estelle & Thild products and manufacturing process, but being certified is just a basic requirement for a natural cosmetics line, it does not really help to stand out from the mass.  “For Estelle & Thild as for many other upcoming eco beauty brands, the main challenge is to build brand awareness,” says Pernilla. To reach her goal, Pernilla Rönnberg mainly relies on a strong brand concept, and then on partnerships with distributors.  “We have had a great success in terms of getting the best distribution channels and shelf space. We work closely with our retailers and do joint marketing.” Pernilla Rönnberg is convinced that consumers of organic and natural cosmetics have new expectations.  “I believe that for the most part natural skin care has moved beyond the promise of purity and safety. Instead products must offer something more than these basic benefits. I believe that the new dynamics need to look closely at promises and performance and innovation backed up with originality, design and exploration. I am convinced that a part of our success is that we have combined the organic content with a fresh design and concept.” Actually, the natural and organic cosmetic customers have transformed very fast and now demand much more than mere natural or organic formulas.  “They want fresh modern alternatives that combine performance, originality and design together with a genuine organic approach.” The Estelle & Thild product range consists of three lines: baby & child, body care and skin care.  Currently, the products are distributed in Scandinavia (Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark).  In particular, they are available at Kicks - the leading Nordic cosmetic chain - and in selected children’s and interior design stores. There are plans for further expansion in Europe and in Asia and the company got a lot of attention and contacts from its participation in Cosmoprof this year.  “Our focus markets are Germany, UK, Italy, France.  However, we are very selective in our choice of distribution channels and only go with those which are most suitable for our brand,” says Pernilla Rönnberg. The most coveted retailers in Europe would be interested in the brand, which should therefore be available in more countries soon."
Fiabila: heavy investments worldwide,"Premium Beauty News - It seems an exceptionally dynamic market implies massive industrial responses? Pierre Miasnik - It’s a fact! The global nail polish market is particularly profitable. For our part we recorded very strong growth in 2010 and prospects look even brighter this year. The challenge, in Fiabila’s case, obviously consists in coping with this increase in demand by ramping up the production capacity of our various sites but in a controlled manner and without compromising on the quality of our products. As this increased demand is global, actually all our sites are concerned. Primarily those located in the outskirts of Paris at Maintenon, Plaisir and soon in Le Perray-en-Yvelines. Premium Beauty News - Expansion plans in France are already underway. What do they include? Pierre Miasnik - Some are already achieved, others will be completed by the end of the year! To meet demand, we of course invested in some new equipment for mixing and tinting, the goal being to double the number of batches produced. In parallel, we also strengthened our laboratory, accelerated the training of our staff dedicated to production and increased the monitoring capabilities so that the quality level always remains faultless. Incidentally, our delivery times are back to normal, on average around four weeks while not so long ago they were closer to four months. But there is more to it. We are currently doubling the production of thixotropic bases, which will allow us to work with different formulas and better respond to requests for customization. Finally, the highly automated industrial processes that we have developed in the United States are about to be transferred to our unit in Maintenon, which will enable us to further improve the competitiveness of some of our products while securing even more the production process, particularly on a environmental, but also human level with less intervention. Finally, we have just filed a building permit for the piece of land we acquired next to the Maintenon site.  It is clear that this plant is purely and simply, going to double in size over the next few months. Premium Beauty News - The demand for packaged products has also grown strongly! Pierre Miasnik - That’s right! And, again, it was essential to meet the demand. We started by increasing the number of teams on the lines of our unit in Plaisir, while focusing specially on productivity with the arrival of a person coming from the automotive subcontracting and very much aware of automation processes. But mostly we decided to acquire a second production unit of 4,300m² in Le Perray-en-Yvelines who already had the advantage of having a ""Seveso"" classification and which will be operational June next. This will enable us to double our packaging capacity. Premium Beauty News - The United States form the second main target for your investments! Pierre Miasnik - Don’t forget that we settled there eight years ago. Our factory is based in New Jersey and employs about fifty people. There too the demand was particularly strong. So we decided to acquire a plot of land to build a new 5,000 m² factory which will in the end allow us to triple the current capacity. I must add that we are also setting up a new grinding equipment for gels, the same as in Maintenon, to both optimize the quality and increase the production capacity. Premium Beauty News - Third line of investments, India! Pierre Miasnik - And not the least! Same pattern, too! We have been operating in this area for twelve years. The current unit needed to comply with international standards. Late June, a new 3,500 m² unit will be operational. The objective being to actually produced in India with the same standards as in Europe, taking into account, of course, the specific constraints pertaining to the region both in terms of climate and people. Premium Beauty News - The same catchword for all three of them: Quality! Pierre Miasnik - This is indisputable! We are asked higher and higher purity levels. We have implemented even more accurate monitoring tools. Our staff is continuously, trained on new materials and new techniques. We regularly select new materials and new suppliers. Technically speaking, we are relentlessly working to comply with the new European cosmetics regulation due to come into force in July 2013. We are very mindful about the purity of our raw materials and we are still working on the development of new polymers. We have just filed a patent on a brand new product that imparts the nail polish with a better water resistance. Not to mention the new ""gel"" formulas that polymerize under UVs but which are less allergenic than existing products. Premium Beauty News - You have become the masters of colour! Miasnik Peter - In a way, yes!  Nail polish is colour! We roll out twice a year 72 trendy shades. We have computerized a portfolio of more than 160,000 of them!"
Asia: L’Oréal’s long-term commitment,"Premium Beauty News - So, in retrospect, are you pleased with this very first attempt, last November in Hong Kong? Jacques Sebban - You surely mean ... delighted! Not only vis-à-vis our suppliers and partners but also because of the internal mobilization it generated throughout the group. And this at all levels, be it the Purchasing, Quality, Packaging or Logistics departments. This great ""Supplier Day"" allowed each of these stakeholders to play their part. This had a huge mobilizing effect on us. As for the suppliers who were present in Hong Kong, unanimously I think, they were, both pleasantly surprised by the desire for rapprochement and sharing that we showed throughout the meeting, but also very proactive in their exchanges with us. Besides, it was with them that we set up this event largely based on their wishes. Premium Beauty News - So you will renew the experience! Jacques Sebban - Yes, of course! This ""Supplier Day"" will take place every two years, with alternately, a sort of ""Suppliers Convention"" where topics will be discussed more in depth, why not in the form of round tables. Asia being quite a vast area, these conventions will certainly be held in the North and the South. The next ones should therefore take place in Shanghai and Singapore. Since this major first in Hong Kong last November, we have had a lot of feed-back from several of our departments but also from our suppliers. The Quality department, in particular, is always very much looking forward to such meetings. Not to mention the teams in charge of the Supply Chain and of Environmental issues. Premium Beauty News -  In Hong Kong all your suppliers were not present! Jacques Sebban - That’s right! We have more than 800 of them located in the Asian area, which as you remember, also includes India and Japan.  And we had invited only 180 of them in Hong Kong. But it was a first. And we could obviously not host all of them. In fact, this is also an important point of our approach with them. We wanted the Hong Kong meeting to be an expression of that. Our business relationships should be strengthen and also closer to our mutual concerns. We want to work with confidence and insure that our relationship is in the long term. Convey clear and accurate messages. It is also with this in mind that I created a ""Supplier Relationship Management."" We want to provide our suppliers with more information.   The message is clear: ""we say what we do and we do what we say!"" On our side, we have worked to have more experienced, better organized and increasingly professional teams. The cross-cutting nature of our experiences is also important to fully appreciate each sector with its specificities and to intensify our exchanges. At the same time, it is clear that we want to reduce our supplier base. Simply because it seems sounder to build a relationship that would include more consistent challenges and volumes with a stronger commitment coming from both sides. Premium Beauty News - A Win-win situation? Jacques Sebban - Yes, exactly! You know the winner of last year’s Supplier Day in Hong Kong, the Beauty Star company, was invited to come to Europe, to the headquarters of L’Oréal group, to meet all the managers. I must add that I feel it is very important to be aware of all the challenges that lie ahead. As you know our group has an ambitious investment program set up for Asia in the coming years. We are doubling the production area in India, we are quadrupling the surface in Indonesia, we are studying a new industrial establishment in China etc. Not to mention increasing the performance of our industrial equipments. The message to our suppliers is simple. It’s a question of getting better organized to perform better. For them too, the future looks bright through the volumes that we will be providing them."
"“I focus first on the product’s formulation and I want a rational packaging,” Dany Sanz, Make Up For Ever","Premium Beauty News - Economically, how did the year 2010 go for Make Up For Ever? Dany Sanz - 2010 went very well, it’s no secret, everybody knows it. Our efforts have paid off. Our global results were also very good. The year 2011 is looking pretty good too, we have boosted some circuits, in particular the United States with the opening of a ""shop in the shop"" in Sephora outlets. We also plan to revamp our store in New York and to open more stores under our own name, in Los Angeles for example. Premium Beauty News - The main piece of information for Make Up For Ever today is the opening of its first general public store in the Marais, in the central area of Paris... Dany Sanz - And for Paris there are two main news. First, the renovation of our historic store on Rue La Boétie, which will be revamped this summer. The upper floor of the store will allow us to expand our sales area and our training rooms. Then there is the opening this exclusive Make Up For Ever store at 5 rue des Francs-Bourgeois. Premium Beauty News - It is a very ""make-up street"" where are located MAC or Bobbi Brown to name a few... Dany Sanz - It is indeed a neighbourhood of make-up artists. It’s great to find ourselves among brands who are like us, that we respect and who have their own aficionados. It is also challenging to be among them. Premium Beauty News - This store, you said, that it would be intended for the ""General Public"".  What difference do you make between a Pro store and General Public store? Dany Sanz - 5, Rue La Boétie will again become the genuine pro store it used to be at the outset.  Everything happens at La Boétie, it is the cradle of Make Up For Ever with the store, my office, the laboratory, the training rooms... As you know, at the outset of Make Up For Ever, all our customers were in the trade. The general public wasn’t even aware of the existence of the store! We were only working with professionals, whether make-up artists, of course, but also dancers, actors, artists...  The general public has access to Make Up For Ever products in Sephora outlets, but customers also like to come to the store where they can find all the references. Rue des Francs-Bourgeois will be their dedicated spot, it will the store for our addicted customers. Premium Beauty News - Do you have plans to expand the network of exclusive stores (whether pro or general public) in France or abroad? Dany Sanz - Yes, in Saint-Tropez this summer. This store will be ephemeral since it will be open late spring and will welcome holiday makers from Saint-Tropez and its surroundings during summertime. Premium Beauty News - As regard products: the HD range has recently enriched itself with many new shades. Is it comprehensive now? Dany Sanz - No, it is not and never will be. This range is unlimited. Make-up artists working with HD cameras need specific products at all levels. In 2009, I started by proposing the HD foundation which seemed to me as being the most important product for make-up artists and also a highly specific one to design. The HD line rapidly expanded to include a number of new references: base, powder, we then worked on blushes and concealers. Currently, all our efforts are focused on developing new textures for the complexion. A new foundation is in the laboratory, it is a creamy product, with a richer texture, intended for dry skins. I am also currently working both on extending the shades of the HD loose powders and on our future HD compact powders. Next will come all the colour cosmetics for eyes and lips. Premium Beauty News - You recently launched the campaign ""HD unretouched,"" a campaign that makes Make Up For Ever the first cosmetic brand in the world to present unretouched visuals.  Are you in favour of digital retouching?  Does retouching enhance the work or the make-up artist? Dany Sanz - I think touch ups are essential in comparison to what consumers, media and brands expect from an image being part of an advertising and commercial approach. The image mustbe challenging and unretouched, it is impossible to achieve a strong enough visual to make it recognizable among a thousand other pictures. But ""No Retouch"" must be considered compared to HD cameras because it is more difficult to retouch a film than an image. We wanted to prove that it was no longer necessary to work on the image in any way, to touch up the make-up.   Our ""No Retouch"" campaign began with the making of a film.  A bailiff was present during all the film stages to testify on the absence of retouching. Premium Beauty News - Concerning the new Aqua Liner range, it is predominantly iridescent. Why did you initially chose iridescent finishes? Consequently have you also planned some matt versions? Dany Sanz - Within the Aqua Liner range, there are nonetheless three matte versions. To my dismay, consumer demand abroad goes for iridescent. They all want iridescent products! Amidst these pearlescent, I still propose essential shades in matte and iridescent. But be reassured concerning this Aqua range, I’m working on non-iridescent Aqua Cream products, they will be available in 2012. In 2012 we will also present our non-iridescent watercolour blushes. However, trend for the most part is to an iridescent finish and we are forced to meet demand. Premium Beauty News - In 2009, you were excited about the development of specific products for the stage. Is this project still under consideration? Dany Sanz - ""Of course!"" A year ago we launched the Up Light, which is my first work on light. The subject of light fascinates me more and more. I am currently working on new blushes and a new foundation that will be specifically light-reflecting. I am actually planning, late 2012 and early 2013, to exclusively focus on stage products. Premium Beauty News - You’re very interested in packaging. Will you launch new products associated to specific packaging? Dany Sanz - I reckon innovations related to packaging are not too exciting, I find it difficult to point out at any real innovation. We are currently in an ecological trend not being quite sure of what to choose, should we go for plastic, paper, cardboard? Premium Beauty News - What do you think of the featureism in packaging such as vibrating, rotating or heating mascaras? Dany Sanz - I want things that work. I focus first on the product’s formulation and I want a rational, resistant pack that will last in time by respect to the consumer. I would feel more attracted by new materials but, unfortunately, there aren’t any for the time being. Right now, I am very interested in cardboard packs: I find some cardboards extremely resistant, just as much as plastic is! I find this cardboard beautiful and different, a noble and enjoyable material. I’m getting closely involved in the subject as we’re on the point of redesigning completely the whole range of Make Up For Ever with some totally new packs. 1600 references, no less! Tools, put aside, still remain 1000 references to place in boxes!  We are also going to rework the design of our brushes."
Cosnova Beauty towards new retail concepts and globalization,"Premium Beauty News - What was the outcome of the year 2010 for your business? Javier González - In 2009, Cosnova’s growth rate reached 26%.  It was an outstanding result in a year of a recession. Looking back at 2010, one’s can only say it has been even more impressive. With net sales of 133.3 million euros in 2010, the previous year’s annual results have been surpassed by 46%. We had great results with our two brands: Essence and Catrice.  Our whole portfolio has grown in a fantastic way.  Essence reached a 23.7% market share in volume in Germany in 2010.  Nearly one out of four pieces in the German market altogether are from Essence by now.  The historical market leader Maybelline Jade is at 15.8 %. However, in value Maybelline Jade remains the leading brand in Germany with a 23.1% market share while Essence ranked third with 9.7% (AC Nielsen), very close to the second brand, L’Oreal, with 10.0% value share. Premium Beauty News - What were your most successful launches in 2010? Petra Schönegger - Our colour category, which consists of many products, grew very strongly.  Actually, each year we launch a total of new products reaching up to 50% of all our SKUs. One very successful product launch for Essence was the Studio Nails line, which is a kind of sub-category within the nail-art segment. It consists of stickers in different patterns and designs that can be easily stuck on the nails to get a professional studio quality just in a minute, at home and much cheaper. In 2010, one of our big projects was also the complete relaunch of the Catrice brand, with a high quality approach, new packaging and a selective range of products representing our high competency in the colour segment.  Around 65% of the assortment was substituted and we expect to finish the whole relaunch within a few weeks. Premium Beauty News - And what about product innovations in 2011? Petra Schönegger - Essence is launching My Skin, a new skin care line dedicated to young skin needing moisture and intensive care. The My Skin line (9 SKUs in total) consists of cleansing and caring products, as well as special items such as moisturizing masks. The My Skin products will be on counters from the middle of March 2011. Another innovation, Better Than Gel Nails, will be launched in 2011.  It’s the second launch within our Studio Nails line. Using a special kind of nail polish Better Than Gel Nails gives a French manicure gel-look up to 10 days without the disadvantages of real gel nails from a studio for example. It’s very easy and healthier for the nails because there’s no need to even or treat the nail surface and to use a UV lamp, it can be applied at home and quickly removed with our remover. Other new decorative cosmetics are on the way: new mascaras, new gel eyeliners and new lip glosses. In the context of the Catrice relaunch we will also bring onto the market series of new blushers, powders, mascaras, etc. Premium Beauty News - Are there new investment plans and/or developments relating to processes? Javier González - We have invested - and will invest further on - several million euros on display stands (our model is called “Beauty Shop”) designed for the point of sales.  We have upgraded all the Essence display stands last year in Germany and other German-speaking countries and the results were so satisfactory that we are rolling out this new displays world-wide by the end of 2011. And in the course of the Catrice relaunch we will also launch a new “Beauty Shop” in Europe in 2011. Premium Beauty News - Last year Cosnova has established its first retail shop in Offenbach. What is the outcome of this test? Javier González - Besides the prominent presentation of our “normal” cosmetics assortment, this shop serves as a creative laboratory for Essence.  It also offers fashion accessories (fashion jewellery, scarfs, sunglasses, etc.) as well as so-called fan-articles (paper blocks, cups, pens, etc.). The Offenbach shop has been a beautiful window and source of inspiration for our company. For example, it helped us to successfully launch Essence and Catrice at Douglas with excellent results. We are looking at a couple of further developments. One of our new ideas is to have an outlet at a high-traffic place in a big German city. Ye, in 2011 we will try some new ideas on the retailing front! Premium Beauty News - Cosnova has gone live with Ulta and H-E-B in the U.S., and with the South-African retailer Clicks. Javier González - We are extremely happy with both countries. Ulta was the perfect retailer to get started in the U.S. where there is a strict separation between mass and prestige retailers.  Ulta is inventing something in-between, a bit along the line of Müller in Germany. We are continuing to grow our sales at Ulta and H-E-B, and Ulta will test to double our display space in 2011.  We are launching at a third retailer, Fred Meyer, in May 2011. We have also tested last year at Shoppers Drug Mart in Canada, and we will be launching nationally in July. Shoppers Drug Mart is the largest and the dominating retailer in the Canadian market with roughly 1,000 outlets across the country. Clicks was also a great retailer to start with in South-Africa because of its dominant and prominent role in the market. We have launched in most of the points of sale last year and we are rolling out the last 100 outlets this year. We believe after that roll-out we are going to be the number two brand after Revlon in value market shares. For both markets (North America and South Africa), we have created several SKUs targeting black and Latino skin types. A real highlight for us was Italy. Early 2010 we launched at Oviesse, a clothing retailer also owning the department store chains Coin and UPIM.  We launched in the three formats in 2010 with truly impressive results. Compared to 2009 we quintupled, our sales in Italy last year. It was eye-opening to see a distribution channel like clothing retailing, which was not a focus channel for us, offering such a tremendous potential. Premium Beauty News - What is the current status of Cosnova’s expansion plans in the Middle East? Javier González - By now we launched in eight countries in the Middle East (4 in 2010). Looking at the political situation in the last couple of weeks, we do not expect any negative long-term implications; some countries might open up more to international trade, which could offer future opportunities. In the short term, there could be logistic disruptions, but we are monitoring the situation in close contact with our distributors, and for the time being everything is continuing as planned. We have just launched in Egypt and Yemen, two countries that have been affected by the current political changes, without any significant disruptions so far. Premium Beauty News - What are your expectations for 2011? Javier González - Once again, we expect a double-digit growth. We intend to remain a fast-growing company for the years to come and we see many opportunities waiting for us, geographically speaking but also from the brand point of view."
The Body Shop shares expectations with suppliers,"From costs efficiency to value creation through quality, time-to-market, innovations and eco friendly/natural products, there was hardly any taboos at The Body Shop’s Suppliers Day, which was organised by the company’s Operations Team last month in the UK. The event gathered 35 existing or potential suppliers involved in trade sourcing (finished goods, packaging and accessories) from Europe, Asia and North America.  The objective was to strengthen relationships and to engage suppliers with the company’s strategy as well as with its vision and values. Philippe Reale, Director of Operations, opened the day around the theme ‘Lets build the future together’ with many references on key factors from the past about end-to-end process (from raw/pack materials until products in hands’ consumers). This event allowed The Body Shop teams to re-emphasis its individuality and uniqueness in business, and reinstates the strategic role of its suppliers around the brand’s five pillars: Against Animal Testing, Support Community Fair Trade, Activate Self Esteem, Defend Human Rights and Protect Our Planet. Moreover, The Body Shop team shared challenges and expectations to ensure that brand’s sourcing strategy will be the fuel for business growth and a competitive advantage with few best in class suppliers being established for strategic technologies/products. Jerome Courtaigne, Director of Sourcing, concluded the day on a positive tone “The day was very successful with a lot of inputs coming from both sides, a strong engagement of our suppliers and very clear expectations about the ways to improve our business relationship.” With more than 2,500 stores in over 60 markets, The Body Shop is the leading natural and ethical beauty brand worldwide."
Farevacolor: 13 million euros of pure creation in three years time,"Premium Beauty News - Actually, Farevacolor is a very young business! Anne Challe - Yes, Absolutely! And these days, it’s worth noting! The creation of Farevacolor only dates back to three years. In 2007, the Group Fareva took over a factory located in Savigny le Temple, formerly owned by Beiersdorf. The goal was to develop a subcontracting and full-service activity in make-up. The cosmetic market itself (skincare + make-up) represented 42%, out of the EUR 830 million achieved in turnover by the Fareva Group last year.  The sub-contracting and full service activity in make-up accounted for EUR 13 million in sales. Premium Beauty News - 2008 and 2009 were obviously not the best years to start a business! Anne Challe - Yes, and we had to hold fast! But soon enough we had the confirmation that the creation of an entity like Farevacolor was suiting needs of both the French and European market, with a service offer ranging from simple outsourcing to real full service, not only industrially speaking but also in terms of R&D and creativity. Our offer is comprehensive with our catalogue of standard products in the segments of foundations, powders, lipsticks, lip glosses, mascaras, etc. Pencils being so far, the only segment where we are not operating. Because our ""innovation"" unit, is very active it enables us to offer each year several thematic collections with the assistance of our make-up artist, Isabelle Pain. Premium Beauty News - Many investments in people and equipments! Anne Challe - From the outset and all technologies included, the group provided itself with first rate equipments. Since then the pace has not slowed down and we invest as and when our clients’ needs evolve to be at the best required level in all cosmetic segments (foundations, powders, lipsticks, lip glosses, mascaras). If the unit in Savigny le Temple is equipped with highly automated lines it also has dedicated workshops in small areas to produce small and medium size series. The teams of the Fareva Color entity includes about forty people working in five departments: Marketing, R&D Laboratory, Packaging procurement, Sales and Projects.  All of them are specialists in their field, dynamic, motivated and competent! Regarding production, it is undertaken by the factory with some staff dedicated to cosmetics. Premium Beauty News - Innovation that requires original packaging solutions? Anne Challe - Yes of course, and this both through our partnerships with packaging professionals, but also through our synergies with the Fareva Group. You surely understand that I can’t tell much more but it is clear that the group’s expertise in the segment of aerosols is a card that will come into play appropriately. Let me remind you also that Farevacolor manages autonomously its packaging needs. The main objective being to develop the full service activity. 
But we are not just focusing on packaging. We are also constantly reinforcing our skills in the organic sector. Premium Beauty News - What is your objective in terms of turnover for the two years to come? Anne Challe - Between 25 and 30 million euros in 2012!"
Eye makeup is key to Arcancil’s rebirth,"The challenge was worth taking up. When in 2008, Anne Delleur, 32 and a former Marketing manager at L’Oréal, joins the Institute Caméane and the young team who acquired the Arcancil Paris brand in 2006, she already knows that she has in her hands the destiny of a little-known jewel. Founded in 1935, Arcancil is one of the oldest French brands specialized in make-up. Over the years it had built itself a strong reputation, but a victim of the financial difficulties of the Laboratoires Valdor, its former owner, it disappeared from the shelves in 2005. When Arcancil is back in perfumery outlets in the late 2007 it has to start from scratch again. ""It’s the relationship with distributors that suffered the most,"" explained Delleur. ""Even before the cessation of business of the the Laboratoires Valdor, successive stock-outs, a lack of timely supply had led to the delisting of the brand by its key customers in France."" In November 2007, the team of the Institute Caméane pulls off a coup with the launch of Kohl Kajal, a kohl in a stick presented in a matte black case and embellished with black satin ribbon. The product is immediately acclaimed epitomizing at the same time the brand’s rebirth. With Kohl Kajal, Arcancil Paris managed to create a new make-up gesture in line with a strong eye trend, very popular in France and abroad, that of smoky eyes. ""Arcancil has always been a very much eye make-up-oriented brand, with a strong token of recognition in the segment. Therefore it’s quite naturally with this product category, and particularly with the kohl that we proceeded to the relaunch of the brand."" Another one of Arcancil Paris strong point is the use of high intensity pigments. An obvious choice for the Cabaret range, that offers eight perfectly coordinated harmonies [1], with shades that do not fade, even on eyelashes and darker skin tones. ""That’s probably why this range is also so popular among black and mestizo customers"", explained Delleur. ""We are launching new shades to suit all women whatever their skin complexion and also taking account of skin and climate specificities, in order to innovate with make-up formulas necessarily meeting specific needs. With its covering power, our foundation, Matitude, enables to perfectly unify the skin complexion even under extreme heat and humidity conditions."" The potential of these ranges of shades designed to meet the most diverse expectations is all the more important since Arcancil Paris has a high quality image at an affordable price. In parallel with these innovations, Arcancil has kept offering historic products that have helped built the brand’s success: Compact Mascara, bottled eyeliner, as well as all the customers favourite shades. For Arcancil it is a winning return. ""Since the relaunch of the brand we have never reported any loss. For the three past years, our growth rate has always exceeded 30%. On the last half of the year we are still on a 35% trend."" This success, the brand also owes it to the loyalty of its customers and its awareness. The priority for Anne Delleur is now to consolidate the distribution network in France and abroad. Today, the Arcancil Paris products are distributed exclusively in France at the Galeries Lafayette and through the outlets that had backed up the brand’s come back on the market. Among them, the Institut Inaya, the specialist in ethnic products from Saint-Denis. ""Our partnership with Galeries Lafayette is very satisfying and allows us to be present in 70 stores, and we also sell on the Internet. But our objective in the end, is to find a partnership that would allow us to be present in cities of less than 100,000 inhabitants. Our objective is to regain Arcancil’s previous level of distribution which was of 500 to 1000 outlets."" An ambitious goal, but up to the expectations of the brand’s potential that currently ranks fourth in Galeries Lafayette sales. An ambition also driven by a real presence on the ground and the ability to meet the expectations of distributors. ""Our success is also due to our ability to provide an optimized inventory management of the brand to the outlets. To control appropriately the supply chain also means guaranteeing faultless inventory management in each of the brand’s point of sales and a perfect quality of service for customers."" The ambition is the same overseas, representing approximately 65% of sales. The brand is already present in twenty countries where it often enjoys very strong awareness, especially in South America, North Africa, the Middle East, and of course Europe. The Arcancil Paris brand is no longer distributed in Asia, but its participation, early November 2010, to Cosmoprof Asia in Hong Kong has helped establish very promissing contacts in the three countries where the brand was operating before, namely Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea. In Brazil, Arcancil Paris is distributed in a dozen cities with the help an commercial agent. In this country as in other countries, the brand did not hesitate to develop specific ranges, suiting skin complexions and specific consumer needs. ""Knowing how to meet the exact needs of customers is one of our key assets,"" emphasised Delleur. ""In Europe, for example, most women are looking for a natural make-up result, which led to the success of the Nude. This is fare from being the case in many countries in the Middle East where bright colours and covering textures are in great demand. We must therefore adapt ourselves and we can afford to, because we are make-up experts."" Paradoxically, this gave Arcancil Paris a chance to emerge reinforced from this period. The relaunch of the brand to new distributors also involved the obligation to attract new consumers. ""We focused our efforts on recruiting young consumers of 30 to 45 years of age who had an knowledge of the brand through their mothers.""Again, eye make-up products (eyeliners, mascara,...) were at the heart of the reconquest strategy. They were updated for this target and Kohl Kajal was the brand driver. But the demand, from former customers always loyal to the brand, has remained strong. It is the distance selling activity implemented to meet there demand that made it possible to maintain a link with those of our customers who no longer could rely on a distributor. These are precisely the customers that Arcancil now wants to win back."
Eastman: “the cosmetics market is a priority”,"Premium Beauty News - What does Eastman represent today in the world of packaging for the cosmetics industry? Valérie Bouvignies - Eastman’s plastic fibers and materials are key products our customers rely on to make products people use every day. Headquartered in Kingsport, Tennessee, USA, Eastman had 2009 sales of US$5 billion and has approximately 10,000 staff worldwide. On the plastic side, Eastman used to be the leader in the area of polyester chemistry and has recently refocused on specialty plastics, which include both copolyesters and cellulosics. Copolyesters whose main features combine aesthetic (transparency and thickness) and mechanical properties and excellent chemical resistance have a natural fit in the cosmetics and personal care (CPC) segment and are known under the brand name The Glass Polymer. The Glass Polymer includes a larger family of grades that can be used in Injection moulding, extrusion blow moulding and injection stretch blow moulding. Common applications are jars, caps, perfume caps, bottles. The Glass polymer is available on CPC sub-segments like skin and body care, fragrances, and colour cosmetics. The CPC segment is one of the priority markets for Eastman. The team is active all along the value chain where we strive to meet market needs, in particular with the introduction of new grades. Premium Beauty News - What were your main achievements in product developments in 2010? Valérie Bouvignies - Talking about new developments,Eastman launched a new grade in 2010, the CN. This grade is dedicated to injection moulding and specially developed for cosmetic needs. It is a new generation of PCTA, which complements the existing range with significant breakthroughs. It has a high level of clarity, a very neutral colour. It enables to run extremely thick parts with minimum thin marks, and no crystallization nor blush at gate with as always the same mechanical and chemical resistance properties copolyesters are famous for. Its easy processing also makes it very attractive for processors and represents a major change in comparison with traditional copolyesters. In a nut shell we could say, this grade has the best of copolyesters properties in a single resin. Premium Beauty News -  You have implemented a specific strategy for the make-up industry with the help of an American designer. Valérie Bouvignies - The fact of having a brand and a brand image which are recognized in the continuity requires to have it evolve continuously. To achieve this, Eastman, chose to stage the CN market launch and to enhance this innovation through the design of packaging concepts. Eastman initiated the partnership with the designer Marc Rosen in 2009. Marc first worked on jars concepts and then in 2010 presented the"" the Art of clarity ""through 18 packaging concepts for the make-up segment. The concepts designed by Marc Rosen became reality thanks to the commitment and motivation of partner transformers who participated in creating them. Among those manufacturers are Leidel Corporation (USA), Pieriplast (Peru), Axilone (China), Plasmetik (China), Jackel (Hong kong) and Albea (Brazil). Premium Beauty News - Does your group intend to invest more in this sector? Valérie Bouvignies - The CPC is a fast moving  market on which we permanently invest in. They may relate to specific innovations in the cosmetics market or concern more global issues, such as reducing the environmental impact. Premium Beauty News - What are the main strategic regions for Eastman in the world. Does France still represent an exception? Valérie Bouvignies - Asia and emerging regions like Latin America are obviously strategic on the CPC segment. However, Europe still remains a strategic region as a primary spot for innovation and we mustt not forget that perfume and its legendary luxury brands are always associated to France"
The new ambitions of Alkos Group,"Premium Beauty News -Why did you choose Alkos Group? Florence Lefeuvre - I love comebacks! But it’s the human dimension of the adventure that motivated my choice; Gérard Gieux and Dominique Vautier had no trouble in convincing me of the exciting character of this new post which suits perfectly my experience. In addition, Intercosmétiques and Sagal [1] are known for their industrial expertise, and their levels of services. So far, these companies have remained relatively discreet about their performances, I will do my best to communicate to the marketplace the image they deserve and enhance their product offering. I wanted to rediscover the thrills of exiting challenges by integrating a business plan with a comprehensive function in which I could develop my gifts by fully dedicating myself to the progress of teams and of the activity. Contribute to the development of the only ""Made in France"" pencils is a prospect that I find very exciting. I am going to rediscover a new factory and will do my best with the teams in place and newcomers, to help the company reach the place that it deserves on the market in France and overseas. Premium Beauty News - Your experience in make-up, skincare, and pencils was a strong asset to tackle this new challenge. Florence Lefeuvre - Let’s say I have acquired a real expertise in the assessment of textures and that I learned to develop an active listening on the needs our clients brands, helping me therefore to meet their expectations. Premium Beauty News - Did the recent appointment of Dominique Vautier (former Manager of Chanel’s plant in Chamant) at the head of the group influence your decision? Florence Lefeuvre - Indeed, I met Dominique Vautier whose reputation of professionalism and industry expertise I already knew about. We actually share the same development vision for the group. Our backgrounds and respective profiles are perfectly complementary. The significant work he has already achieved at an industrial level, especially for the beautiful pencil plant in Boulogne-sur-Mer, will soon bear fruit. Premium Beauty News - What is the importance of pencils in the market of colour cosmetics? Florence Lefeuvre - It’s a product that has developed itself significantly. Its appeals obvious to both, the consumer (they are the most affordable of make-up products) and to brands, they are very profitable references with high rotations, specially on the lip axis."" Premium Beauty News - And what are the goals of Mr. Gérard Gieux, the Group’s main shareholder? Florence Lefeuvre - Gérard Gieux is recognized in the industry for his innovations in the packaging company Cosmogen, but he is also a passionate entrepreneur. He embarked on this adventure, just before the crisis and has had some problems starting. So, at the start of this year, we’re in a more serene atmosphere, the beginning of a story, that of the setting up of a group, with all that it entails in terms of work analysis and cross structuring, focused on the development of Full Service. The objective of Gérard Gieux and Dominique Vautier is to build a sound and well structured group offering a full range of cosmetics and make-up products (lipsticks, lipgloss, gloss, balms, foundations, etc.), plastic and wooden pencils, skincare creams, facials and hygiene products; cleansers, lotions, soaps, sticks, all of them ""Made in France. Premium Beauty News - How do you see the future? Florence Lefeuvre - The group needs a commercial harmonization and to improve the value added of its products through marketing, in particular of make-up. I am confident: teams are solid, factories are running well and we have many beautiful textures to promote! So see you soon on the Alkos Group’s stand at Cosmoprof!"
"Barbara Lavernos L’Oréal: ""Making good purchases implies knowing goods!""","Premium Beauty News - 38 factories worldwide, a Purchasing department comprising today 600 employees, a budget of several billion euros ... a beautiful machine! Barbara Lavernos - It’s true that when I arrived at the Group’s Purchasing department in 2004, the purchasing function was taken care of by dedicated teams spread in the plants with all the advantages but also disadvantages of such an organization. We wanted to implement a two-person management organization, with one person who would be focusing on suppliers and the other one who would be dealing with all our internal customers (marketing, research, production ..). And when I say suppliers, if I chose for instance, packaging, I mean a specialised buyer for each sector. So I have specialists in glass, plastic, paper and cardboard, machines, and this, in every major part of the world where we are operating, in Europe, the United States, Brazil, China, etc. Of course, there are some strategic countries in packaging where we do not have any manufacturing facilities, such as Korea, or Japan, where we also have a buyer on the spot. On the other hand, for Africa and the Middle East, purchasing activities are coordinated from Paris with buyers in every major country in the area. What is important is that the Purchasing managers also have a complete vision of the final product. In fact, they are real “Sourcing Centres” with an aim to optimize the supply chain. Premium Beauty News - These centres must handle fortunes! Barbara Lavernos - It’s true! We have Lead buyers who manage portfolios of between 50 and 150 million euros! Which certainly is considerable but on the other hand reinforces their responsibility. It is true that we have significantly strengthened the teams in recent years. Just for packaging, out of the 150 employees present today we hired 40 of them in 2 years time. Premium Beauty News - What are the stakes? Barbara Lavernos - They are huge. Simply imagine: L’Oréal renews each year about 1/3 of its products. In fact, it implies that we could potentially change all our suppliers every three years! But there is nothing to worry about, we are loyal people. I take this opportunity to recall that we do not want to account for more than 25% of our suppliers’ sales, in order not to weaken them or risk creating situations of interdependence, which in the end, wouldn’t be a good idea neither for us nor for them. ""Purchase"" issues are particularly strategic. For this reason, we took advantage of these organizational changes to create SRM [1] transversal functions, but also key functions in control and economic analysis, global dashboards and scorecards. Today, we are able to have a clear vision of our relations, at a given moment, with either one of our suppliers, with a global vision. And not to mention the permanent interactivity that such a tool allows us to have with them, especially as part of our calls for tender, the whole of it constantly showing due regard to the strictest codes of ethics. Premium Beauty News - What about full service? Barbara Lavernos - If you’re implying by that, ""are we going to rely more and more on subcontracting?"" The answer is no! We have our own factories, and a program has been set up to build new production sites for the three years to come. Our factories allow us to produce while being close to our consumers. We consider it a relevant model, and we are keeping it. Currently, there is a tendency towards automation. For some very specific domain, such as pencils, we resort to subcontracting companies that allows us to take advantage of their expertise. Premium Beauty News - The Cherry Pack event you organized last year was the high point of this relationship that you wish to establish on a long-term basis with your suppliers? Barbara Lavernos - In a way, yes! This operation, which took place wonderfully, is a perfect example of that. We had selected five suppliers and we offered them to present their latest innovations. This meeting was the occasion for a number of exchanges, so we will renew the experience this year.  The next meeting is scheduled for late 2011. Premium Beauty News - Presenting exclusive innovations to L’Oréal may be considered sensitive by some of your suppliers. Barbara Lavernos - I see what you’re referring to! Indeed, we have maybe had in the past what could have been perceived as an arrogant attitude on this point. But be assured, it’s not the case. Innovation is at the heart of our business. L’Oréal and Innovation are one. So we’re very aware of these issues. And initiatives such as the Cherry Pack are taken very seriously and surrounded by all necessary guarantees in terms of confidentiality and intellectual property. In addition, the new organization, which has been established in recent years, is also a guarantee for our suppliers. There are no more dilution of responsibilities in our departments, dilution that could result in some bad practices. Premium Beauty News - Are other initiatives underway? Lavernos Barbara - Yes! Six months ago, we decided for example to set up a Solidarity Sourcing program monitored by a department of its own, headed by Chéa Lun. The purpose being to dedicate a portion of the Group’s purchases to disadvantaged communities and to associate our suppliers to this program. These actions that we want to undertake on the basis of an ""ecosystem"" pattern for disable persons, for people in so-called ""difficult"" neighbourhoods but also more generally for populations living in areas of the world that are somewhat markedly lagging behind, as well as small businesses (less than fifty people), etc. We are aware of our responsibilities in this area and our approach is indeed part of a long-term commitment. More than a hundred projects are already under consideration."
Alkos: birth of a group,"The ""new"" Alkos Group is clearly focusing on ""providing all the services of its three entities to the actors in the Beauty, make-up and personal care & hygiene segments."" A reformatting that aims at attracting a market increasingly adept of full service and seduced by the French Touch not say Made in France. 35 million Euros in sales and just a little under 400 people, the Group Alkos currently relies on three distinct activities. – a first plant in Angers, dedicated to the creation of formulas and the filling of skincare and make-up products, with Intercosmétiques ( 21 million Euros in turnover),
– a second plant in Chartres with Sagal, specialized in the manufacturing of soaps and deo sticks (3.5 million Euros in turnover)
– and the Alkos plant for the manufacture of cosmetic pencils in Boulogne sur Mer (10 million Euros in turnover). ""It has become essential,"" explained Dominique Vautier, CEO, ""to bring all these activities under a single banner, the Alkos Group. Especially when you know that our offer is quite consistent with the changing beauty market where demand for full service offers continues to grow.” The pencils business is the group’s main asset.  Alkos operates a recent plant in Boulogne-sur-Mer (9000 m2 of buildings), built from the ground up in 2003, can produce annually about 28 million units of pencils as well as different applicators or conditioners for eyeliners. The unit also proposes formulation services.  ""Plastic or wooden pencils still represent our core business,"" emphasised Nathalie Dessirier, Marketing Manager. A true know-how, this pencil manufacturing activity since it dates back to 1784 !  Yes, you read correctly 1784, the year when a company named Conté invented the insertion of a graphite mine in a wooden cylinder. But it was not until 1961 that the first cosmetic pencils emerged. An activity that really took off in 1996, year of its takeover by Gérard Gieux, leading to the creation of Alkos Cosmétiques a entity of its own that eventually decided to go it alone, and separate from the group of origin. And it was in 2008 that Gérard Gieux acquired Intercosmétiques and Sagal, with the aim of building in the end a real industrial group to supply the beauty market. ""You could say that today, this has been done,"" explained Vautier. ""And the plant in Boulogne-sur-Mer is an integral part of this dynamic both in terms of the new industrial and commercial organization than in terms of product innovation."" A reorganization that resulted in the arrival of newcomers to reinforce the teams at all levels. several new planning, quality and maintenance managers, a new plant manager, Jean-Paul Mariani, and a new controller and a new sales assistant. It’s actually the same buzzing environment with the two other entities, namely Intercosmétiques and Sagal, specialized for the first one, in the creation of formulas and filling activities (skin care and make-up), in Angers, and for the second one in the manufacture of deodorant sticks and scented soaps, in Chartres. By a happy coincidence, these two entities will celebrate this year, their twenty-fifth and thirtieth anniversary. With 30 people and a historical presence in the manufacture of high-end soaps, Sagal ranks high in the list of French companies specialized in this niche market, the biggest activity being the filling and supply of deodorant sticks (70% of the activity). ""The soap market is experiencing a real second youth with the emergence of gift boxes containing true soap collections,"" confided Grégoire Hantz, Sales Director.  A a result, an increase of over 10% in 2010 on 2008 (base year). ""As for the stick,"" explained Hantz, ""it has remained a product experiencing strong growth and for which we have become throughout the years an increasing source of proposals in terms of formulation.” As for Intercosmétiques, the entity dedicated to the creation of formulas and to filling activities in Angers, the turnover of the skincare business (20 million units per year) is now on an equal footing with the make-up business (18 million units). The factory condition creams, gels, milks, lotions, oils and balms. The make-up activity is limited ""for the time being"" to the manufacture of lipsticks (30% of the activity), lip gloss (20%), but also of foundations, mascaras and eyeshadows.  ""We have a real expertise in hot filled processes,” insisted Hantz, ""without forgetting our capacity for airless packaging. We also have a reputation for providing a real quality of service, particularly in for meeting deadlines."" Formulation is another strong point of Intercosmétiques.  “We are far from being mere fillers, since 70% of our business is driven by our ability to formulate and innovate in terms of formulation.” ""It is clear that with such a tool,"" explained Vautier, ""we had the means to become a major European player in formulation, filling and, more generally, in the universe of skincare and make-up. It then seemed only natural to pool our forces. In concrete terms, the Alkos Group is strengthening its offer on turn key projects for which, its ability in managing the development of innovative solutions, the implementation of breakthrough packaging solutions and the conditioning of complete lines, are undoubtedly a number of key assets. And we mustn’t forget the fundamentals which are quality of service and product quality, because the finest product in the world still has to arrive on time at the point of sales, with also the required level of quality."" From these industrial complementarities could only arise a full range of products with both a specific offer and full service. ""It took us a year to develop it,"" explained Nathalie Dessirier, ""but eventually we reached our goal!"" Starting with a new segmentation: Alkos Pro, Alkos Pro Natural, Alkos Limited et Alkos Colors. ""Alkos Pro, is about achieving results with a formula and gestures. We combine products to obtain a result. We use innovative textures. Alkos Pro Natural, is all about natural and organic textures. With Alkos Limited, we offer ephemeral collections meeting the market’s expectations. Finally Alkos Colors seeks to offer a palette of colours/textures sufficiently representative to create a cosmetic line with reduced development times."" Upcoming highlights for the group, the Cosmoprof show, which will be the opportunity to present three new series: ""Aloha, a summer make-up collection"", ""Summer Vibe"" and ""Fruit"" Delights""."
Soupletube unveils an eco-responsible growth project,"Premium Beauty News - Soupletube enters a new era! Francis Beaugrand - Raymond and Yves-Marie Tricard, after developing the group for over forty years, succeeding to their father, in successfully recentering its activity on the fast growing sectors of tubes and plastic bottles and by also selling the historical activity of aluminium tubes in 2006, probably had the feeling that times had come to let a new generation take in charge the management of two topical major issues: markets globalization and the challenge of eco-responsibility. Their priority was to divest the Soupletube group to a new shareholder who would have a good knowledge of the industry and would be able to continue the group’s development while respecting its corporate culture and identity. Premium Beauty News - What is your background and who are the new shareholders? Francis Beaugrand - I have spent twenty years as manager in the Pechiney group and then at Alcan Packaging Beauty in aluminium processing and packaging, which gave me a chance to perfectly understand the operating rules of large international consumer brands but also of the more selective ones and their expectations. I then headed Veriplast Consumer Packaging, which had just been taken over by an investment fund. I thus became familiar with the operating mode of investment funds, characterized by high speed decision making and rigorous management. I then sought to convert these experiences into a more personal project. The takeover of the Soupletube group gave me this opportunity, and involved the creation of a round table. I looked for investments funds wishing to participate to my project while still agreeing to let me play the role of majority shareholder. I am delighted with this association with Paris Orleans and Tim Mezzanine, two partners who will be able to accompany the group in its organic development and external growth. Premium Beauty News - How is Soupletube doing today? Francis Beaugrand - 2010 was a transitional year, characterized by a situation of market recovery after a very difficult previous year which had spared neither the industry nor the group (de-stocking, delayed launches, customers experiencing difficulties...). The mass market and in particular the dental sector performed pretty well and it also was a busy year for the selective segment. We presented our project for Soupletube to major brand owners and launched a new sales dynamic which was very well received by the market. We have every reasons of being confident for 2011 and expect a sustained growth for the first half, with a number of launches and increased orders originating from all our markets. Premium Beauty News - A few figures? Francis Beaugrand - Soupletube is a small ""Global"" multinational group featuring both, guarantees in size and structure allowing to provide excellent services to supply chains of major international or global clients, but also responsiveness and proximity in order to also serve more selective or local brands. Our turnover in 2010 reached 55 million Euros. We employ 480 people in Europe in four factories, three in France (Lisses, Bayonne, Oyonnax) and one Belgium (Chimnay). Our positioning, perfectly represented by our new logo, is original on the market, where operate very large globalized manufacturers and small family owned companies confined to local markets. The new logo wants to convey Soupletube’s new ambition.  Green, colour of vitality, embodies our attention to sustainable development. Grey, colour of technology, evokes our commitment towards innovation. The expanded ""S"" demonstrates our versatility and our will to expand internationally. The whole is framed in square edges symbolizing our professionalism. Premium Beauty News - What are the group’s development priorities? Francis Beaugrand - Our priority is obviously to generate organic growth, by implementing the principles of operational excellence synonymous with performance in terms of quality and service. This approach is supported by a strengthening of our production capacity to offer our customers the flexibility and quantities they need to achieve all their multi-market launches. We are also focusing on product innovation and will be launching many novelties, some of them disruptive, in the next two years. Finally, we are always on the lookout for any external growth opportunities that could arise from emerging markets to locally support our key customers in their growth. Premium Beauty News - One of the strong elements of this strategy is hinged on environment related concepts! Francis Beaugrand - When I took office at the head of the group, I wanted to implement an ambitious plan to limit our environmental impact and to comply with eco-citizen values but also economic efficiency. I believe indeed it is vital for a packaging manufacturer to anticipate regulations and future customer requirements. A dedicated team analysed in detail the subject which led to the creation of a 2011-2013 Triennial Soupletube charter of Eco Responsibility comprising very ambitious commitments; it will be possible to check their implementation and current achievements for those of our customers who like assessing the performance of their suppliers in this area. Premium Beauty News - What are these commitments? Francis Beaugrand - Let’s start with a few figures: – a reduction of 250 tons in our annual consumption of raw materials
– a reduction of 20% in our annual consumption of energy and water
– a reduction of 50% of consumables for our daily operations
– a 20% reduction of fuel for our logistics Not to mention, by 2013, the fact of disposing of a full range of tubes and bottles made from recycled raw materials to offer the market a 20% reduction on the average weight of all our products. Premium Beauty News - There is innovation too! Francis Beaugrand - We invest annually more than 5% of our turnover in R & D and Innovation. Our development plan which was set for the 2011-2013 period is based on three main themes: – A decrease in the use of materials and recyclability (weight reduction of capsules and collars, use of laminated and refined complexes, generalization of the offer to use recycled materials (PCR) for tubes, bottles and caps, suppression of solvents).
– Protection of formulas (reinforcement of the barrier effect for formulas used in colouring and food, adaptation of distribution solutions to help reduce oxidation).
– Improve the value added of our clients’ products and brands (new types of finishes, design of new forms of caps and collars and applicators to enhance the practicality of use for the consumer). Premium Beauty News - Finally, you want to offer additional services! Francis Beaugrand - We want to go beyond mere customer satisfaction and offer the market innovative services in the world of packaging to facilitate designing, development and industrialization. This involves the supply of small quantities of decorated tubes and bottles to undertake consumer tests or pre launch products presentations. This also requires modelling and sampling, not to mention consumers or distributors perception tests for new packaging projects."
"Now in France, soap has its Institute","Premium Beauty News - What is the weight of soaps on today’s cosmetics market in Europe? Laurent Bousquet - The European production of soap would exceed 850,000 tonnes. It has been decreasing from 1 to 2% a year since 10 years in favour of liquid soaps. There are two categories: household soaps that belong to the sector of detergents and toilet soaps that belong to the cosmetics sector.  These markets correspond to different trade organizations, but it is difficult to separate them. Soap would account for over 20% of the bath and shower products market in Europe and the United States. Premium Beauty News - An old story that the one of soap? Laurent Bousquet - Quite old, indeed! Soaps are the oldest known surfactants, obtained from the reaction of a base on a fatty substance. Their story began more than 5,000 years ago but their exact chemistry is only known since 1823. As for the first synthetic surfactant it appeared in 1916. Their use became widespread as of 1945 to the detriment of soaps. Despite its age, soap can address our current concerns. Indeed, its manufacturing process can be friendly with the environment.  There are some saponification techniques that use neutral oils or refined fatty substances thus allowing making soap without any rejection and thus no pollution. Soaps are also biodegradable.  They are easily removed in sewage treatment plants and have very low toxicity if released into the environment. Finally, soaps rely on renewable resources. All animal and vegetable fats can potentially be transformed into soap, even if it is necessary in most cases to combine them with different oils or fats to obtain a commercially interesting soap (consistency, volume of foam). Between 2000 and 3000 oil plants exist on the planet, not to mention all the oilseeds. Premium Beauty News - Therefore, soaps are sustainable products? Laurent Bousquet - They have the potential for that.  Even if today, for economic reasons, South-East Asia has become the world’s leading producer of soaps.  These soaps are derived from palm oil, to the detriment of primary forests; and they also require the use of a lot of fossil fuels to be shipped all over the world. A number of shorter circuits are emerging again, based on sometimes very ancient traditions: saponification derived from olive and laurel oils in Syria, shea butter in Mali or Guinea, argan oil in Morocco, locally manufactured through a cold process. Premium Beauty News -  Soaps are sometimes criticized and blamed for drying or irritating the skin. Laurent Bousquet - Contrary to popular belief, soaps are well tolerated by all skin types. They are in particular responsible for a fairly low rate of allergies. If they are sometimes accused of drying or irritating the skin, it is also because they are not always formulated and manufactured in the prospect of modern needs but in a purely economic logic or with the use of obsolete technology. Premium Beauty News - So, finally, is it really a product of the future? Laurent Bousquet - Yes. When we’ll realize the extent of global pollution and the toxicity related to the manufacturing process or to the use of synthetic surfactant, and when synthetic surfactants become more expensive to manufacture than soap because of rising oil prices and the widespread of “carbon taxes”. This is the reason why I imagined the creation of the Institute of Soap. Premium Beauty News - How must one proceed to become a soap ""specialist""? Laurent Bousquet - The needs are extremely varied and there is no specific training focusing on soap.  However a training exists in the field of fatty substances and chemists all have heard of saponification. Companies need trained personnel in manufacturing, packaging, testing, especially with the gradual introduction of Good Manufacturing Practices. Training can therefore take the form of modules, which are inserted in the initial professional training.  Equivalent needs exist in continuous training for employees with a position or under reclassification. To note that a number of micro-enterprises are emerging in the field of soap, using simple methods of saponification with a cold process, widely available on the Internet. This activity is similar to craft, and people involved are eager to benefit from qualifying courses. Many regional structures close to economic actors can promote these courses  : COSMED, the University of fragrances and flavours (Université Européenne des Senteurs & Saveurs - UESS), etc. Premium Beauty News - Is the research component important for the Institute of Soap? Laurent Bousquet - Whether the training is individual or in a group, support will be offered in terms of funding, research and selection of partners and for the project implementation. Topics are already planned, such as the ones in line with the goal of: – promoting soap like a environmentally friendly product. (E.g. Characterization of biodegradability in different sectors),
– ·promoting soap as a sustainable product. (E.g. comparison of the ""carbon"" cost of various personal care products and soaps),
– ·promoting innovation and economic development. (E.g. studying the incidence of soaps on microbial growth). It is also the case of a number of topics related to research and development of new oils. Premium Beauty News - This will surely require a significant effort in terms of communication? Laurent Bousquet - Yes and obviously we will need a dedicated website, and our participation to trade shows will have to be considered with different partners. Finally, the creation of an event intended for the general public on the soap, its history and its uses will also be a great help to promote the benefits of soap compared to other hygiene products. Premium Beauty News - Who are or will be your partners? Laurent Bousquet - We are targeting all companies in the sector: manufacturers, brand owners, raw material suppliers and importers. There are also some experts. Several advisers, companies or structures already operating in this area may well become interesting partners. On the training side, many existing training courses already include modules related to soap. Several laboratories have already expressed their interest to collaborate in research programs in France but also with countries around the Mediterranean. And then there are also some important collectors and many people who once considered the creation of a Museum and who will be an important support during the general public day in particular."
Strong growth for Primapack in 2010,"The Cosfibel Group’s subsidiary in charge of developing standard, primary or specific packaging (lipstick, mascara, make-up cases, perfume caps or closures for spirits, ...) has achieved a strong growth in 2010 with a turnover exceeding 21 million euros. The trading business of the Cosfibel Group almost doubled in four years. According to Jean-Luc Haulet, Deputy Managing Director, this increase in recent years is due both to a greater penetration among traditional customers and winning new customers under the company’s core target which is make-up, but also and above all, thanks to the conquest of new markets in the areas of skincare and other sectors such as spirits (especially Brandy). “To manage to increase our turnover from a little more than 12 million euros to over 21 million euros in four years,” stressed Haulet ""has only been possible because of this diversification"".  2010 will also be remembered with a 200% increase in the number of new clients! To note that Primapack relies on three offices in China, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Shenzhen that takes in charge the sourcing, the development and delivery monitoring as well as quality control. Main field of expertise, metal and plastic injection, multi-materials, decorations and various surface treatments, stamping, galvanizing and electroplating. As far as the beauty sector is concerned, good examples of launches to which the company participated in 2010 include: Burberry’s complete make-up line, which is encountering a huge success among professionals and consumers, the Kenzoki skincare line, by Kenzo Parfums, Guerlain’s mini lipstick and a By Terry’s lipstick. As for projects to come, they are numerous. “We have filed a patent for a refillable pen and another one for nomadic cases,” added Haulet.  “Which confirms that we are indeed in line with our vocation of being first and foremost, designers/creators.”"
Aircos: objectives are achieved!,"As anticipated by Eric Merville, Aircos’ General Manager, in an interview published by Premium Beauty News last September the turnover of its company increased by 50% in 2010 over to the previous year.  The annual sales of the French firm specialized in the manufacture of cosmetic products and packaging thus nears 16 million euros. “A performance that is not only due to the sector’s recovery after the 2009 crisis but also to a real increase of our market shares!” now explains Eric Merville. More than 40 people were hired by the company in just two years! Goals for 2011: internationalization, particularly focused on Northern Europe. Let us look back in time... Aircos relies on three main activities: plastic injection on its site in Ardon (130km South of Paris), formulation with two laboratories in Boulogne Billancourt (near Paris) and Romorantin (230km South of Paris) and manufacturing and packaging, also in the factory in Romorantin. ""Fortunately we had invested heavily in 2009 on the site of Romorantin,"" emphasised Eric Merville. ""This allowed us to cope with the extraordinary growth of 2010! A site, as you know, which has a production and packaging capacity of more than 110 million units per year."" As planned, 2011 will be the year chosen by Aircos to develop its activities on gloss and lipstick segments. ""But we are also working on new manufacturing and packaging processes for powder products,"" adds Merville. The total investment planned for this year will exceed 750,000 euros with, among others, plans to increase the production capacity. As for our Full Service activity, it’s still on the rise.  ""As I already stated previously, we are giving ourselves the means to become full-service specialists. This is clearly a centrepiece of Aircos’ development for the years to come. We master all the different components of make-up. This know-how allows us to provide our customers with the full responsibility of the product, including of course the packaging part.”"
Heinz Glas: construction of a new furnace,"The decision was taken just a few days ago. The Heinz Glas group (EUR 280 million in turnover in 2010 including 220 million for the ""Glass"" activity) is going to build new furnace dedicated to the perfume industry, in Kleintettau on its German site. The investment representing more than 25 million euros. The new furnace will have a capacity of 40 tons/day and to start with, will supply, two IS machines. It will be commissioned in January 2012. An investment that will also be complemented with a strengthening of the industrial tool in terms of finishing with the introduction of a third vacuum coating bell, a new lacquering line, a new automatic screen-printing line and a new automatic tampo printing line for a cost of about 2 million euros. To date, Heinz Glas has no fewer than four furnaces in Germany, two in Poland, two in China and one in Peru. A series of decision that take place at times when the Germany-headquartered group has literally pulverized its objectives in 2010 with a turnover that soar from 230 million in 2009 to 280 million! It is mainly on the ""glass"" activity that the group will have achieved the best results, particularly in France, thanks to such successful launches as the new bottle for Opium and Belle d’Opium by Yves Saint Laurent, without forgetting of course, Ricci Ricci by Nina Ricci, So Elixir and Vanille Noire by Yves Rocher.

Ancorotti Cosmetics: 12 million in 2011,"For Renato and Enrica Ancorotti, the founders of Ancorotti Cosmetics, the adventure started a few months ago is definitely a success.  “It started in 2008, explains Enrica Ancorotti, a year to be really remembered as a pivotal year for us, made of major changes and important decisions. Because it is truly our passion for the world of beauty that led us to create this new company specialized in the production of mascara. During the 2009/2010 period, it is clear that we encountered quite a few difficulties, but also a lot of satisfactions, especially thanks to our customers confidence.” In any case, the year 2010 was dynamic enough to enable the company to exceed its objectives with a turnover of EUR 5.5 million in the end. A year during which the production capacity per team was of 1,900 kg allowing the filling of some 60,000 units/packagings. “In 2011 we are planning to ramp up the capacity to 2900 Kg per team, explained Enrica Ancorotti, allowing the filling of 90,000 units/packs.” The projected turnover for 2011 is of EUR 12 million. To note that 95% of the turnover for 2010 concerns the sale of mascara (bulk and full service). The remaining 5% concerns the marketing of other eye products. “In 2011 we will concentrate the same way we did with mascara, on the other two products that help increase customer loyalty and are among best sellers in the world, namely foundation/concealers and lip glosses/liquid products for lips.”"
Schwan-STABILO Cosmetics: “Success begins with the consumer’s demand”,"With an increase of 7.1% between June 2009 and June 2010, the management of Schwan-STABILO [1] has every reason to be satisfied with the evolution of the turnover of the group’s Cosmetics division during this ""turbulent"" period.  The cosmetics division is growing at a higher rate than the rest of the group [2], and the current fiscal year could be exceptional! ""195 million Euros in turnover for the Cosmetics division alone instead of the 180 million foreseen between June 2009 and June 2010 ...,  It is true that this really was a surprise,"" we were told at the group’s headquarters. It was such a surprise that the program set up to reduce staff and working hours which had been implemented to last at least until the end of 2010 had to be postponed as of the month of March and the group even had to rely on more temporary workers than it had anticipated. ""2010 will remain as an extraordinary year for our business,"" states the Schwan-STABILO group in a recent release. ""The main segments responsible for this increase obviously still are cosmetic pencils for eyes and lips but also and mainly the outcome of the research and development work carried out by our engineers to improve the application of these products and their resistance, not to mention all the eco friendly developments of products still featuring identical qualities."" Another source of satisfaction,the integration of the U.S. firm Cosmolab (300 staff, USD 40 million in sales expected this year) in the scope of the group following its final acquisition last spring. ""Now we are able to be present on some midrange niche markets that were not accessible to us due to the remoteness of our European plants, but also mainly because of the higher-end positioning of our products.” Finally, the group’s strategy to improve its industrial footprint and to establish business partnerships in every corner of the world is also bearing fruit. China, in particular, can only act as a strong growth driver. Schwan-STABILO Cosmetics is first of all an impressive research and production tool the headquarters and soul of which being located a few miles away from Nuremberg, in Heroldsberg. Cosmetic sharpenable pencils (227 million units produced during FY 2009/2010), mechanical plastic pencils, (122 million units), applicators with all types of liquid substances and mascara (42 million units), and other miscellaneous products (16 million), hefty production figures, the least one can say. International market shares that continue to grow (currently 48% of all products) with the United States being the leading market, totalising more than 140 million product units sold, followed by Europe (125 million units) and South America (70 million), Asia (43 million) and the rest of the world (29 million). ""Market Success does not start with the product itself, underline people in Heroldsberg, but with the demand from the product’s user himself. It Is essential for us to focus on the consumer with a differentiated understanding of target groups, a product development that responds to the requirements of individual market segments, an openness toward new market potential and the ability to develop it exactly at the right moment. Dynamic markets call for fast action.  Speed is crucial."" Apparently, the 2011 collection is no exception to the group’s reputation in terms of innovations. Without going into too many details, we can name the METAL MANIC line which features in particular the FUNK2, a water-based liquid ink with a fine brush applicator that allows creating both fine or thicker lines, and the TOUCH 4, a creamy eye-shadow with silicon gel-based formula, and a non oily texture that is absolutely smudge and crease proof and stays on and on."
Baralan relies more than ever on its assets,"With 30 million euros in sales expected this year, the Baralan group will be ending 2010 in progress compared to the previous year. The Baralan group now employs a staff of 105 people and comprises five separate companies.  In addition to the traditional design and distribution activity of standard packaging in Europe, the group features Labor Plast Moulding (plastic injection), Gloss Tech (surface treatment, coating, metallization), Inovo Design and Arrowpak in the United States. Standard glass bottles constitute the main market of the packaging activity itself, and include the bottles for conditioning nail polishes, which still represent 65% of Baralan’s turnover!  On this segment, the Italian company offers the bottle but also its accessories, including of course, the closures equipped with their brushes.  To be noted in this regard, the announced release, early 2011 of new products for skincare and make-up. ""On this market of standard glass bottles,"" confessed executives at the headquarters in Milano, ""our assets, compared to large global players in the glass industry, still remain in a wide variety of choice and our swiftness and quality of service."" With forty five agents in the world and a very strong presence to all international exhibitions dedicated to the beauty sector, Baralan continues to rely on the strength of its network and the broadness of its range to reach all segments of a large and diversified customer base."
Witoplast: Two new production lines for plastic tubes,"Twenty million euros in turnover, 230 people, Witoplast which was founded in 1992 for the production of bottles, has become thanks to its production lines for tubes since 1998 only, a European heavyweight in the production of flexible plastic tubes, mono-layer, multi-layer co-extruded and laminated (the latter being more widely used for toothpaste through ABL or EVOH barriers for more cosmetic-type products). Largest producer in Poland, the firm generates more than half of its turnover from exports and owns twenty injection moulding machines to manufacture its own caps and closures. The company is also equipped with highly efficient decoration machines that can also print, up to seven colours in screen-printing, and up to eight colours offset as well as hot-stamping. It also has its own dedicated workshop for the manufacture of extrusion blow moulds. Fully automated lines still make it possible for some employees to work ""off-line"" in a somewhat independent way, to produce small batches required for orders coming from France. According to Christian Chirinian from Chirine International, its partner in France, Witoplast is currently completing the installation of two new production lines for plastic tubes.  At the start of next year, the production capacity of the firm based near Warsaw will thus totalize seven lines in operation, enabling the company to produce about 150 million PE tubes per year. To note also within the bottling department of the firm, the commissioning of several machines to manufacture PET bottles with the use of NISSEI equipments. They will operate in parallel to existing extrusion blow moulding machines for multilayer bottles intended primarily to serve the food industry in particular ketchup and mustard. ""We are business partners of Witoplast, since several years in France and we can say with no hesitation that service, quality, swiftness of action and proximity allow us to be a supplier many of our customers can rely on,"" underlines Christian Chirinian, who also is a business partner of South Korea’s Hana via Linea-Chirine (Airless Systems). “We offer a full range of standard tubes, explains Christian Chirinian, whether it be in diameter 19 (labial, with a cannula or standard), diameter 25 (screw on), in sizes of 30, 35, 40, 50 and 50 elliptical (to screw on or with a service cap and finally bi-injected for the elliptical model). Sleeves for capsules and seals for the heads are also available. This gives us the possibility of offering printed tubes from 5 to 320 ml.” Latest novelty to date, the offset printing technique called:  ""Full body printing"" which enables full printing on a white (or transparent) sleeve of bright colours without resorting to the use of a colour injected sleeve (thus reducing costs) while printing right up to the interior of the shoulder, a surface which is hidden by the cap. This technique can be applied to all existing diameters from 19 to 50 mm. Note that technicians at Witoplast are currently working on a new printing technique called ""high resolution"" and on a new 16 mm diameter breakable tube. Launches of which are planned late 2011."
Hermann Koch: 8 million euros invested in four years!," New products  It’s a strong change in management process that Hermann Koch has been experiencing, during several months. [1]  Through the impetus given by its new CEO, Christian Lützenrath, it is a big part of the organization and industrial objectives including the product range which are being rethought. The first objective for the German converter specialized in plastic injection, extrusion and blow injection, is to innovate and offer new products to the customer market. Main production, still today, with 75 per cent, a full range of jars of many different sizes mainly PP-made. ""We have decided, among others things,"" explain Melanie Krempel and Susanne Heinrich at the Marketing and Innovation Department, in Coburg, ""to create several new standard lines combining jars, but also bottles with new design.""  A decision which paid off with the new line Sipario introduced for the first time this year. And it only the beginning of it. Each year will see a new line emerge. ""We are lucky enough to have a solid industrial tool,"" points out Christian Lützenrath.  Indeed, Hermann Koch is equipped with 80 injection machines ranging from 25 tons to 320 tons, among which six are electric and three bi-injection machines (all of them Arburg), 15 blow-moulding extrusion machines including a four print Magic which can produce some 1,200 bottles per hour, ten screen printing machines and eight hot stamping machines. Not to mention seven compression machines that allow to produce Bakelite-made products."
Faber-Castell Cosmetics: significant growth in 2010,"Premium Beauty News - Finally your cosmetic branch came out pretty much unscathed from the 2009 year, so gloomy for the global economy! Stefano Castelletti - Yes, indeed! But it has little to do with chance. It is also the result of a thorough work, which was carried out industrially by automating at the most, by increasing the efficiency and the effectiveness of our processes  This obviously makes us much stronger now that demand is skyrocketing. Premium Beauty News - Recovery is not the only cause for the strong growth you will be recording in 2010! Stefano Castelletti - No! There are three main reasons for this increase. Growth of course which is the consequence of larger orders coming in from our customers reflected from the restocking from trade, but there is also a strong demand for our new products such as Pure Liptint and Tint’ n’ Gloss which encountered quite a lot of success with current customers but also new ones. And that’s in fact the third reason for our growth, the arrival of new customers. Premium Beauty News - What are these new customers attracted by? Stefano Castelletti - Clearly by our innovations and marketing concepts, in particular also with the lead we took three years ago in the development of products in line with new environmental concerns.  With Truly Natural we were the first ones to offer a range of Ecocert certified products in 2008. We already had been granted the FSC certification and the German BDIH certification. And now we also offer NaTrue compliant formulas. In 2010 we presented an Organic Nail Care concept also in compliance with Ecocert and BDIH. And we will be continuing our efforts with Earthbound the new Ecocert organic concept for eyes and lips, formulated with a gentle and natural ingredient that is grown exclusively from organic sources and harvested in accordance with the supplier environmental and fair trade charter. This is in line with our philosophy, principles and responsibilities since sustainability, fair trade, people and environment are part of Faber-Castell’s core values. Premium Beauty News -But this is only one part of your strategy? Stefano Castelletti - Yes, only a very small part. We are placing great value in the multi-functionality of our products, but also on the ""long lastingness"" aspect of our formulas. This aspect is still a strong trend on the market. But we are also trying to find new ways of extending our pencils applications to other uses in the world of make-up. Wooden pencils are not left behind, on the contrary. They are receiving a great deal of attention especially in terms of new decorating techniques  like the innovative 3-D graphics with elevated touch.  In this regard we will soon offer a technology that we’re in the process of acquiring and which will make it possible to propose a customised decoration for almost every pencil. Premium Beauty News - On the subject of your latest marketing initiatives, you have just signed an representation agreement for your products in Italy with Ancorotti Cosmetics. Stefano Castelletti - That’s right! I am proud to announce this new milestone for Faber-Castell Cosmetics. This strategic partnership is an ideal combination for both of us, made of expertise and creativity and allowing us, we are convinced, to develop and offer innovative and attractive products. Premium Beauty News - Should you produce more in your existing plants or consider new industrial facilities in other theatres of operation? Stefano Castelletti - That is indeed a topical question, and a question which needs to be thoroughly considered too! It is obvious that we adapt ourselves and that we will adjust our production capacity to market growth. As a family-owned company with a long tradition we believe in long term business development and partnership with our customers."
SGD Asia Pacific: 15% annual growth for the past 12 years!,"Premium Beauty News - Actually, the presence of SGD in the region dates back to longer than the opening of your plant! Cyril Ruiz Moise - Yes. Before being present industrially, commercially speaking, we were already, in the region as of 1950. The plant’s current location dates back to 1998. Then it all went very quickly. The factory was granted its ISO 9001:2000 certification in 2003. Three years later, we set up our decoration workshop and we began to really tackle cosmetic markets. In 2008, we set up our first ""gray"" room for the ""cold end"" and decoration section. In 2009, we obtained the following certifications: SA 8000, ISO 9001:2008, SFDA Shanghai Office. And finally, 2010 saw the commissioning of our Class 100000 clean room. Premium Beauty News - A few figures? Cyril Ruiz Moise - Yes, gladly! SGD Asia Pacific in figures has currently a coverage in sixteen countries of Asia, representing about 250 clients served and 250 million bottles! Premium Beauty News - What made the difference during these past twelve years? Cyril Ruiz Moise - Actually, we were committed in reproducing here, all the technologies and levels of quality we already had in Europe or South America. The same clean rooms, the same control procedures, the same specifications, the same quality levels, the same certifications (ISO, Pharmacopeas, GMP etc..). Our efforts in terms of decorative capacity will have also weighed heavily, not to mention our capacity in standard moulds (a hundred of them!), ranging from 5 ml to 1 litre and our flexibility. May I remind you that we have a high-performance lacquering line (45,000 pieces/day) not to mention our eight hot stamping machines (52,000 pieces/day) and our eleven screen printing machines (60,000 pieces/day). Of course, and this is the advantage of being part of a group, we also take advantage from the entire offer and synergies of the SGD Group, from our latest developments in sustainable development, and finally from the ""Infinite Glass"" (from 100% recycled glass) ... Premium Beauty News - What are the three keys of your success? Cyril Ruiz Moise - I would summarize by saying: Quality, Time to Market and Local Expertise! Premium Beauty News - Is environment as an important issue in Asia Pacific than it is in Europe or in the US? Cyril Ruiz Moise - Absolutely! Obviously the trend is more recent, but it is even more important to be able to address it now. And, as you know, the Group has a number of concrete solutions. It is a necessity. The ""Infinite Glass"" is one of the solutions. But hinged to this concept, there are real industrial challenges like for instance, hydro-based lacquering, preservation of water resources, treatment of industrial waste, etc."
L’Oréal takes care of its suppliers to multiply by four its production capacity in Asia!,"Attending L’Oréal’s Supplier Day Asia Pacific, more than 350 people, coming from 140 companies producing raw materials, packaging, machines, including almost all of the Group’s sub-contractors operating in the area. Main targeted and achieved goals: share the group’s vision in Asia for the next decade to come and reward the work carried out by a number of suppliers during the past three years. Twelve of them received a reward. Orchestrator of this big show the Asia Pacific Sourcing Centre of the L’Oréal Group. “A great initiative very well organized, informative, professional and friendly...” These were roughly the comments that punctuated, here and there, conversations among the community of supplier concerned by this meeting. On the afternoon of November 9th, on the eve of Cosmoprof Asia, participants attended several speeches including those of Frédéric Heinrich, Director of Operations, Jacques Sebban, Director of Sourcing Asia Pacific, Christopher Guesnet, Corporate packaging purchasing Director, not to mention the introductory video by Jochen Zaumseil, Vice President General Manager of the Asia Pacific zone, also followed by that of Barbara Lavernose CPO World, and by other trades in Operations and stakeholders in Research and Innovation. ""In fact,"" we were told at L’Oréal, ""this half day of presentations, information and meetings was the result of a strong demand expressed by our suppliers after a big survey we had conducted a few months ago.  The organization of such an event was one of the main expectations expressed by suppliers, in order to reward the work carried out jointly, to explain the group’s strategy and to outline a vision as clear as possible on the needs to come with, at the end, an open and direct questions and answers session between business partners."" Attendants learned that the L’Oréal group’s challenge in Asia was represented by an impressive figure, the arrival of 500 million new consumers in the next ten years to come. The figure is resulting in a direct impact on the group’s production capacity which should then be multiplied by four during this period! All the Group’s factories in the region will be concerned, namely the two existing plants in China and those located in Indonesia, India and Japan, a total of five. To note that the group is taking this opportunity to build a brand new factory in Indonesia which should be operational by mid 2011. At the same time, L’Oréal is launching a hefty program to extend the capacity of the factory located in India. “Furthermore, the group is already looking for new sites to increase its presence in China, India, and the ASEAN,” underlined L’Oréal’s executives in front of an audience obviously delighted to hear such a program. Business is business! Icing on the cake for the 140 attending suppliers, the classification of results rewarding the best of them and this in all areas of the container/content activity, without forgetting sub-contractors to the sector for the following axes: quality, supply chain, innovation as well as a global price of excellence. 12 suppliers were singled out. And this year the global award of excellence was granted to the packaging company Beautystar."
B.Kolor: shifting into higher gear,"Premium Beauty news - Your presence is noticeable! If only because of your willingness to be attending all major trade shows in the world. Mario De Luigi - The stand is actually the visible part of the iceberg. This is the result of a daily work of questioning, of creativity and innovation. B.Kolor has achieved giant’s steps in recent months to elaborate and develop new materials, new skin touches, new sensations, the whole of it in harmony with current market needs. Premium Beauty nnews - And those needs, what are they precisely? Mario De Luigi - The world is going in two fundamental directions that are opposite yet at the same time complementary: on the one hand there is a tendency to get closer and more respectful of nature through the use of elements that the planet can autonomously regenerate and on the other hand, there is daily progress in technological developments that are functional to the life of human beings. The latter does not exclude the former, the technological objectives respect nature as creation and as evolution of systems that were devised over the years. A new energy that is acting as a propeller towards a healthier, more comfortable and trouble-free future. Rhythms are changing and the quest for global well-being tends to replace the purely material research. Levels of well-being and well-looking are now a gobal well-being which tends to replace the purely material research. Levels of well being and well looking are now construed to match specific individual needs. Premium Beauty News - So this is a complete new range of products. Mario De Luigi - Yes, it is a range of cosmetics which have been produced using the maximum vegetable contents possible with up to 100 % natural results. A post organic evolution that intends to raise the concept of nature where human beings would draw from everything the planet has to offer and which the planet itself could renew regardless of the will of man. Inside this range of cosmetics, we have «Vegan», a collection for those who changed this concept into a philosophy of life. It is earmarked with respectful and meticulous care for detail. «Biotech» is a highly-scientific functional organic range, a combination that ensures performance comparable with the best engineering innovation has to offer. A very important section in our company because for the last six years we have worked very hard in this area to obtain exceptional products.
But there are also «Cheminature», «Perfomers», «Effect», «Stay» and «Glam glass». It is much better to see and touch them than speak about them. Premium Beauty News - Your presence abroad continues to increase. Mario De Luigi - Quite true! We have approached many new territories in the world, following our one-small-step-at-a-time philosophy. Today we can consider ourselves as an international reality. Given the specificity of our products and the success they encounter, requirements  are huge and within reach. We don’t want to miss these opportunities and believe me, we won’t!"
"Tim Eaves, Quadpack: “150 million euros by 2015!” ","Premium Beauty News - What is your recipe for success? Tim Eaves - It would be no exaggeration to say we have become almost unavoidable in the personal care packaging industry.  This is simply a question of numbers. Out of the 75 people currently working at Quadpack, 50 are involved in business development. These specialists are continually in direct contact with the market, to understand requirements and source all the latest of innovations that could provide our customers with effective, original and quality solutions. Only a half of these 50 staff is dedicated to sales and marketing; the other half is involved in operations, which covers highly specialised areas such as development, sourcing, qualityassurance and logistics. Premium Beauty News - And what do the remaining 25 do? Tim Eaves - The rest carry out supporting functions – and they are each just as essential and just as talented in their own areas. Our success is driven by the motivation and enthusiasm of our workforce at all levels. Everyone’s contribution is vital and appreciated, and everyone works hard. And believe me, there is plenty to do! We are currently present in 11 countries and our customer base continues to grow. You know that historically Quadpack is the result of a business partnership of three companies: one based in Spain, one in France and one in the UK. We were already in essence an international operation. And so, from the outset, we naturally established ourselves in the United States, then in Israel, Poland, Turkey, Australia, Germany, Italy, etc. Premium Beauty News - And the flagship partner in your portfolio is Korea’s Yonwoo. Tim Eaves - That’s right. We have an excellent partnership. Yonwoo represents more than 50 per cent of our business. It is an extremely dynamic and successful company, where the day-to-day driving force is Innovation, with a capital ‘I’. Don’t forget that this company currently generates more than US$140 million in sales and annually produces some 450 million products, of which a great part is aimed at supplying the airless market, where Yonwoo can be considered as one of the undisputed world leaders. This leadership will undoubtedly strengthen in the months to come, as Yonwoo has announced a production increase of 40 per cent. However, we also source from other companies in other regions of the world. There is China, of course, where we have just broadened our presence, but also Europe. Premium Beauty News - You speak of sourcing, but you are also very proactive in the research and development of new products or concepts? Tim Eaves - You’re right! The term ‘sourcing’ is over-simplistic, because we have always been concerned with, and are increasingly involved in the design and even the manufacture of the packaging solutions we sell. Our responsibility goes well beyond a simple partnership. And, as a matter of fact, more and more often we own the intellectual rights. Premium Beauty News - You just took a majority stake in the company Spirit. Tim Eaves - That’s right! Spirit is a well-established company in the gifting and promotional market. Acquisition of Spirit allows us to offer a broader range of products and services. Premium Beauty News - With Yonwoo as a main partner, people tend to label you as a specialist of airless and high end products. Tim Eaves - This is only a small part of the picture. On the one hand, we operate in many other areas of beauty packaging and, on the other hand, our aim is precisely to extend our influence in what is commonly called ‘masstige’. It is true that we are one of the leaders in the airless segment and we pride ourselves on the excellence of our products in this area, but our range is extensive and continues to grow, in glass and plastic jars and bottles, in dispensers and closures and, now, also in make-up. Premium Beauty News - Is make-up a segment where you have ambitions? Tim Eaves - Absolutely! You may have noticed it this year with the launch of several products, including a brand new heated mascara that uses a double-headed applicator to achieve long and elegant eyelashes. One end of the applicator has a professional mascara brush; the other end has a heated wand especially designed to smooth out clumps, shape eyelashes and maximise volume. Premium Beauty News - Anything else in the pipeline? Tim Eaves - Yes, of course. Our sourcing office based in South Korea is already developing some very innovative solutions with various manufacturing partners and some of these will be presented at the second edition of the MakeUp in Paris show next June at the Carrousel du Louvre. Premium Beauty News - Can you venture a forecast regarding the turnover of Quadpack for the next five years? Tim Eaves - Reasonably, yes! 150 million euros!"

Alcan Packaging Beauty changes name to Albéa,"Alcan Packaging Beauty today announced its new company brand name.  Acquired by Sun European Capital, a subsidiary of Capita Partner, in July 2010, the specialist of cosmetic packaging, changes name to Albéa. “The semantics of Albéa evoke the word ‘beauty’ and symbolize material embellishment, referring to our core business. The letter A at the beginning and at the end of the name reflects its openness,” says the company in a release. The company also changes its logo, opting for a cell-shaped image “directly inspired by the protective honeycomb and its natural potential for expansion.” “It represents our protection of and great care for our customers’ products and all the markets we serve, as well as our focus to support their development worldwide,” explained Francois Luscan, President and CEO of Albéa.

Coty strengthens its makeup business,"Already rich with a broad portfolio of licenses (including Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, Cerruti, Chloe, Jil Sander, Marc Jacobs [1]), the prestige division of the Coty group, who also holds the license of Calvin Klein fragrances, has announced the development and commercialization in 2012 of a full makeup line for the brand. Without revealing the concept of the range, Bernd Beetz, Coty’s CEO, already announced its willingness to “push the boundaries of the colour cosmetics category as we know it.” Coty has also announced the purchase of 100% shares of Dr. Scheller Cosmetics (DSC) from Russian group Kalina.  With to its Manhattan mass-market brand, DSC is a leading make-up player in Germany and its acquisition allows Coty to reach the second place on the German market.  Kalina had already sold DSC’s industrial capabilities to Weckerle. Following DSC’s buy out, Coty’s market share on the make-up segment in Germany will rise from 7% to 17%. In total, make-up should amount to 25% of Coty’s sales. The group also intends to use DSC’s existing distribution networks to boost its other make-up brands, including Astor, Rimmel and Esprit Cosmetics. In recent weeks, rumours have grown concerning Coty’s possible acquisition of US nail polish manufacturer OPI. With a 6% market share of the U.S. nail polish market, OPI would allow Coty to strengthen its business on this fast-growth segment, while refocusing its positioning on high-end products.  According to Bloomberg, Coty is emerging as the most likely buyer for an amount that could reach about one billion US dollars. These various announcements are part of Coty’s development programme, which must lead the group to achieve a turnover of 7 billion U.S. dollars by 2015."
Dupont is present on all fronts of perfumery and cosmetics,"DuPont’s engineers have managed to breathe new life to their famous Surlyn resin, which had already caused quite a stir when it appeared on markets in the late 1980s. Among the developments that can demonstrate those latest successes arethe new overmoulded Surlyn glass bottle launched by the pair Bormioli Luigi - Pibiplast, without forgetting the design by VPI of this amazing transparent collar impregnated with fine bells of lily.  One can also mentions the cap and collar designed by Rexam for Balenciaga’s latest fragrance: the amber pale juice is conditioned in a prismatic bottle with a ivory looking collar moulded in Surlyn and crowned with a cracked porcelain cap, also in Surlyn recalling ancient vases of the 18th century.  And several other innovations are in the pipeline... The American chemist is also introducing new grades in its DuPont Selar PA range which will ensure a high barrier for packaging meant to contain solvent-based products such as some waterproof mascaras or nail polishes. Not to mention this new synthetic fibre, Natrafil, which can replace the traditional goat hair used the manufacture of make-up brushes ..."
Maesa takes full advantage of recovery,"After a particularly trying 2009 year from every point of view, (economic crisis coupled with drastic restructuring of the U.S. entity in the wake of the acquisition of Zorbit Resources), the young group that designs and manufactures lines of beauty product and scented products, as well as customized packaging is seeing the future under more favourable auspices. Main highlights of the first six months of 2010: several new contracts with global leaders in distribution (Payless ShoeSource and Zara), and an increase in capital underwritten almost entirely by U.S. managers which lead to a reinforcement of equity of 3.4 million euros.  Furthermore, shareholder officers (Jill Belasco, CEO USA, Sean Brosmith, Creative Director, USA and Scott Oshry, President of Maesa Studio) have joined the two founders at the Board of Directors.

IL Cosmetics is strengthening its investment plan,"One year ago, by announcing an investment plan for an amount nearly equalling half the 2009 turnover (23 million euros), out of which 6 million euros to be invested by 2011, IL Cosmetics seemed to be ignoring the crisis.  Actually, the group was investing in both its traditional market, nail polish, and in mascara, eyeliner and gloss, segments, keeping in mind a ""full service"" approach. Today, facts seem to prove him right. Not only has the nail polish market soared, but demand on new make-up segments is also very strong. Premium Beauty News - Is the growth in 2010 confirmed in your company’s figures? Eric Wimmer - Absolutely! The group’s 2010 turnover will have grown by 25% compared to 2010 for the global activity and even by 35% for the ""full service"" activity. When you know that the overall market of nail polish rose by 10% in Europe, it gives you a better understanding of our performance. Premium Beauty News - Precisely, how do you explain this performance? Eric Wimmer - When analysing different consumer countries, we notice that Germany is probably the European country that experienced the strongest increase in nail polish consumption. Well it is precisely one of IL Cosmetics’ key markets, where the group achieves 80% of its turnover in Europe. It is the market where operate the largest European retail brands. Some of our clients have seen an increase in their sales of up to more than 50% this year! Premium Beauty News - Consequently, the pace of your industrial investments has not weaken ! Eric Wimmer - It is not weakening, on the contrary it’s even accelerating. It’s no longer 11 million euros but 15 million we are about to invest in men, premises and equipments. We all know that the market cannot grow indefinitely at the same pace. However our analysis, shows that:
– we have recovered market shares since our progression is of 25% against a market progression of only 10%
– we have a important development potential in areas where we have so far not been operating insufficiently, for both historical and strategic reasons. Remember that 80% of our turnover is generated in Europe! The world is vast, and we will be in a position to explore it much more once we are ready. We firmly believe that we can only sustain our business growth if we control it. This is why we have tried to avoid spreading our markets geographically but also our production sites. All our production sites are in different buildings, isolated from one another, but they are all located at Bettembourg, a commune in southern Luxembourg. This helps us take full advantage of all synergies available between the different teams and equipments! What I can tell you is that we are soon going to have available a additional built area of 5000 m2 at the same location of our factory in Luxembourg.  For 2011, our sales forecasts in terms of progression exceed 25%!"
Rexam celebrates the 50 years of its plant in Le Tréport,"The adventure begins in May 1956 with the creation of the company Plasverre within the premises of the glassmaking company, Henry Desjonquères at Mers les Bains. However, plastic transformation starts it autonomous development at the very beginning of the 1960s, with the birth of YDEV (Yves de Vaucorbeil to replace the Plasverre entity) in the town of Eu, with the aim to bring together in one single place, three different manual assembly operations (cellophane wrapping, pumps for shoe care products, valves and push buttons). To this must be added decoration of plastic parts and moulding of rubber components. At the time, forty people are employed. The end of the 1960s is marked by the installation of the first plastic injection automatic press. In 1970, activities are centred on valves and push buttons. The new share holder changes to Saint Gobain Desjonqueres. With the new subsidiaries of the Group specializing in dedicated activity, YDEV specialises in assembly processes.   In 1980, YDEV becomes S.O.F.A.B. (Société Française d’Aérosol et de Bouchage - French company of Aerosol and Capping) and takes in charge the control of the entire capping activity of Saint Gobain Desjonqueres. As the valve, pump and cap activity is growing, it moves on to Friville-Escarbotin in 1983. In 1987, the Bic Group takes over S.O.F.A.B. for the marketing of perfumes to mass distribution markets and expands its activities to Le Tréport. Two years later, emerges a now famous product, the Sofistic’s, consisting of a 1.2ml pump bottle for the distribution of perfume samples. The 90s will record the transfer of the entire activity to Le Tréport and the development of a number of products that contributed to the site’s reputation. The ISO 9001 certification will be obtained in 2005, then Bic sells Sofab to Bowater while the construction of a site dedicated to healthcare activities is undertaken in 1999. Finally, the 2000s will see the switch to S.O.F.A.B. Rexam, and then Rexam Dispensing Systems and finally in 2002 the emergence of the healthcare activity. Launches of new products follow one after another and two separate activities - Personal Care (beauty) and Healthcare (health) - are created. The Le Tréport site now hosts the Personal Care and Healthcare activities of the Rexam Group’s Plastic Packaging Division . With over 600 employees and 4 manufacturing facilities spread over 25,000m2 - mini products, cosmetics, perfumery and healthcare - the site at Le Tréport has earned itself a reputation for its expertise in assembly and plastic injection. It is currently in France, one of the most important industrial sites in terms of injection moulding machines (over 100). In the domain of healthcare, the industrial site of Le Tréport has specialized itself in advanced dispensing systems for drugs such as spray pumps, metering valves providing a continuous flow, applicators and complete systems for ENT, pulmonary, and dermal treatments. Currently offering Class 8 clean rooms, workshops in controlled atmosphere and/or machines under laminar flow, the plant produces according to GMPs in the spirit of requirements set up by pharmaceutical companies for the drug itself and its container as well."
"Françoise Montenay, “Beauty can help achieve a better living!”","Premium Beauty News - A bit of history first... When and why did this idea of creating this association emerge? Françoise Montenay - Beauty Centres start with the CEW, a trade association for reflection and action created in 1986 and which brings together women decision makers from the Beauty world. It is itself an offshoot of the American women’s organization bearing the same name, founded in 1954. The ""C"" letter of course stands for ""Cosmetics"" (all members carry responsibilities in the beauty business, upstream or downstream from the chain that constitutes the perfume and cosmetics industry). The ""E"" letter stands for ""Executive"" (within the brands and companies serving the beauty industry, and at different levels of management, its members take a part in the creation, spreading and influence of Beauty in France and across the world). Finally, the ""W"" letter stands obviously for ""Women"" since all members are women and what women! By offering free beauty treatments within hospitals, our Beauty centres offer a interlude of serenity and comfort through the remarkable work achieved by beauticians. This allows patients to ""come to terms"" with their image and fight better against illness. Note that in addition to Beauty treatments, we have set up olfactory workshops in several hospitals and CEW volunteers (neurological rehabilitation, adult oncology, geriatrics) by specialists of olfaction and with the support of the IFF (International Flavours and Fragrances). By using a variety of odours, patients who have suffered various injuries find the way back to their memory (""Smell to Remember"") or to taste. Premium Beauty News - What kind of care is provided? Françoise Montenay - Since the creation of Beauty Centres in 1992, the number of care offered is steadily increasing. (facial hair removal, nail polish, make-up, manicure etc ...). And the most popular care are manicure, pedicure, massage, make-up beauty tips... Premium Beauty News - What are the next steps for the Beauty Centres and the CEW? Françoise Montenay - Actions undertaken by Beauty Centres can only increase. We have many projects under way and a large number of requests. Like any organization, we obviously need funds. I take this opportunity to thank all our donors for the invaluable help they offer us every year. And I can only invite all men and women who want to contribute to this exciting, rewarding and restorative task to join us. Concerning the CEW, as you know, we often hold events in the form of round tables, meetings or debates in a spontaneous manner, like for example, a ""brands-creators-distributors"" round table to explore avenues on the future of perfume, or of meetings on the occasion of an event such as, June last, MakeUp in Paris, where our members were delighted by their visit to the show and its make-up animation performed by the make-up artist Max Herland. Our next debates will focus on make-up and beauty on the web. Premium Beauty News - Next year will mark the 25th anniversary of the Association. Françoise Montenay - Yes absolutely! The highlight of this event will be the organization in June 2011, during the second or third quarter, of a big meeting in Paris, which will give us a chance to honour women who have marked the profession and put forward our image of women leaders who have an opinion on the future of our industry and share it."
Beauty Success targets 10% market share in France,"Beauty Success, the third network of selective perfumery in France with regards to the number of points of sale, behind Marionnaud and Nocibé, and the fifth as regard as purchasing capacity, is confirming its dynamism. The company has recorded an increase of its turnover by 5.8% in the first quarter of 2010 (7,2% as at August 31, 2010), against an overall market growth of 3%. It should be remembered that in 2009 the company had performed the strongest growth of its sector with a turnover up by 7.17%, against a market declining by -1.4%. [1] Philippe Georges, CEO and co-founder of the retail network, intends to continue on this dynamic. First step: a new visual identity, along with a new signature, unveiled last May. The next phase was to be presented to the network of franchise partners at the company’s 16th National Convention which was held in Cannes from the 20th to 23rd of September 2010.  After the front shops are put in line with the new visual identity, the network is actually planning an evolution in the concept of its outlets. “We are going to conduct some tests to review the layout of the outlets, this project will be stated in 2011,” explains Philippe Georges. The dynamism of the brand reflects itself in the continued expansion of its network which can now rely on 260 perfumeries [2] among which 2/3 of franchises. Fourteen new stores were opened during the first semester (including 10 franchises) and we should continue on the same trend, allowing the network to approach 270 outlets by the end of the year. According to its CEO, ultimately, the potential of Beauty Success is of 400 outlets in France in order to reach its 10% market share target. Proximity positioning is the main reason to this success. The network is in fact primarily located in small towns generally neglected by other competitors. The company has even developed a new store format, the ‘Boutiques Beauty Success’, specially designed for catchment areas of 15000 to 25000 inhabitants. “This allows us to maintain or create the distribution of prestige cosmetics in areas where they no longer existed or had never existed.” While a traditional Beauty Success perfumery has a sales area of 100m2 and retails at least 50 to 150 brands (i.e. 6,000 to 12,000 references), the format of ’Boutiques Beauty Success’ comprises outlets with a sales area starting at 50 m2 and retailing 12 to 20 brands (i.e. 2,500 to 5,000 references). A smaller store format which nonetheless does not neglect customer service.  “Each of our outlets, including shops, offer cosmetic treatments. This is essential, especially in areas where no other offer exists,” underlines Philippe Georges. Similarly, whatever the size of the outlet, the company strives to present a balanced offer between popular brands, thus ensuring store attractiveness, and smaller brands that allow differentiation and create a brand spirit, with sometimes regional variants, when a quality offer of local products exists, like for example in Brittany. “Our results are the consequence of the recognition of the service we provide to consumers. We have exceeded the two million threshold of loyalty card holders. It is also the consequence of local and individual investment of each of our partners, and the result of collective work within the company. Not forgetting, of course, the effects of our implementation strategy, marked by the diversity of our locations: downtown, shopping centres, rural areas and seaside resorts.”  Philippe Georges believes, that in fact, all this is perfectly expressed in the new visual identity of Beauty Success.  “A good-humoured atmosphere, well-being and even happiness that we aim to provide our customers with, through welcoming, our services and advice given.” As part of the development of its services, Beauty Success will launch its online store at the end of the year, with the main objective of attracting new customers to its outlets.  “The advantages of an online store, with 24 hours a day and 7 days a week accessibility and availability, should enable us to continue to retain existing customers and win new ones. But the website was primarily designed as a recruitment tool to serve points of sale.” Beauty Success already has a perfume shop in Tahiti and one in Reunion, and 7 outlets in Morocco as part of a master franchise. International development of the brand is clearly in focus, even though if for the time being its CEO considers it is still too early to give an appropriate answer. “We know we will be in demand because our model may be relevant in some countries. So we are starting to prepare ourselves internally for this eventuality, but we do not yet have structures to take that step. Having said that, we will soon be able to put ourselves to work.” On this subject, as on others, people at Beauty Success known how to keep feet on ground.  “To expand overseas means to adapt to different practices, different cultures and different expectations. It does not just happen.”  Nothing in the short term, therefore, but the teams at Beauty Success are learning and are preparing themselves."
Arcade sets foot on foreign shores,"First step for Arcade, the South American continent where it produces, since the beginning of this year, some of its technologies in Sao Paulo.  Then will come the turn of Asia, with a new implantation to come. Arcade is the company who invented in the mid-1980s, the famous ScentStrip®, a system, in theory so simple, consisting in partly applying fragrance on the flap of a sheet of paper using the microencapsulation technique.  A fantastic promotional tool to release perfumes in the form of an insert in newspapers around the world was born! In just a few years, the turnover of Arcade will explode. But engineers at the American firm had no intention of stopping there as they launched, over the following years, equally clever systems such as DisCover®, LiquaTouch®, Beautiseal®, Kiss-A-Peel®, LipSeal® and most recently ClearTouch™. ""Of course,” explains Philippe Ughetto, Senior Vice President International, ""the more we find new products, the more people envy us! But it is very difficult to copy us on the register of quality."" ""We have become over the years the champions of full service. We are entrusted with the entire project. We take in charge, design of course, printing of the insert, the card or the sleeve, the sample manufacturing, the encapsulation and/or filling and, above all, the perfect positioning of the product on its medium. A medium which must also fully integrate itself in the manufacturing line of magazines worldwide and insure perfect product rendition.""  A real technical challenge where dozens of technical processes and manipulations come into play. To achieve this, Arcade currently owns two plants in the United States, which together employ 270 people, and several industrial partners who, for Europe, are involved either in printing the medium, or in applying the final touch to the product (filling and/or labelling/positioning and finishing). Major customer markets are, the perfume industry and then the cosmetic/make-up industry. ""A expanding segment, of course,"" admits Philippe Ughetto, “but particularly challenging and competitive where we need to be constantly creative."" Latest idea which has emerged this year, the Interactive Sampling, a very clever system allowing perfume and cosmetic companies, through a dedicated website, to offer their customers the possibility to directly order via Internet samples of perfumes or cosmetic products. To be continued ..."
The Body Shop wants to get closer from the market,"Premium Beauty News - What does The Body Shop represent today? Alexander Borwitzky - The Body Shop’s designated core businesses are cosmetics and body care, though the main focuses are the classic bath and body products. The company operates over 2,500 retail stores worldwide in more than 60 countries through franchise or fully owned shops. In Germany, The Body Shop runs 83 company-owned stores and 11 franchise shops. The Body Shop defines itself as the leading nature-inspired and ethical beauty company. Premium Beauty News - What would you define as your main assets in the current economic climate in Europe? Alexander Borwitzky - Firstly, The Body Shop as a manufacturer’s brand with its own retail store chain has the benefit to directly communicate with its customers. Our retail staffs are the best ambassadors of the brand and they are able to convey our value system into the market. This is a big factor of success and an advantage in comparison to classic manufacturer’s brands that cannot draw upon direct customer contact. Secondly, the so-called “truthful difference,” that our company represents.  The Body Shop is motivated and powered by the ideas of Anita Roddick, its founder.  Since more than 30 years, the company has shown a highly successful combination of an effective business model through its ethical value system.  The Body Shop’s values and commitments - i.e. the combination of innovation, high quality, fair price-performance ratio, inspiration from nature and a strong social commitment - mark our difference in the competitive environment. For instance, 100 % of our bottles are made from “post-consumer-recycled” material. And, wherever possible, The Body Shop avoids secondary packaging. This is what customers observe and appreciate. Premium Beauty News - Marketing processes also need to be adapted? Alexander Borwitzky - Actually, The Body Shop’s marketing structures are being decentralized.  Our aim is to be as close as possible of the market. As far as pricing and product portfolios are concerned, the decision level will be located in several decentralised specific regional-markets.  We are organizing ourselves according to small market clusters, such as Germany and Austria. Of course, The Body Shop remains a global brand with centralised product development and marketing strategies, but the implementation of these strategies has to be managed and adapted as close as possible from the customer. Premium Beauty News - Your latest launches seem to be marked by a greater sophistication of the offer.

Alexander Borwitzky - The Body Shop concentrates on becoming even more innovative. Especially mentionable is the new product series: Nutriganics. It is an Ecocert-certified, complete, natural skin care range for the thirty-something designed to fight the first signs of ageing (around 15 euros per product). We also launched a new type of products in the segment of antiperspirants.  The innovative DeoDry series were developed without any aluminium salts!  They are based on a naturally occurring volcanic mineral (Perlite), which guarantees a very high effectiveness. Premium Beauty News - What are your main expectations for the coming months? Alexander Borwitzky - As far as Germany retail sales are concerned, we expect a stimulation of the economic situation within the second half of 2010. Our key target is to expand our network and to open new shops. We already open 4 new stores in Germany and 6 other should open by the end of 2010. In addition, the company has successfully started online sales through the www.thebodyshop.de.  This new distribution channel make The Body Shop becomes accessible to customers living in areas where the opening of new shops wouldn’t be economically reasonable. The Body Shop is also testing sales in pharmacies in Germany. Our aim is to increase the penetration rate of the world’s leading nature inspired and ethical beauty brand."
Lipstick and lipgloss help Aircos extend its offer,"Premium Beauty News - If we quickly go back over the main stages of Aircos’ growth, the whole only dates back to fifteen years. Éric Merville - Actually, Aircos’ activity dates back to more than 40 years but it’s only in the early 2000s that the company takes its current form around three core activities, namely: injection in our site of Ardon (130km South of Paris), formulation with two laboratories, one in Boulogne Billancourt (suburbs of Paris), and the other one in Romorantin (170km South of Paris) and manufacturing and packaging, also in our factory of Romorantin. As a matter of fact, it is through these three perfectly mastered activities that we are able to offer a truly customized product. Premium Beauty News - Consistent investments were required? Éric Merville - Approximately 500,000 euros per year on average, excluding large industrial investments such as the updating of the site in Romorantin, in January 2OO9, at a cost of some two million euros. But it was worth it!   In eight years, the staff of Aircos jumped from 75 employees to 150! The turnover which had already reached €11 million in 2008 will be nearing €17 million this year! Premium Beauty News - Even so your company is evolving in a harshly competitive environment? Éric Merville - Yes, but there is no secret. Our customers are paying more and more attention to market changes and their brand positioning. In this regard, they need industry experts. This is the reason why our core business is focused on cosmetics by developing a tool suiting their needs. The production unit in Ardon is air conditioned and automated. The factory hosts 35 state-of-the-art injection moulding machines, including 3 dual-injection. But we can also design and implement in-house specific machines and automated systems to continually improve the site’s performance. This industrial building which is ISO 9001:2008 certified includes marking operations and has a clean room to design ""pollution protected"" parts. Our formulation laboratories in Boulogne-Billancourt and Romorantin enable us optimal responsiveness in our proposals. And we continue to invest in this area to strengthen our skills and our ability to respond. We can manage a project from its first concept to its most advanced design. Our integrated analysis laboratory enables us to manage all microbiological testing, we can thus guarantee independence and responsiveness. Finally, our new factory in Romorantin, which is ISO 9001:2008 certified, GMP compliant, currently under Ecocert approval with an OTC production area allows us to perform all types of filling, our industrialization team designs in-house automated systems to optimize our packaging process. This plant has a production and packaging capacity of over 110 million units/year. Premium Beauty News - A area where one must constantly innovate? Éric Merville - Innovation has always been the driving force in Aircos’s development, the R & D department which is integrated, has two main functions: conduct studies applied to customer specifications, but also identify and anticipate changes required for the future of our profession. With a reinforced R & D team, we are in a position to work on tomorrow’s textures and colours. In September we will invite our customers to discover our 2011/2012 autumn-winter ranges. They are called ""System 80"", ""Requiem"" and ""Ultra Glam."" And, as you know, lipsticks and lipgloss are entering our cosmetic range as of this autumn. Premium Beauty News - A real ""full service"" business? Éric Merville - This them, which is haphazardly addressed by many people, encompasses realities we have been dealing with for years: actually in the field of make-up, we master all its components. This mastery allows us to offer our customers  full product responsibility. Brands need strong answers to meet market demand: cases, pallets, jars ..., Our teams know how to come up with appropriate solutions for the projects they have been entrusted with. The combination of our know-how enables us to perform multi-product pallets, in addition, thanks to our experience in the field of injection, a number of assembly are processed automatically. We have what it takes to be full-service specialists and it is clearly a cornerstone in the development of Aircos for the years to come. Premium Beauty News - And what are the next steps? Éric Merville - Broaden our lines of products, as I told you. But also expand our influence abroad. Exports only accounts for 20% of our business. Which is not enough."
"“We want Brazil to be our second market,” Anna Chaia, (L’Occitane Brazil)","Premium Beauty News  - What are your expectations regarding the development of L’Occitane’s business on the Brazilian market? Anna Chaia - By July we opened 10 stores in Brazil, where we are now totalling 55 stores (15 franchises and 35 own), but by the end of our fiscal year in March 2011, we will have 70 stores. Our goal is to triple the size of the company in Brazil within 2-4 years.  We’re more accessible than Dior or Clinique but more expensive than Natura and Boticario.  Actually, we hardly have any direct competitor.  We’re accelerating our investment in the country, hence demonstrating that we really believe in Brazil. Premium Beauty News  - In contrast with the recent downturns of the European and US markets, Brazil showed a double-digit growth rate in 2009. Does that mean your company will heavily invest on this market? Anna Chaia - Yes. We will begin investing in the team – in particular in the management and in store staff training. We recently moved our office in Sao Paulo, which has a training centre for our stores.  Additionally, about 80% of the leadership team was renewed. The second important investment will be in the media, mainly printed media, both magazines and newspapers. We have selected Ogilvy to be our partnering media agency in Brazil. Premium Beauty News  - Retail outlets are also receiving increased attention. What about your strategy in this area? Anna Chaia - Today L’Occitane is targeting the A and B classes.  Indeed we want to conquer the consumer of the B class in Brazil and our expansion plan is extending to secondary cities such as Londrina, Joinville, Caxias do Sul, Salvador, Campinas, with a third store, Belo Horizonte, where we have plans to open a third store too, Fortaleza, with the opening of a second store.  We have opened or fifth store in Rio de Janeiro.  Recently, we have reopened a new store at Sao Paulo’s Shopping Iguatemi, and we are about to inaugurate a store at Centre Norte, and another at Shopping Tambore. In the coming years, we plan to open new retail channels through franchises and authorized stores, but also e-commerce and pharmacies.  We are experiencing a high speed expansion pace. Retail is our DNA, combined with the expertise in beauty. We have implemented a training program for or sales teams to offer a personalized service for customers of our 55 stores across the country.  L’Occitane currently has the lowest rate in staff turnover  (9%) in the retail business.  Shop assistants and back-office staff benefit from career plans, as well as bonuses. Premium Beauty News  - In which Latin American countries does L’Occitane also operate? Anna Chaia - As far as Latin America is concerned Brazil is our only subsidiary, and we work with distributors in Argentina, Colombia and Ecuador. The idea is that Brazil becomes our bridgehead for the southern cone, within the next 3-5 years. Premium Beauty News  - Is there any outlook for L’Occitane to build a factory in Brazil? Anna Chaia - No. In the short term it is unlikely. The products are manufactured in Manosque, in Southern France. The ingredients come from the same region, and it is very difficult for the company to replicate this consistent structure. As a consequence, 100% of our products sold in Brazil are imported.  Of course, we therefore have to pay customs tariffs, varying according to product categories."
Pola to enter Indian skin care market,"As other leading Japanese cosmetics groups, Pola is developing its business outside its home market with a focus on emerging markets.

Stölzle upgrades its English factory,"Carried out over the last eighteen months in the teeth of the recession, this upgrade has introduced state-of-the-art decoration machinery and increased by over 50% the size of the decoration facility; installed a new furnace, and a brand new Customer Centre. Johannes Schick, Stölzle Glass Group (STO) CEO and Chairman of the Board of Stölzle Flaconnage Ltd details for Premium Beauty News the main assets of the Group’s new strategy. Premium Beauty News - The Knottingley site has a long history? Johannes Schick - A long history indeed! Glass has been made on the same Knottingley site for over 130 years, and Yorkshire glass making dates back to the seventeenth century. The area originally provided everything that was needed for glass production: coal for power, raw materials and both canal and rail transport. In the nineteenth century it attracted a number of glass producers. In 1871 a bottle factory was founded in Knottingley by two cousins of the Bagley family. Over nearly a century, a number of changes occurred in the Bagley Company, including the production of a range of decorative glass that is now highly collectable. Then in 1962 Bagley’s was taken over by the Jackson Glass Company of Knottingley. In turn, Jackson’s became part of the Rockware Glass Company. In 1994 the Bagley factory was acquired by Stölzle Oberglas AG of Austria, who formed a subsidiary company, Stölzle Flaconnage, which began production in 1995. Over the years modern techniques have been added to the traditional glass making skills. Today, Stölzle Flaconnage has around 300 employees and specialises in the production of glass containers for high-end spirits, perfumery and personal care. The company has a reputation for high quality flint, or clear, glass, and, on two of its production lines, for Feeder colour. Originally operating with four lines of IS single and double gob machines, a fifth production line was added in 2008 to meet rising demand. By the end of 2008 all five lines were working to near capacity. Premium Beauty News - It’s also concerning decoration that significant investments were achieved? Johannes Schick - By the end of 2008 it was clear that, in order to attract a greater market share, the decoration facility required major investment. It not only needed state-of-the-art machines but also a complete reorganisation of the layout. This was the point at which the global financial crisis began to impact and forced the reduction of bottle production. However, the decision was taken to continue the planned investment in the decoration facility Acquisitions and installations in the decoration facility include: 
– A new annealing lehr,
– Techno 6-colour automatic printing machine,
– Two spray machines capable of spraying 28 bottles per minute,
– Automatic etching machinery, which provides a high quality finish with highly competitive pricing,
– A hot foil stamping system,
– Heat release transfer for multi-colour decals. In addition to the new machines, in order to meet the latest legislation on reductions in smoke particulate levels, and to anticipate future legislation, it was necessary to install a new chimney with filter, another major investment. The installation was effected during the summer of 2008. Prestige glass is all about visual quality. The cold end of the glass production area has been extended to allow for the introduction of an additional number of automated checking machines, thus increasing quality control. The decoration facility has also been greatly expanded. Premium Beauty News - A new furnace has also been installed? Johannes Schick - The expansion and modernisation of the decoration factory took four months. After completion, a major site upgrade of the glass moulding factory and administration areas was instigated. This has included the building of a 150 ton new furnace. The construction of the new furnace took 42 days over the Christmas period and entailed the closing down of all production. The new furnace was fired up on the 4th January 2010. Soon all five production lines were once again in operation. The IS machines operate with a combination of double and single gob, producing between 55,000 and 100,000 bottles per machine per day. Annual capacity for the factory is 81 million pieces. The final part of the site upgrade was the creation of a modern Customer Centre where clients can discuss design, production and decoration possibilities and view samples of STO’s output Premium Beauty News - An upgrading which obviously took into account environmental constraints! Johannes Schick - Absolutely, during the upgrade, the environmental aspect of all the developments has been carefully considered. Stölzle Flaconnage has always recycled its own waste glass in its production, a certain percentage increases the malleability of the moulding process. In order to preserve the clarity of the glass, the amount and source has always been strictly controlled. The company is currently carrying out a major investigation into an industrial re-integration of waste glass in bottle production that will utilise a wide range of waste glass to produce an acceptable cosmetic flint glass. Premium Beauty News: The Group has opened two new sales offices? Johannes Schick - Two new sales offices were opened this year, one in Beauvois en Cambresis in France, and the other one in New Jersey, USA. These have joined the existing offices in Vienna and Moscow. Altogether, STO services clients from more than eighty countries."
Jackel joins the Li & Fung Group,"Actually, by taking over the Jackel group, the Li & Fung group, does more than reinforce its strategy for a total control of the supply chain in the beauty sector. Li & Fung has already dramatically strengthened its position in the cosmetics industry with the buyout of Hong Kong based Cgroup Ltd a few months ago, then with the creation of LF Beauty - specialized in promotional items and packaging, point-of-sale advertising and full-service.  But with Jackel, it acquires an industrial tool located in Southern China, near Hong Kong, where managers from Jackel had already heavily invested in recent years. Indeed, the Jackel Group is running no less than 6 plants in China including two fully owned plants a few hours drive from Hong Kong, one for plastic injection (PCM), the other one for filling cosmetic / perfumery products, JV Cosmetics. Li & Fung claims to be a global leader in the supply chain management, with more than 1,000 customers, US$ 14 billion in sales and over 14,000 employees operating in forty countries.  In 2007, the Li & Fung had firstly bought CGroup HK Ltd (June 2007, secondary packaging, full service, promotional items), PB Beauty, UK (August 2007, private labelling of cosmetic products), then Imagine PoS (January 2008, point-of-sale advertising) and RT Sourcing (August 2008, primary packaging). Last July, the group announced the creation of LF Beauty. Practically, LF Beauty has Sales offices in Europe (Paris, London), in the USA (New York, Dallas), and in China (Hong Kong, Shanghai), an important R&D laboratory for formulation in the UK, including product development and sourcing teams, project management and quality insurance teams for its various production facilities (Hong-Kong, ShenZen, DongGuan, Shanghai, etc…), filling units (England, China). Organized in networks, LF Beauty teams manage thousands of suppliers and industrial partners, from the product’s development to its production (where materials and components are sourced from various suppliers) and its final delivery. Furthermore, LF Beauty can take advantage of Li & Fung global network, as the group is operating in forty countries worldwide: a strong and unique asset with a sourcing sector in constant evolution. As far as it is concerned, Jackel’s business profile is consistent: US$ 130 million in sales. An industrial activity focusing on several poles, plastic, metal (zamac and aluminum), glass, surface treatment and, of course, the filling of cosmetics and ..., for the past two years, of perfume. This strategy of upstream industrial integration initiated by the Jackel Group in the early 2000s will have developed itself like clockwork. The creation of Jackel France, precisely in 2000, and its exponential growth had surely something to do with it considering the healthy order backlog for packaging and requests  to come in ""full service"" from the French Beauty industry. With the takeover of Jackel, the Li & Fung group will be controlling directly or indirectly (factories of business partners) not only an important industrial tool in plastics, metal, surface treatment and to a lesser extent glass, but above all a powerful tool in perfumery and cosmetics formulation and filling. Jackel’s Full Service activity had begun in 2003 in the United States with the Elizabeth Arden Group, and then Victoria’s Secret and Coty. The industrial integration in the filling segment in 2006 with the buyout of JV Cosmetics boosted this activity. The plant can process both cosmetics, personal care products, perfume and OTC products. Regarding make-up, Jackel offers a full range of forty formulas including a ""standard"" range, ""les Classiques"" a ""mineral"" range, ""Les Minérales"". Main customer markets, the United States and Europe. Jackel’s buy out is part of seven deals that Li & Fung recently signed in particular in the fashion and fabrics industry.  “The deals will further solidify our market share in their respective areas and will contribute positively to our bottom-line in the long run,” said Mr. Bruce Rockowitz, President of Li & Fung (Trading) Limited."
LVMH growth will come from Brazil too,"LVMH - Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy - the world’s leading manufacturer and retailer of luxury products, has reached an agreement to acquire a 70%, controlling stake in Sack’s, the leading online retailer of fragrances, cosmetics and toiletries and one of the leading company in the whole specialty beauty distribution sector in Brazil. The acquisition of Sack’s will mark Sephora’s entry into the Brazilian perfumes and cosmetics market, one of the largest and fastest-growing beauty markets worldwide. In 2009, while the world was still struggling with the consequences of the financial crisis, the Brazilian market grew by 16%, according to the ABIHPEC, the Brazilian Toiletry, Perfumery and Cosmetic Association, who also forecasts a double-digit growth for the next five years. “Brazil and, to a larger extent, South America are very promising countries for luxury goods. LVMH has been present there since 1973 and holds a leadership position in prestige beauty as well as in other segments of the luxury market. The opportunity is formidable,” commented Antonio Belloni, Group Managing Director of LVMH. Sack’s will serve a springboard to Sephora, the chain retailer of high-end cosmetics, which is owned by LVMH, to develop its local business, online and over time in stores. “Sephora, which is the leading online beauty retailer in the USA, will bring its experience, acquired in international markets and online beauty retailing, to help develop Sack’s business and increase its penetration among Brazilian beauty shoppers,” says LVMH. Mail and online orders are important retail channels for cosmetics in a country such as Brazil.  It is the preferred channel of leading Brazilian cosmetics makers, Natura or O Boticário. Founded in 2000, Sack’s carries over 270 brands, including the most famous ones, and its client portfolio comprises more than 830,000 customers. Sack’s is one of the top-three most frequently accessed pureplay e-commerce sites in Brazil, with 4 million unique visitors each month. Mr. Carlos André Montenegro, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Sack’s and his partners, Albatroz Participações and Mr. Marcelo Franco, will continue to hold a 30% stake in Sack’s. According to LVMH, the current management team, led by Mr. Montenegro, will remain in place and Sack’s will continue to be based in Rio de Janeiro."
Shiseido’s fragrance division to distribute Annick Goutal in the USA,"Paris-based Annick Goutal Parfums and Beauté Prestige International (BPI), the US arm of Shiseido’s fragrance division, have entered into a multi-year agreement for the marketing and distribution of Annick Goutal’s scents and skincare products. The US market has always been Annick Goutal’s first export market, with a very selective distribution.  The brand is currently carried in several prestige-level department stores in the US, including Barney’s, Bergdorf Goodman, Bloomingdale’s, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom and Saks Fifth Avenue.  “BPI’s proven strategy of growing distinctive, high-end fragrance brands in limited distribution channels seems a natural fit for Annick Goutal Parfums, and we are well-positioned to maximize the brand’s significant potential in the US market,” says Nicholas Munafo, President of Beaute Prestige International USA. The new distribution agreement will be effective as of July 1st, 2010.  Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed."
"Misha Riveros-Jacobson, Rexam Personal Care:  “We have the broadest offer of the market!”","Premium Beauty News - To start with, tell us more about the Personal Care division! Misha Riveros-Jacobson - Formed in 2007, this division is primarily a supplier of packaging solutions with a worldwide production capacity. It is the business partner o many cosmetic products manufacturers (perfumes, care) and in hygiene and household products. It is one of the three business units under the Rexam Plastic Packaging umbrella. It focuses on three markets: Cosmetics, Toiletries and Household Care. The turnover of Rexam Plastic is about 1.2 billion UK pounds, equally split between the three divisions: Personal Care, Healthcare, Closures. The Personal Care division is one of the market leaders in perfume and lotion pumps and closures for perfumes and cosmetic creams. We are also the leader in the field of perfume and lotion samplers and in non-aerosol foam pumps. We are leaders in lipstick cases, and second in make-up cases. As for Household Care applications we are the leading manufacturer of custom high volume products with special expertise in innovative package design and engineering, multi-shot moulding, in-mould labelling and a full range of value-added capabilities for the global custom injection moulding business. Our clients include prestigious brands such as Procter & Gamble, L’Oreal, LVMH, Unilever and others, located throughout North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia. We have the ambition of becoming a powerful worldwide supplier of packaging solutions that builds brands while maximizing their profitability. Finally, and I probably should have started there, we are of course part of the Rexam group. whose turnover is around £ 4.8 billion, with a staff of 22,000 across 105 manufacturing facilities in more than 20 countries. Premium Beauty News - On your arrival at the head of the Personal Care Division, what were your observations and the options you chose? Misha Riveros-Jacobson - Immediately, it became clear to me that we possessed a unique industrial asset, consisting in the offer of global and integrated technologies that met the needs of our three markets. We must therefore take full advantage of this tool and transversally maximize technology synergies in order to fully satisfy our clients operating in one or more markets. It is no longer a matter of just selling the pump, or the closure or just make-up..., it’s actually a question of understanding and taking into consideration the individual needs of our clients in order to offer them global solutions meeting their expectations on their favourite markets. This new market approach has led to a re-organization of our sales teams by clients. In order to provide them with a global offer of technologies, a single privileged interlocutor is chosen to meet their different needs in their different markets. The last point being that we needed to innovate more and capitalize on our Research Centre in Chicago, which remains a perfect example of its type, to develop with our clients innovative packaging solutions. Innovation is the driving force behind our business and we have continued to offer innovative solutions to our clients. For example the launches Glossy Days, a new collection of eight patented lip gloss applicators, each of them featuring its own visual and tactile advantages.
In addition, we have just showcased our Nea Airless at Luxe Pack New York. Premium Beauty News - A few words about this new Airless. Misha Riveros-Jacobson - In anticipation of increasing demand for lotion dispensers providing high-performance protection, Rexam relied on its dual expertise concerning neutral pumps and airless pack for the launch of the new standard Nea airless line: a pack offering dual protection for fragile formulas. The heart of the Nea Airless is the Nea engine itself, first introduced in 2008 at Luxe Pack Monaco. Designed without elastomer, the Nea atmospheric pump is fitted with a glass ball and a spring placed outside the closing chamber, which assures metal-free formula flow, complete neutrality and protection against formula discoloration and incompatibility. The pump is engineered for smooth actuation, precise dosage and high suction force to handle today’s most viscous and sensitive products. We offer this new airless solution in a 30ml, 50ml and, soon, 15ml version and two designs (large, lockable actuator, with- or without cap), and with global, end-to-end, support and service. The Nea Airless is easy to top-fill under atmospheric conditions on high-speed lines - Thanks to our patented SnapOn® technology.  Complete high-end decoration, such as hot stamping, silk screening or vacuum metallization, is available. Premium Beauty News - Your global industrial presence is obviously quit an asset! Misha Riveros-Jacobson - A very big asset, indeed! Our presence in Asia, Latin America (in particular Brazil with its fast growing economy), Europe, Central America, the United States can only help us grow significantly in our clients major markets. Premium Beauty News - Yes, but you were appointed at the worst time of an economic crisis unprecedented since fifty years. Misha Riveros-Jacobson - Personal Care was impacted by a slowdown in the fragrance and cosmetics market in both the US and Europe resulting in a significant drop in volume. The stabilization of our results in the second half was the consequence on the one hand of strong demand for foam pumps, following the H1N1 outbreak, and secondly on improved demand for lotion products as well as some new product launches as clients’ confidence returned. In general, clients worked to smaller batch sizes and shorter order commitments whilst retailers reduced stock holding and expected suppliers to be more flexible and to be able to cope with any fluctuations in demand. We acted swiftly to the drop in demand with cost saving initiatives, including plant closures, plant restructuring, headcount reductions, salary freezes and furloughs. Premium Beauty News - In this race for excellence, Rexam Personal Care seems to have changed gear in recent months, like for example through your communication. Misha Riveros-Jacobson - I’m quite pleased this is noticeable. You’ve probably also noticed the publication of these ""infomercials"" with the first wave concerning the ""Art of Spray"" and you will very soon see the second wave on the Protection and distribution of fragile formulas. All this gives you a chance to see our desire to express ourselves on cross-cutting topics concerning issues our clients are very much aware of. Not to mention the systematic release, upon agreement of our clients, of communiqués on our achievements. We have also started attending trade shows, the next one being MakeUp in Paris."
Schwan-STABILO Cosmetics: “We are trend forecasters and advisors for pencils”,"Premium Beauty News - Schwan-STABILO Cosmetics has become a major player in the Beauty industry worldwide. Barbara Bauer-Kropf - Schwan-STABILO Cosmetics is market leader in volume and revenue (with a global market share of 40 %) for cosmetic pencils and produces around 400 million units globally.

Premium Beauty News - What do you think will be tomorrow’s main make-up trends that should drive today’s current research? Barbara Bauer-Kropf - The Schwan-STABILO group is a family-owned company with a long history. Founded in 1855, the company is now run by its fifth generation. With the first eyebrow pencil in 1927 - in the beginning surgical marker pens, the company’s expertise in writing instruments was applied to a completely new sector – cosmetics. Since then, innovative developments from Schwan-STABILO Cosmetics have consistently had an impact on the industry, for example the direct moulding process. Schwan-STABILO Cosmetics stands for innovation, product safety, quality and sustainability at a competitive price. We believe that these are the core elements the consumer and ultimately our customers are looking for. Our R&D department is permanently guided by these key values for the development of new products. Premium Beauty News - What is the annual amount of your R&D investments? Barbara Bauer-Kropf - The history of Schwan-STABILO Cosmetics has always been one of technological innovation. Today more than 120 chemists and engineers work in advanced and applied R&D to ensure Schwan’s competitive advantage. We invested EUR 9.1 million in R&D spendings during the fiscal year 2008 / 2009.  Interdisciplinary teams (packaging, formulation, pharmaceutical) works closely together and eventually joint projects have been set up with customers. Premium Beauty News - What about your international development? You have just taken over Cosmolab, what are your ambitions for this company?

Linhardt ready for the battle,"Two new Managing Directors, Monika Kopra-Schäfer since 2005, and Christian Schubert, are the successors in office, since 2009, to Walter Schlicht who retired in February 2010.  The company has reorganized itself around three poles, ""Cosmetics"" with Hans Eckhardt, ""Pharmacy"" with Sebastian Bumm and ""Food / Non Food"" with August Wanninger since 2008.  At production level was also established the ""TPM and Team Work"" concepts which involve all the actors taking part into in production from one end of the line to the other... Finally more than ever, emphasis is placed on international development and innovation. The company is strengthening its commitment in Egypt which goes back to 2007 with its local business partner (New Hover) and is also stepping up its efforts in France with the appointment, in 2009, of Philippe Rudowski to head Linhardt France. As to the ""innovation"" approach, it is paying off! In 2009, Linhardt launched its famous ""Multiflex"" tube, which was singled out the same year at the German Packaging Awards and the World Star Awards, and currently, it’s the release of the ""Orikuka"" tube, fitted with a clever protective and tamper-evident system, without forgetting the ""Dispenser Tube"", and more recently, the ""MedicPen"". “It’s true, we convey mostly a pharma image”, admits Monika Kopra-Schäfer, Managing Director, “while in fact, in percentage of sales, cosmetic products are in the lead with 41%!”  An image pertaining of course to the company’s history.  “One must remember that more than half of all aluminium tubes used for pharmaceutical purposes in Germany come from our factories,” she says. A pharma image anyway, which can only be a plus to reassure clients coming from the beauty sector, especially since the quality and cleanliness criteria are becoming more and more identical. But Linhardt is also operating in the Food industry (26% of turnover) and on the very specific segment of rigid aluminum ""cigars tubos"". A niche market which is part of the production of aluminum ""rigid containers"", workshops that managers have dynamized even more by developing a new aerosol can of a diameter of 45 through the implementation of a new production line capable of producing some 200 pieces per minute. “It’s one of the first thing we got down to”, explains Monika Kopra-Schäfer. “It was absolutely necessary to reorganize both, production and sales to be more in tune with the evolution of our customer market.” No sooner said than done… Each of the three plants became, for the first one in Viechtach, a competence centre for transforming aluminium products, the second one in Hambrücken, a competence centre for plastic and the third one in Pausa, also a aluminium competence centre. Then came the implementation of the ""TPM and Team Work ""concepts to improve productivity, where a team working on a line is responsible for the entire line. In addition, sales teams are divided into three poles, Cosmetics, Pharmaceuticals & Food / Non-Food. “It obviously a matter of hearing and understand what the market wants,” insists Monika Kopra-Schäfer. Finally, the entire company is directing its efforts toward innovation. One of the high points of these efforts was the development and marketing in 2009 of the ""Multiflex tube"" which allows, through its technical design, to cover the famous weld seam running conspicuously along the tube, hence providing 360° printing possibilities. The current production line is capable of producing about 30 million of them per year. Over the months, Linhardt’s development teams have successively developed the ""Dispenser Tube"" in partnership with the Rexam Group (including a Multiflex version to be released in the coming weeks), then it’s the roll out of the ""Orikuka"" new tube with its an ingenious protection and tamper evident device integrated to the sealed ring and cap, making it very easy to open with a simple twist of the cap. A product that will also soon be used by the cosmetic industry. Finally the MedicPen is already developed. “It’s a clever combination of an ancient technology mastered by Linhardt (that of felt markers),” explains Monika Kopra-Schäfer, “which enables us to propose a particularly efficient applicator for sophisticated medical products and with all the more reason for cosmetic products”. With an expected turnover of EUR100 million in 2010, with a workforce of 1,000 people and a production capacity of 550 million pa of aluminum tubes, 180 million pa of rigid cans, 210 million pa of plastic tubes and 30 million pa of Multiflex pipes, the German firm intends to remain among the front runners of leading European producers in aluminum and plastic flexible tubes. “To achieve this, we spend about 11 million euros per year in the production tool (approx. 10% of turnover). We also firmly believe that workforce sustainability is a strong asset we are very proud to maintain with on average, a ratio of 10% of our workforce on apprenticeship,” she says.  As for the pharma, image it will probably be less and less corresponding to the reality of Linhardt’s evolution. The cosmetics industry already representing 41% of sales, with an expected growth this year of 8%. “This is another reason why we want and we must be more present in France”, she says, “our activity in this country only accounting for 8% of sales. Our new Multiflex tube should help us.”"
Piramal Glass creates a European subsidiary,"The Indian glassmaker announces the creation this month of Piramal Glass Europe, which will be headed by Mr. Sandeep Arora. The company will be headquartered in France, 16 rue Paul Bignon in the town of Eu (in Normandy, department of Seine-Maritime), at the very heart of the so-called “glass vallée”, a cluster of companies specialising in the production of luxury glass bottles. Dominique Bonhomme will be in charge of Sales/Marketing and Development and Emilie Crusel of the logistics. An important milestone for the Indian glassmaker whose Director General, Mr. Vijay Shah, was announcing last January that “ perfumery and cosmetics already accounting for 39% of Piramal Glass’ activity would reach 55% by 2013 ”."
Schmidt & Niedermeier becomes Sun Creative Cosmetics,"The new foundation was officially done on 1st March 2010. For the manager of Rusi Cosmetic Packaging, Klaus Sindel, this recovery is consistent with a business combination of two complementary activities. Indeed, Schmidt & Niedermeier’s activity is centred at about 80% on the production of upscale lipstick tubes with a very low activity in other segments like mascara, lip gloss and eyeliner. And, precisely, the core business of Rusi Cosmetic Packaging is largely focused on these other products including 70% for mascara. ""Which means that together,"" says Omar Rizk, the new Sales Director, ""we’re probably among those in Europe who can offer the widest range of possibilities for metal / plastic processing in these segments."" First step for the buyers of Schmidt & Niedermeier, to change the name and to continue the company’s business (which had never stopped) by directing, according to them, its activity towards what it does best, namely the production of upscale metal-based or lacquered lipstick tubes. ""For the name, we already have the answer"", says Omar Rizk. ""We will now call ourselves, Sun Creative Cosmetics. As for the plant itself and its production tool, we are currently reviewing thoroughly the subject, getting rid of the obsolete equipment to keep only the top machines, be it, press transfers, injection machines or the equipment in the workshop dedicated to surface treatments or decoration”. Of the 90 people which were employed for a turnover of € 2,4 million achieved last year, only 30 people remain today with the aim of reaching € 3 million in 2010. ""We are sure"", says Omar Rizk ""that Sun Creative Cosmetics is resuming its activities just at the right time in a European market who wants to be able to rely on a real industrial know-how, close to clients, in upscale transformation of metal for the manufacture of lip sticks tubes"". The new managers at Sun Creative Cosmetics have built a five-year plan to reach the goals they have set. ""The first of these goals"", we are told at Nuremberg, ""is to be profitable at the end of 2011""."
"Intercos: formulation, nothing but formulation","“We will very quickly obliterate 2009 even if in the end concerning Intercos, we don’t have much to complain about. Our global strategy for a presence in Europe, the United States and Asia has paid off. There is a possibility for some thirty groups operating in the Beauty sector to become one day or the other one of our customers.  We already supply twenty six of them. And this is no coincidence. We bring them, innovation, mastery and powerful production output, a priceless presence on their main fields of operation worldwide. And I can already tell you that fairly quickly, we will surely be industrially operating in Brazil,"" says Dario Ferrari, Intercos’ CEO. ""As for 2010"", he underlines, ""we are certainly not expecting any miracles. It will just be an average year for our profession"". According to Dario Ferrari it’s a perfect time to keep up with standards and the new showroom set up, like every year by the teams at the headquarters of Intercos in Agrate Brianza, near Milan, is an perfect illustration. "" Our core business"", Dario Ferrari insists, ""is and will always be research, development and production of innovative, surprising and original formulas, with in particular many special effects. This is what we are emphasizing on this year. Regarding packaging, we present solutions to our customers and it is up to them to decide "". The tone is set upon entry of the showroom!  A huge fresco made of dozens of empty tumblers adorns the first welcome sign, followed a few yards further by another panel studded with clear plastic bags filled with colored powders ... A good way of reminding people who might have forgotten it that Intercos is first and foremost a fantastic machine to design formulas for make-up and skincare. And the visit we are about to begin, through a wonderful maze at the very heart of the fantastic world of color, touch and beauty, will leave us, strictly speaking, ""speechless""! ""We have established projections for 2011-2012"", explains Arabella Ferrari, Marketing Director Business Unit Colour ""based on current market and consumer trends to give women today, what they desire for tomorrow. And we propose that for women all over the world. It’s a true technological revolution based on real scientific breakthroughs that must provoke new emotion, enticing the senses and visibly enhancing skin surfaces, the whole with levels of performance never-reached before and in an unequalled world of light and colour"". – First collection showcased at Intercos’ premises in Milano:  Skin Awakening .

Colours won’t fade or set into fine lines, keeping a just applied finish at all times. ""Furthermore"", continues Arabella Ferrari ""the design and performance of each product has been subject to a 360 degrees evaluation. This universal search for beauty has resulted in the most diverse cosmetic range ever designed. Products’ characteristics in colour and performance meet the requests of each geographical market. We have categorized formulas according to the major regions, ensuring ease in selecting and identifying the perfect product for the target consumer"". Formulas for Europe Thus, for the European market, teams at Intercos worked on a large variety of concepts for the face: – the  Ideal Skin  concept for an impeccable finish and an extended comfort
–  Bronzing Dream  to dream of the sun all year round, with a healthy sun-kissed and polished complexion.
–  Naked Perfection , best breathable formulas ensuring imperceptible and weightless colour for flawless, perfected results.
–  Virtual Definition  to obtain a radiant, satin-luminous and ultra smooth skin. For lips, Intercos proposes: –  Coderouge , for a flawless lip definition, long lasting comfort and and a imperceptible lip colour that stays luminous over time.  “Classics have never been so strong,"" explains Arabella Ferrari about this segment
–  Lip Renew , a moisturizing formula combining care, colour, beauty and sophistication

For eyes:  Lash Protagonist , for longer, fuller lashes, twisted and intense, color fantasy, a graphic, sophisticated and elegant line, and  Eye Pearls , a vast interpretation of light with the twinkling reflections and metallic effects. Thus Intercos adapted its ranges to different regions, with for exemple, for the the face of North American a  Virtual Skin  for an advanced flawless finish and undetectable, skin refining light effect. And for the lips,  Rouge Warrior  for brilliant and true colour shades hour after hour. For Asian faces, Intercos proposes  Angel Skin , with a strong care attributes (pure whitening and elevated sun protection), for a flawless, lightened and brighter skin, etc. ""Quite obviously"", insists Arabella Ferrari, ""we are driven by our belief and commitment in safe and sustainable products. We make it our priority to provide products that respect the skin, which are free of irritants, parabens, and any agents that may harm environment. In this way Intercos stays in line with current and future market and consumer trends while providing the highest quality, avant garde cosmetics."""
Stölzle-Oberglas: an offensive strategy!,"Stölzle-Oberglas’ growing ambitions in the perfumery and cosmetics sector are nothing new…  ""It’s true"", explains Johannes Schick, CEO. ""But if we took our time is was mostly to upgrade our production tool. And, as you know, our industry is a heavy industry. We therefore undertook to reorganize our production tools in dedicated and well adapted sites taking advantage of a glass factory in Poland, bought in 2001 and, of course, of the other glass factory we acquired in England at Knottingley near Leeds. Today our tools dedicated to beauty are divided between Poland (1/3) and England (2/3) for automatic manufacturing but also Austria with semi-automatic processes in our Baernbach plant and, of course, always our site for nail polishes and cosmetics at Koeflach"". ""But above all"", insists Johannes Schick ""we had to reinforce our technical and commercial organization to share a Group-like offensive spirit and be as competitive as possible in the targeted perfumery and cosmetics segment, ie, masstige"". In addition to the three furnaces of 100 tons/day to 140 tons/day and the twelve production lines, the Austrian glassmaker also runs two finishing workshops in England and Poland where a lot of money was invested in recent months. ""Overall"", says Johannes Schick, ""and if you also sum up all the other investments carried out for furnaces, manufacturing equipment, cold ends and decoration workshops, our effort can be estimated at 40 million euros"". The Prestige & Beauty division will achieve this year a turnover of 70 million Euros on a total sales figure of 150 millions, including pharmaceutical activities. ""To achieve this, we can rely on five strong points"", underlines Johannes Schick: ""the fact that we are fully integrated from mold manufacturing to finishes, with over 150 people fully involved in all types of finishing techniques, a fully upgraded production tool; our ability for fast decision making; the fact we belong to a financially solid private Group and also the fact that we can offer other packaging opportunities given the strong position of the Group and of its owner, Dr. Cornelius Grupp, in the production of aerosols and flexible tubes"".

The firm based in Seoul (15 million dollars in turnover, 120 people) decided, at the instigation of Linea Glam created late 2009 by Mauro Zulianello, to intensify its marketing strategy on the old continent where it was virtually absent. ""What is important"" says Mauro Zulianello, ""is Hana’s capability for R & D. Its managers invest each year nearly 20% of the turnover. Innovation is everywhere. “ “While simple in appearance, the level of technicality is nonetheless very high in Hana’s product range"", says Christian Chirinian. Latest innovative product to date, the Dual Airless Dispenser, a particularly clever airless system with a dual compartment insuring an excellent restitution of two blended products. In fact, it’s a simple but yet very clever mechanism allowing the delivery in identical quantities of two opposite products in terms of viscosity. ""Our assets also lie in the level of customization of our products, thanks to a complete integration of all decorating, galvanizing and coloring processes"", explains Mickey Moon, Commercial Director at Hana Co., ""in airless but also lipsticks or compacts""."
LR Health & Beauty Systems reassert its double-digit growth target,"Premium Beauty News  - How do you explain your success in such a difficult economic climate? Tilo Plöger - The core businesses of LR are dietary supplements and cosmetics. In these segments LR presents itself as a retailer and a brand manufacturer with a great number of labels. In contrast to the classic trade business we don’t see any growth limits. We define five factors of success. – First of all our product portfolio paired with the quality reputation of Made in Germany goods. We are the only network-company, which manufactures mostly all products in Germany and also our major suppliers are located here.
– Secondly our portfolio international celebrities. We work closely with prominent people, we integrate them in our marketing concepts and they become an important part of it. LR and Coty are definitely the two companies which have the most celebrities under contract, especially in the range of perfumes.
– Thirdly our marketing and commission plan. We cooperate with 300,000 partners, whom are paid by our incentive system. This incentive programme sets standards in the industry, and year by year we are able to motivate many new partners to get into the act and stick to it.
– The fourth factor of success is our unique automobile concept, as a part of our incentive programme. Today, we have over 4,000 Volkswagen (Polo) and many hundreds of Mercedes Benz on the roads, and we could introduce Porsche in addition last year. Our car policy is a further point of successful implementation of the main principle Made in Germany that leads to an intense solidarity between our partners and LR.
– Last but not least our sophisticated service and education concept. The training of our partners is a top priority and one of the important factors of success, too. Premium Beauty News  - What have been your more prominent product innovations over the past 2 years ? Tilo Plöger - We operate as a brand manufacturer and concentrate on innovations and re-launches under the umbrella of our standard brands. Of course we continuously adapt and reposition our concepts in order to be better than the market benchmark. First of all, let’s mention the launch of our new line of decorative cosmetics over the past two years. We expect to sell 10,000 to 15,000 units to our partners, this would turn LR into the largest retailer of decorative cosmetics in Europe. Additionally, we have developed an all new perfume concept, not only on the qualitative scientific side in regard to a better scent adherence but also we can allocate scents to certain skin typologies and offer each costumer their optimal and tailor-made perfume. Within the scope of our celebrity concept we have developed a high selective anti age skincare range of products for men with Marcus Schenkenberg. Also, I want to note our Aloe Vera product innovations in the dietary supplement segment - a growth market par excellence. In the coming weeks we will launch novel probiotic dietary supplements (two patents) with support of  high reputed and internationally known Prof. Dr. Clancy. Furthermore, we have redesigned the whole dietary segment (concepts and formulations). Premium Beauty News  - How does an increased ecological awareness and health consciousness impact your strategy? Tilo Plöger -  Our core business is health and beauty from the in- and outside, and that’s why for us an increased ecological awareness and health consciousness is essential. We benefit from our ability to quickly readjust and optimize products very promptly. Within 18 months we remove parabens and mineral oils from all our products. Without time delay we formulate and bottle our perfumes according to the latest IFRA-guidelines. Moreover, we accomplish very strict safety assessments and tests to exclude possible cutaneous reactions and allergies. Health concerns and harmlessness of our products are our key priorities prior to ecological awareness.  We recently begun to focus on improving the sustainability of our packaging. In this matter, there are different opinions about what’s environment-friendly and what’s not. Our distribution channels allow us to go almost completely without secondary packaging. Watching packaging trends closely, we differentiate on price segments. Relating to the higher price segment we can specifically work on themes like biological degradability, carbon footprint and so on. Premium Beauty News  - What about LR in France? Tilo Plöger -  With more than 25 % of growth in 2009, LR in France becomes a major actor of the direct selling industry.  With new ranges of colour cosmetics and make-up, LR completely matches to the expectation of the French customer and French trend; for instance with the new men skincare range, “M. Schenkenberg”. France stays the country of fashion and beauty. LR is well positioning, offering as for perfume or for cosmetic middle range products but also high range products. Those can be really compared to high range products sold in the French market from high fashion houses. On the other side, the natural aspect of the product is more and more important for the French consumer today; certainly with few years late compared to Germany. This is in fact a real advantage for LR in France, because we can immediately offer high quality natural and health care products. Here we can take profit of the 25 years of experience and success of LR in Germany. In the next five years, LR in France will become a real reference in the direct selling industry. Premium Beauty News  - Please, give us an economic prospect. What do you expect from LR the upcoming 2-3 years. Tilo Plöger -  Today, we operate in about 30 countries worldwide and it is assumed that we develop one new country annually. We can anticipate - compared to our positioning in the competitive environment - a respectable two-digit growth in sales yearly. We achieved a 20 to 25 % growth the past months and expect a comparably growth rate in the future. Those challenging targets are supported by a full pipeline of innovations until the end of 2011. Additionally, we will expand existing  product groups. As said before, we don’t see any growth limits. Mainly in the dietary supplement segment the needs of customers will continue to rise to buy well explained alternatives to classic pharmaceutical health care products. Our distribution channels guarantee and include detailed explanations of our products. This service can’t be fulfilled by the classic trade business. Furthermore we think about to get in new branches of businesses which fit in LR."
Global fragrance industry reorganizes its network of associations,"Once the reorganization is complete there will be four Regional bodies under the one global IFRA brand covering North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. These four Regions will be represented on the IFRA Board as Association Members and have voting rights divided according to their respective market share. The rest of the votes will be split among companies that are currently IFRA members (Firmenich, Givaudan, IFF, Robertet, Symrise and Takasago International). As a consequence of this reorganization, national associations wishing to join will no longer have to pay dues to IFRA. The key obligation for membership will be to comply with the IFRA Code of Practice and in particular the IFRA Standards. On the other hand, they will no longer receive funds from IFRA’s member companies, who will now only fund national associations through an IFRA’s central funding mechanism for projects with global implications. “Globally the fragrance industry invests approximately USD 14 million per year across its research and association network. This realignment will concentrate resources enabling a more effective response to the growing societal, regulatory and scientific issues being faced by the modern fragrance industry,” said IFRA in a release. As part of the restructuring the European Flavour & Fragrance Association (EFFA) will concentrate exclusively on flavours.  The eight European national associations [1] have now joined IFRA as Association Members. Meanwhile the Fragrance Materials Association of the United States, better known as FMA, has formally agreed to begin doing business as IFRA North America. The next phase of the reorganization will be for the Latin American and Asia-Pacific members to formally establish their two Regional Committees completing the global branding of the regional bodies under the IFRA name and logo. “Rebranding our global association network under the IFRA name and logo will help us communicate more consistently the core values of IFRA worldwide,” said Jean-Pierre Houri, IFRA Director General."
Chromavis to acquire 100% of Durlin,"Chromavis, a world’s leading operator of B2B cosmetics and its management team are about to buy 100% of Durlin France, worldwide leader in the development and production of nail polishes and products, from Bergerac NC, a subsidiary of the French state-owned company SNPE. The agreement was signed in Paris on April13th, 2010. Chromavis, which is headquartered in Milan’s urban area, was founded in 2008 from the merging of Clavis and Gamma Croma. As far as it is concerned, Durlin France holds 56% of Durlin East Europe (headquartered in Poland) and 49% of Durlin Asia (headquartered in Thailand). The company boasts about 17 millions euros at consolidated level. The plants are located in the Bergerac area (South West of France), in Ciechanòw (Poland), and in Bangkok (Thaïland). Durlin supplies the major actors and the more prestigious brands of the cosmetics industry. “With this acquisition, Chromavis consolidates its presence in the reference market, reaching an overall turnover foreseen for 2010 of over 85 million Euros, with an Ebitda [1] of about 15 million Euros,” said the company in a release. Through this transaction Chromavis is completing its range of products to cover a wider area of the cosmetics sector.  According to Bernard Msellati, Chromavis’ CEO, the acquisition of Durlin confirms the company’s strategy to strengthen its international presence. The closing of the operation is forecasted on June 4th, 2010"
Geka carries on innovation strategy,"Premium Beauty News - What about the year 2009 for Geka? The Did the year 2010 begin in a better way? Franco Luca - 2009 went very well. Geka had a better performance compared to the market. Geka’s market share increased around 3 percent. We did very well in Central Europe and the USA. Our company’s philosophy is not to publish any figures. I can only say that in the first quarter of 2010 we achieved our targets. We are seeing again a positive trend on the market right now. Maybe the market is recovering. Premium Beauty News - What are the main events for Geka this year in terms of investments? Franco Luca - End of 2009 we invested in a new silk screening equipment. This year we will further invest in our factory in Elgin, USA to increase our capacities. Also we are investing in a lot of new products which we will present in Bologna. We are investing in labor equipment to give better consultancy and service. We want to further expand our competence in other applications than mascara. In particular in surface treatment with a new technology that enables customers to differentiate themselves and their products with the same tool at very low investment costs. Premium Beauty News - At Cosmoprof Bologna, you are going to present two new products. Franco Luca - This is true. First, the new SupremeRUBY, with clean lines, transparent material, and a practical form. It has all the characteristics of a true classic. The quality is further enhanced by the extra thick walls of the injection-moulded bottle. The 8 ml bottle is ideal for a wide variety of cosmetic formulations, mascara or lip gloss. As part of the RUBY Block Building family, the cap can be paired with the different Geka Style applicators in practically any desired combination. Premium Beauty News - And also the brand new DefinitionLINER… Franco Luca - A steady hand, some practice and the right applicator - that’s what it takes to apply eyeliner with perfection. But while nylon applicators guarantee precision, they often feel too hard on sensitive lids. Alternatively, brush applicators are soft, but using them requires some real skill. That’s why Geka created DefinitionLINER. This flocked eyeliner applicator combines the advantages of both types: soft as a brush, yet as precise as a nylon applicator, they are generally easier to use, easy to control and easy to guide. Thus, DefinitionLINER is a two-in-one applicator for pros and pros-to-be: by handling the applicator differently, users can adjust the line thickness precisely."
INCA: the philosophy of a fully integrated company,"Premium Beauty News - You are a very old Italian company that very early integrated the concept of full service.  Currently, how are you industrially structured? Sergio Faverio - The Company was established in the late 40’s in the small village of PortoValtravaglia, North-Western Italy, in the beautiful area of Lake Maggiore, next to the Swiss border of Lugano. Since the very beginning, INCA grew working on the ability to manufacture cosmetics and packaging, updating its know-how together with technologies and materials. Nowadays, INCA has developed its activity on three sites: the headquarter and the main production site are in PortoValtravaglia and it includes INCA Packaging company, specialized in the design and production of aluminum and plastic packaging, and INCA Cosmetici specialized in the production and filling of color cosmetics. There is also the French based company, Capinter, near Nantes, specialized in the production of aluminum components. Overall we can rely on over 25.000 m2 of manufacturing area, a team of over 200 people and a turnover of about 25 million euros. And yes, you are right, one of the very unique characteristic of the group is that INCA is a fully integrated company who owns in-house the majority of all the variety of production processes nowadays available in the business. This gives us a very unique knowledge and expertise. Premium Beauty News - What have been industrially speaking, the Group’s major developments during the last few years? Sergio Faverio - In the past two years INCA has focused its efforts in improving the efficiency and the rationalization of its production facilities. At the same time, both packaging and cosmetic departments, introduced new and updated production and managing processes. In addition, we improved our ability to engineer new developments in both plastic and metal processes focusing on new metal forming and plastic stamping processes, together with the use of all the most up to date materials, finishing treatments and assembly technologies. All this can be clearly identified with some of our latest developments. Some of them are already available on the market and others are currently in progress and will be launched later on this year. On the other hand and on the side of what just mentioned, following the same path, we are also installing a small production site in India, proud to be supported on this new project by a prestigious local player. The Color Cosmetic division follows the same general directions and philosophy of the Group. Lately, our ability has increased – due also to the strong demand – in the way we support the developments and the management of full-service projects meant for different business areas, from the small niches to the mass markets and private labels. Premium Beauty News - You mainly operate on European markets? Sergio Faverio - Our turnover is concentrated 50% in Italy and 50% spread between France, the rest of Europe and the USA. The French market is the reference market for our business and we are now doing consistent efforts in order to improve and increase our presence. We are very proud of the trust and confidence our clients give us. This push INCA to a continuous search for improvement, targeting quality, efficiency and customer service, always investing in innovation. Premium Beauty News - A few words on the strong points of your company in terms of new products, and about your presence at Cosmoprof Bologna! Sergio Faverio - For sure we can proudly say that we are among the best quality players in the aluminum and plastic manufacturing on the market. Having a look at our collection of customized products, the customer can understand that passion, know-how and experience are supporting us in realizing so many different articles and finishes. We are able to satisfy the latest trends of the market by developing, for example, a trendy violet surlyn cap or a wild gold lipstick case or an elegant single-block aluminum shoulder always aiming to the best quality and to a perfect functionality. Overall, we can offer such a wide range of purchasing options , from a simple collar to a perfume cap, from an empty lipstick package to a complete make-up line including bulks-formulation and filling, for market’s niches or start-ups, for mid and high-end or masstige brands and private labels. The Cosmoprof in Bologna will be a fantastic opportunity to present the INCA group and to show our latest developments."
Ancorotti Cosmetics is accelerating,"Premium Beauty News - Just a short flashback. The adventure starts in May 2009. Renato Ancorotti - It only took a few weeks to change an ordinary building situated in one of the industrial estates of Crema (Italy) to a unit at the cutting edge of technology for the mascara manufacturer. Everything went very fast thanks, of course, to our experience, but mostly to our customers confidence. May I remind you that the plant is located on a site covering 3000 m2, including 2600 m2 dedicated to production and the remaining 400 m2 serving a laboratory and sales and marketing offices. From the start, Enrica and I had anticipated our progression! And we were right! Because in spite of the crisis, Ancorotti Cosmetics nonetheless managed to make more than one million euros in turnover for mascara during the first six months, and since the beginning of 2010, our orders recorded a sharp increase and we are expecting to make nearly five million euros in turnover. Premium Beauty News - Such a progression requires equipment! Renato Ancorotti - Indeed. And here, we have what it takes. Currently our production capacity is of 1400 kg per day (140 000 pieces per day and the implementation of 5 machines) which will reach next June 1900 kg per day (190 000 pieces per day and 6 machines). And when I say ""day"", I mean ""8 hours"" production which leaves us, as you can imagine, a consistent margin of progression. And we have already planned to double our production capacity within two years with 3800 kg per day: a strike force of not less than 12 machines. The whole plant has been designed from the outset, to absorb future capacity increases. We are also currently installing on our biggest production machines an automatic system for charging raw material; this sophisticated equipment, working in a close loop, composed of carbon steel or stainless steel pipes will be operational next June. We also bought a latest generation new automatic filling line for mascaras and other liquid products which can make particularly sophisticated designs and patterns in two colors in the same container which is provoking genuine enthusiasm from our customers. Outputs for this machine are also quite impressive since it can produce on manual charge, over 24000 pieces daily in one color (i.e. 50 pieces per minute) and 5000 bicolor pieces daily and when on automatic charge and for a single color, performances are increased to 38000 pieces daily (80 parts per minute). Last but not the least, an assembly machine multi pack (5000 pieces) and a labelling machine (8000 to 12000 pieces depending on sizes). Premium Beauty News - In the coming months and more particularly at Cosmoprof Bologna and MakeUp in Paris, what novelties do you plan unveiling? Enrica Ancorotti - We would like to save the surprise for our customers for these two events, knowing that we’ll introduce new textures and new finishes derived from new technologies."
Shiseido taps into professional hair market in China,"Shiseido is commencing sales of professional hair products in Shanghai and Beijing via its wholly owned subsidiary, Shiseido China Co.  The Japanese cosmetics giant is proposing two brands to China’s hair salons: the Shiseido Professional brand, which is currently marketed by Shiseido in Japan, Asia and Oceania; and the Joico brand, which is marketed by Shiseido’s wholly owned subsidiary, Zotos International, in the United States. Shiseido is aiming for approximately 700 hair salons for these products in the two cities of Shanghai and Beijing by the end of 2010 and plans to expand to 2,500 hair salons by 2014. Shiseido is considering the professional business as the second pillar of its growth in China, after cosmetics.  The company - which aims to increase its international operations to 50% of its turnover by 2017, against 35% currently - wants to become “a global player representing Asia with its origins in Japan.  China is obviously a key marketplace for the success of this strategy, and Shiseido is working to strengthen its China business by targeting an average annual growth rate of 20%. The cosmetics market in China is anticipated to reach about 200 million cosmetics users in 2015, from 100 million in 2010. Needs are expected to increase simultaneously, further accompanying the desire to make oneself look more beautiful in all aspects from skincare and makeup to hairstyles. Earlier in March, Shiseido has launched its new DQ brand in drugstores in China as a “third sales channels” after department stores and cosmetics specialty stores and is aiming 600 outlets for the brand in 2010. Shiseido now intends to tap into professional hair segment and to establish a solid presence in high-end and luxury hair salons.  The Japanese company will promote its research on Asian hair and also intends to disseminate information of hairstyle trends originating from Tokyo and as well as training programs for hair stylists. The professional segment accounted for 7% of Shiseido’s overall sales in Japan and overseas in the fiscal year ended March 2009, which is second in size after the cosmetics business. According to Shiseido, the market for professional hair products in China was estimated to JPY 90 billion (EUR 725 million / USD 972 million) in 2007 with one million salons, and the segment is maintaining an average annual sales growth of 10%, which is roughly on par with the cosmetics market. Shiseido claims to place emphasis on the steady development of brands rather than on rapid salon expansion. In order to providing training and educational programs to hair stylists, the company has established Shiseido Beauty Studios in Shanghai and Beijing in November 2009.  The studios offer Shiseido’s original hair stylist training program, including education on hair-related theories and a follow-up of basic techniques, while also aiming to strengthen hairstyle proposal capabilities as well as to develop the spirit of Japanese omotenashi (hospitality)."
G. Pivaudran signs the packaging of Hermès’ latest fragrance,"Premium Beauty News - We will soon be able to count European metal converters of the Beauty industry on the fingers of one hand? Marc Pivaudran - It is true that crisis has done deep damage, probably irreversible for some of us. We’ve had our share but we are pulling out of it. This drop of almost 50% between 2008 and 2009 was unimaginable. As you know, we had to reduced our workforce to 180 people on two production sites in Souillac (stamping and surface treatment/assembly) while keeping our expertise. The U.S. market has been in the past a tremendous powerhouse for the development of G. Pivaudran representing up to 50% of our activity (30% today!), but the crisis on the continent has obviously impacted us more than others. Premium Beauty News - Is crisis the only factor responsible this drop in the metal industry concerning beauty packaging? Marc Pivaudran - No, of course. It is clear that we have been subject as everyone else, for several years, to a slow but increasing erosion of our margins under the pressure of a customer market always demanding better price conditions. Asian competitor are obviously not helping us. And our industry is always asking for more investment and technology. Transfer presses, and with all the more reason, the lines for surface treatment are expensive and quality has a price. And in any case, must be paid for! Not to mention the compulsory investment in terms of environment which led us for example to equip ourselves, early 2009, with a machine capable of achieving double anodizing treatments in optimum environmental conditions. Premium Beauty News - A fine example of quality product that design for Hermes is! Marc Pivaudran - Quite true, a fine example! May I remind you that it is a glass bottle dressed with a very thick metal stirrup. To achieve this We had to push aluminum to its very limits during the press forming process, but also adapt and develop associated surface treatments which are polishing and anodizing. This beautiful object is a true novelty, in terms of design but also by the gestural, and we are extremely proud to be associated to it with our partner IPack. Premium Beauty News - Is metal still in fashion? Marc Pivaudran - If you have a look into our order book for the months to come, undoubtedly yes! I think our growth this year will be over 30% and we have a number of new projects. This restart is accompanied with the arrival of a Director of Operations and Continuous Improvement, who took office mid-March. I must also say that our ""innovation"" process has never slowed down and we have some concrete things to offer our customers who are of course very eager to take advantage of.
By the end of the year, we will be able to show some of these leads, especially for surface treatments and new technologies for material deformation."
Regi: a new factory in august 2010,"According to Vittoria Cicchetti, CEO of Regi International, whose turnover has seen since 4 years a 20 to 30% constant yearly growth,  building a new factory “is another vital step in the development of Regi in order to meet increasingly growing customer demand.” The yet recent current plant, that produces bulk and which also includes the R& D laboratory and offices, and another factory near Crema for conditioning and powder compaction, are already not sufficient to meet demand. Furthermore, the operation will enable the firm to group all its activities on a single location. Especially as the ""full service"" activity is in constant growth and requires the installation of new complete lines. Founded in 1994 by Vittoria Cicchetti herself, the firm has developed soberly in recent years. “An option which is no longer a requirement today, she says, insofar as we have consolidated our bases and as our products are unanimously acknowledged by a large number of European customers, particularly in Germany and Northern Europe, but also by American customers.  France remains a young market, the last to have been approached, but where there is an undeniable interest for our products and a strong development potential”. “Some of our products have also won several awards in Europe over the last 4 years, which encourages us to constantly develop new ideas and formulas.  Passion for our work leads us more than ever to constantly develop our business, relying on our know-how and keeping our standards of creativity, versatility and responsiveness which are for us the appropriate answer to meet market needs and therefore a foundation for a strong partnership with our customers,” she adds. On the occasion of the Cosmoprof tradeshow in Bologna, Italy, the company which distinguished itself, by being the first to launch on the market mascaras with scientifically acknowledged eyelashe lengthening properties, will present a brand new collection, Antidote, ""a genuine beauty prescription, with the help of which to look beautiful also means to feel fine""."
Estée Lauder launches Origins in China to fuel growth,"US cosmetics giant, Estée Lauder, has selected the Parkson Department Store in Shanghai to launch the Origins brand in the People’s Republic of China.  The cosmetics maker expects to open four more doors in Shanghai and Beijing by June 30, 2010. Origins is a plant-based line of skin care, makeup and aromatherapy products, which was introduced by The Estée Lauder Companies in 1990 as a high-performance natural skin care, powered by nature and proven by science.  Origins’ products are formulated with plants, natural and organic ingredients and 100 percent natural essential oils. According to the company, the Origins’ natural background should match with current expectations of Chinese consumers. “Chinese consumers are passionate about skin care and natural ingredients, so Origins will be very relevant to this market,” Carol Shen, General Manager of The Estée Lauder Companies in China, said. “In fact, the main ingredient in one of Origins most popular anti-aging collections, called ’A Perfect World,’ is White Tea, an extremely potent antioxidant which comes from the mountains of the Fujian Province in southeast China.”  “China is strategically important for our company and we expect that Origins will help fuel our continued expansion here,” commented William P. Lauder, Executive Chairman of The Estée Lauder Companies, who was one of the founders of the Origins’ brand. Estée Lauder first entered China in 1993 and in 2005, the group opened a research and development centre in Shanghai.  China is one of Estée Lauder’s fastest growing markets. In fiscal year 2009, the company’s sales in China grew nearly 30 percent. It is believed that in the next decade, China’s beauty market could rival the size of the market in the United States. Other Estée Lauder Companies’ brands sold in China are Estée Lauder, Clinique, La Mer, MAC, Bobbi Brown, Aramis and the licensed brands Tommy Hilfiger and Donna Karan. The products are sold in upscale department stores and perfumeries in 33 major Chinese cities. The company has also launched e-commerce sites in China for Clinique, Estée Lauder and La Mer. On the occasion of its debuts in China, Origins has partnered with ""Million Forest,"" a reforestation project organized by The Climate Group, United Nations Environment Programme and China Green Foundation, to help preserve the trees and habitats of the Gansu Province. Origins will plant a tree for every product purchased in China through June 30, 2010, from its ""A Perfect World"" and ""Make a Difference"" collections. The launch of Origins in China was also commemorated by a symbolic tree planting near the Origins counter inside the Parkson Department Store in Shanghai."
Bormioli Luigi: the end of the tunnel,"Premium Beauty News - At last! The crisis is behind us! Felice Nardiello - Not so sure! Anyway, we couldn’t fall any lower! As for 2009, Luigi Bormioli ends up the year with sales down 20% compared to the previous year. Which is a lesser evil compared to other sectors which have experienced worse situations. You know that we rely on three areas: glass bottles, tableware and more recently, carafes for spirits. In fact, it’s just as if we had gone back to the 2006 turnover. Imagine the shock! Premium Beauty News - What about the beginning of 2010? Felice Nardiello - Better, of course! Much better! But we must remain cautious. The proper indicator being however the number of new tools currently being produced. In good years we produce approximately 150 yearly. Last year, we only produced 80. Since the beginning of this year, we have 110 under way. At the height of the crisis, we had stopped two ovens. One was restarted in September. For the other one, if the recovery trend is confirmed, it should be operational again by the end of this year. We expect an increase in our turnover of 15% to 20% in 2010. Premium Beauty News - What made it possible for you to resist? Felice Nardiello - Several things. On the one hand our flexibility and our ability to respond quickly to market demands. On the other hand, our brand new plant in Milan the production tool of which turned out to be very well adapted to the constraints of crisis in terms of cost prices. The fact also that in 2009 we started to diversify successfully in the new segment of carafes for spirits where we aim to achieve a turnover of nearly 5 million Euros in the next three years. Premium Beauty News - And innovation in this context? Felice Nardiello - It’s striding along! All directions are taken advantage of. And we will surely be able to market products you don’t even expect, to improve glass resistance, while adding new barriers and aesthetic properties to it."
Coster: “historical recovery”,"Premium Beauty News - The sharp drop of the market at the end of 2008 and early 2009 was followed by a timid recovery in September 2009 to end up with a historical recovery since November. What’s your feedback? Claudio Contini - It is true that we went through an extraordinary period, from all points of view and in the literal sense. Personally, I had never seen that before. Imagine that for the aerosol filling machines we didn’t book any orders during the last 3 months of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009. Consider that during the same period orders on pumps, valves and spray caps had fallen by some 20%. It is only as of May 2009 that a hesitant recovery occurred. It increased significantly in June and then September. Eventually, and thanks to the strong rebound in October, November and December 2009, we ended the year with a reduced decrease of our turnover. What was unusual during that period was the huge drop of what I call “consumables” and the very long period during which we booked no machine orders. We had truly never experienced such a situation before. Premium Beauty News - With disparities depending on the countries where you were operating? Claudio Contini - The situation was better not necessarily in the countries you are thinking about. In our case, we performed well in the United States, South America and … France. A country where we even increased our market share, thanks mainly to the L’Oréal Group and the Fareva Group with whom we strengthened our positions. On the other hand, Germany, Holland, Spain and the UK suffered a lot, like Greece, North Africa and of course Russia, where no one was buying anything in the first half of 2009. Premium Beauty News - What about the Asian area? Claudio Contini - As you may remember, we have invested in a factory in India in 2008, with the aim to bring local production to a level comparable to an European one, with the same standards of quality and service, but still profiting from the ""best-cost country"" advantage offered locally. The domestic market was healthy, but the factory was also supplying Middle East and Russia and therefore it suffered from the crisis. Concerning our factory in Malaysia, may I remind you that it is mainly positioned on the spray-caps manufacturing for the insecticide market. Premium Beauty News - What is your outlook on the coming months? Claudio Contini - Very difficult to say. We still need to be very cautious. The de-stocking phase is temporarily over and we are now obviously benefiting from a really strong recovery, but it’s hard to say what will happen next. Premium Beauty News - During these last months your investments were mainly focused on the pharmaceutical sector! Claudio Contini - That’s right! The pharmaceutical production structures in Italy are focusing much of our efforts with, in particular, the putting into service, last October, of a state-of-the-art clean room. Of course we are still remaining very active in the beauty sector, mainly in the mass market. Premium Beauty News - Spray-Cap manufacturing has really become one of your key specialties! Claudio Contini - A recognized specialty: Coster is maintaining its global leadership in this area! Among our latest developments we are quite proud of the new special actuators for Garnier and Gillette deodorants."
Biokolor Make-Up wants to transpose to skincare its success in make-up,"Mario De Luigi, one of the founders, comments for Premium Beauty News the latest news about this company that appealed to cosmetics brands like with make-up formulas incorporating a high level of skincare, smooth powders, mascaras with intense brightness and colours, lipsticks where comfort is as important as matteness and colour variety, comfortable and smooth glosses… All of this with a total self-funding of investments, both in research and development and in terms of industrial tools. Premium Beauty News - Ten years already? Mario De Luigi - Yes already! Time just flies! It is hard to imagine that at the time, we started business, about ten kilometres from here in a tiny workshop with a team of four people, making foundations and emulsions.  It’s at the same time a very short and very long period.  But the result is there.  Thanks to our efforts, Biokolor Make-Up has earned a reputation in the field of creation and production of formulations for the cosmetic industry.  Not many secrets to achieve this but a lot of work, creativity, concern for quality, (whatever the quantities), novelty in formulas and flexibility regarding market demands. Premium Beauty News - In spite of the crisis? Mario De Luigi - Well, I might surprise you, but so to speak we didn’t feel its effects. This is probably a sign of our good health. Our sales remained unchanged in 2009 compared to 2008, and 2010 has begun very well. Premium Beauty News - In 2010 you will participate in two major events: Cosmoprof Bologna and MakeUp in Paris. What will be the highlights? Mario De Luigi - The main highlights will be new types of emulsions, new types of powders with new textures. What characterizes probably best Biokolor Make-Up is the high level of research involved in product development.  The mascara activity also benefits a lot from this, which allows us to offer ranges appealing to our customers because of their intensity in colours, brightness and natural look.  We also always have had the will to introduce in our recipes formulas incorporating a high level of skincare. Regarding Cosmoprof Bologna, we will showcase a lot of novelties in emulsion, but also very nice surprises concerning powders and skincare under the functional but also visual aspects. As for MakeUp in Paris, it’s a brand new concept of Business to Business event where we will really be in a position to “stage” our know-how.  It’s really innovative and we are currently figuring out the best way to stage our products. Premium Beauty News - Environment, eco-certification, development of natural products are part of your research and developments universe. Mario De Luigi - That’s right!  We have always believed in that!  For over five years, we have been working on organic products, especially on fully plant-based products and we currently have a wide range of certified products. Undoubtedly one of the largest existing on the market.  There is a team working daily on these topics at Treviglio. In this area, we will present specific lines where new technologies have been applied to improve sensoriality making these natural products even more comparable with performances of high end perfumery products. Premium Beauty News - Skincare is also a developing area at Biokolor Make-Up! Mario De Luigi - We have just put the finishing touches to a series of products called ""no surgery"".  Very effective products for wrinkles and for a fresh facial skin tone. And of course, we are also developing organic and eco certified products.  Today at Biokolor Make-Up, skincare and make-up are addressed the same way."
Faber-Castell Cosmetics: « under the sign of competitiveness and innovation »,"Premium Beauty News - After a harsh year 2009, what about the economic situation in 2010? Stefano Castelletti - For the time being we have every reason of being satisfied with the current pace. Demand is sustained. As for the year 2009, we have nothing to complain about. We will have reached roughly the same figures as those recorded in 2008. Certainly, throughout the past year, we had to adapt to a particularly tense market in terms of volumes and prices. Specially on prices incidentally! We have continually improved, over this period, the performances of our production equipment to make them more flexible and more competitive. At the same time, we have continued to invest in innovation which remains one of our main keys to keep on progressing in our market. Some of the highlights of this innovative approach, the launch of pencils complying perfectly with new environmental requirements (Ecocert certified). Premium Beauty News - The origin, not to say the very soul of Faber Castell, still remains the wooden pencil! What about this product? Stefano Castelletti - The wooden pencil still accounts for more than 50% of our business. Obviously, you haven’t heard the last of wooden pencil. We will prove it this year by marketing a variety of new pencils innovating in textures implemented (new formulas) but also decoration. Within the next 5 years we will also see the appearance of superior formulae suited for plastic cased products as well as liquid products which will of course challenge the share of wooden pencils. Premium Beauty News - All these novelties will be the strong points of your presence this year at both, Cosmoprof Bologna and MakeUp in Paris? Stefano Castelletti - At the moment nobody exactly knows how consumer behavior will shift or change in times after the recession. Certainly individuality is on the rise which means an exciting time with a lot of creativity and profiling also in design. Under the slogan ""Express Yourself"" we are going to present our latest innovations in packaging and fomula, three different concepts that add glamour and uniqueness to cosmetic pencils: – C’EST CHIC: Sophisticated products with funky surface design – visible and touchable. 
– HOT STUFF: Vivid make-up colours and formulae with ultimate staying power. 
– HIGH ENERGY: A careful selection of ingredients and their high concentration spell magic to make-up. Premium Beauty News - Your industrial presence is concentrated in Europe with the German factory and South America with a plant in Brazil. What about Asia? Stefano Castelletti - We successfully produce stationary products in China and we have established factories in Indonesia and Malaysia. In our opinion the Asian cosmetics market is in process of an important evolution that we are observing. The Latin American market has stepped beyond evolution and have experienced strong growth recently. Premium Beauty News - There is much talk about full-service, but in fact it’s a daily practice for you! Stefano Castelletti - There are a lot of different interpretations of full service due to the open supply chain for cosmetic products. At Faber-Castell we traditionally manage vertical integration in manufacturing. It’s our business, our vocation."
Pibiplast: offensive strategy on make-up,"Premium Beauty News - Eventually, the takeover in 2002 of the Bomal company, which was specialized in the make-up segment and located in Robbiate, turned out to be a good idea? Giorgio Bosi - Figures speak for themselves. At the time, the company was employing 21 people, it has more than doubled the figure since it has now a staff of 45. The plant in Robbiate can currently rely on 25 injection machines, 10 blow molding extrusion machines and 4 air-blown injection machines. Not to mention all the equipment used for finishings. The facility can produce a full range of packaging for make-up, that is to say, not only twenty million mascaras per year, but also lip-gloss, eye-liners, lipstick tubes. And the turnover generated by this activity currently weighs 10 million Euros (it was half less when we acquired the company) compared with the 24 million made by the entire Pibiplast Group. Stefania Bosi - I must add that we obviously have no intention to leave it at that. Clearly our aim is to double the turnover within the five years to come. We are currently giving ourselves the means to achieve this goal. Under my direct responsibility, we have strengthened our marketing and sales presence in this area and we are about to obtain some quite interesting commercial results around the world, particularly on the European market. Premium Beauty News - Which doesn’t mean you have been neglecting the other division body care / skin care! Giorgio Bosi - Of course not! The Correggio facility remains a model of its kind that we are constantly bringing up to date each year. It currently incorporates 40 blow-moulding extrusion machines, 10 blow drawing injection machines and 25 injection machines. The 3,000 sqm workshop dedicated to finishing includes no less than 11 serigraphy printing machines including 5 with up to six colors, plus 2 five-color offset machines, 2 pad printing machines (up to 6 colors), equipment for infra-red varnishing and one machine to insert retractable sleeves. Over the next three years, the Correggio facility will expand by 60% and the program for the next coming years plans to build 5,000 sqm more in addition to the already available 9,000 sqm. Our advantage in this Body Care / Skin Care segment remains in the fact it’s backed-up by this production capacity, but that it can also relies on its versatility and its adaptability. Premium Beauty News - These extra 5,000 sqm should allow you to merge your entire group on the same site? Giorgio Bosi - Not exactly! We believe in the specialization of our sites, and Correggio must remain focused on the production of Body Care / Skin Care and Robbiate on make-up! We would rather concentrate our logistics operations for ""products"", which are currently 15km. away, near the Reggio Emilia highway, for obvious efficiency reasons and to improve our industrial logistics. Premium Beauty News - Italy remains Pibiplast’s largest market? Giorgio Bosi - Yes, it’s true, the Italian market accounts for 45% of our business, but our country is closely followed by France and the rest of the EU."
Mascara Plus: to handle growth,"A real saga the Italian way, the story of this company created by David Chant, a former executive from L’Oreal who specialized in formulating and manufacturing mascara. A true talent, which incidentally obliged him to wait patiently for a year, the necessary time for him to be released from the restraint of trade clause, before he could set off alone on a big adventure in 2002 with the help of a small network of subcontractors. After two years spent alone in Turin, our man starts to structure his business internally and settles in the actual existing plant on the outskirts of Milan in 2005. A pivotal year where the firm displays a turnover of EUR 400,000. Four years later, the figure exceeds EUR 3 million and the production capacity of 25 tons / month is no longer sufficient. “And we have specialized solely on mascara and we are staying on it!  No question of getting involved in other products. We are already finding it difficult to supplying. Why diversify?”, insists David Chant. The reasons for success? “Precisely this specialty, says Alistair Beavan, Director of Operations, and of course the quality of our products. Incidentally, one is the result of the other”. And then there are a few tricks like the double brush mascara developed by the Italian firm with a special machine installed in Asia but belonging to the company.  The brush can lengthen, define and give volume to eyelashes at once. “There is above all the acknowledged qualities of our formulations,” underlines David Chant, “which allow us to position ourselves at all levels of the market.” To meet strong market demand, the firm has equipped itself, last October, with a filling and labeling line capable of processing 30 000 pieces / day. Investment cost: EUR 200,000. “And we have no intention of stopping our efforts, says David Chant, since we have plans to purely and simply double the production workshop by the end of 2010”."
AptarGroup begins strategic realignment,"US-headquartered AptarGroup, a leader in the dispensing system industry, is undertaking a strategic realignment of its businesses under three market-focused business segments, namely: beauty and home products, food and beverage, and phamaceuticals. The AptarGroup will be consequently reorganised in three business units: Aptar Beauty + Home, Aptar Food + Beverage and Aptar Pharma.  “By realigning our businesses in a way that is completely market focused, we will make it even easier for customers to do business with us,” explained Peter Pfeiffer, President and CEO. The AptarGroup said this realignment should be fully operational in 2011. As part of the strategic realignment new visual identities were developed for Aptar’s three segments and for the corporate enterprise. Pfeiffer added that each segment identifier has a unique colour.  The new identity is centred on the group’s name and the names of its subsidiaries such as Valois or Pfeiffer should be replaced by Aptar Beauty & Home and Aptar Pharma. Analysts welcomed Aptar’s realignment considering it would help the company to focus on its end-markets."
Sourcing: Cosfibel to reinforce its global network,"To reinforce its expertise and accelerate its developments in boxes (cardboard, leather, MDF, metal ...) and luggage, Cosfibel has incorporated the teams and the suppliers network of a Chinese company. This way, the Group strengthens its human skills and owns locally, two strategic industrial tools: two sample rooms (sampling workshops), one dedicated to boxes in Shenzhen and the other one to luggage in Dungun. Main advantage according to Cosfibel: monitoring the sampling process which influences at the same time, control of industrial development and of costs. “The key factor for success in promotional items is,with the price, appropriate sampling in record time, a proof that manufacturing is controlled, with the expected price and quality. When we are capable of developing the samples, this means that all stages in the development process are validated,” explains Stanislas Peronnet, Director of Operations for Cosfibel group. According to the group, design and validation of the industrialization of its products guarantee the development of complex studies with very high quality requirements. Cosfibel in Southern China, it’s a total staff of 25 employees in charge of development and quality control. Even if China, the historical partner of the group, remains its largest supplier, Cosfibel is continually identifying new sources, in particular for both proximity reasons, both for the sake of flexibility, sustainability and to reduce products’ carbon footprint. In North African countries, Cosfibel has already established partnerships for boxes and cases in Morocco and Algeria. The group has passed a new milestone by signing a partnership with two plants (metal parts) in Tunisia.  In Europe, the group has developed textile business with Turkey and is exploring new avenues in Romania. Another example, Cosfibel UK, the English subsidiary has undertaken locally the production of boxes on behalf of a client, Beverage, and thus has provided the fastest and most appropriate solution to meet the customer’s request. As for Cosfibel US, the subsidiary works with cardboard makers in Mexico."
MBF: “Flawless quality has become our Bible”,"""Two years to be remembered"" is how one can qualify 2008 and 2009 at MBF Plastiques [1]. Since, the firm based in Oyonnax, in the South of France, has designed one after the other  One Million by Paco Rabanne, Ricci by Nina Ricci, Scarlett by Cacharel and L’Eau Mega by Viktor Horsting & Rolf Snoeren. Launches that somewhat toke one’s breath away by their innovation in marketing or technical feat or both at the same time. But in all cases, products which clearly attracted consumers. Premium Beauty News - One has the feeling that MBF has made a real come back in the luxury segment? True or false? Jean-Michel Fouilland – Yes and No! We have always been in high-end packaging for perfumery and cosmetics. We have never ceased to be. May I remind you that MBF signed in the early 1980s, Yves Saint Laurent’s first Opium, who was in its own way a true revolution for the sector. And along the same line we designed, Magie Noire (Lancôme), Kouros (YSL), Maxim’s, Choc, Énigme, Rose Cardin (P. Cardin), le féminin Eternity (Calvin Klein), NOA (Cacharel). Then it is true that as of the early 1990s, the company was wearing two hats ""luxury packaging"" and ""technical parts"" with, in particular the creation of an industrial site dedicated mainly to the production of service caps. It’s probably from that time that our image became somewhat blurred. Premium Beauty News - Until the early 2000s when a repositioning occured! Jean-Michel Fouilland - That’s right! We decided to make a stronger come back in the segment of perfumery and cosmetics packaging. A dedicated Sales team was set up. Without a break, the manufacturing unit of industrial parts is converted into a production hall dedicated to the manufacture of mascaras (air-blown injection, assembly and decoration). In a few months, the effects are felt immediately. In 2000, it’s MBF who designs the new Givenchy for men. Then in 2002, Omnia by Bvlgari, followed in 2004 byAqua, also from Bvlgari. A period also corresponding to what will become a real know-how for MBF, in other words mastering the design of sophisticated spray-caps. It’s also at the same period that we created image overmouldings on a make-up remover for Lancôme in 2005. And then follows men’s Armani Diamond in 2006 and then women’s Ultra Violet by Paco Rabanne. A creation which highlighted all our know-how in the making of a very cost effective spray-cap: from three manufacturing molds thought of at first, our engineers managed to only design one! Premium Beauty News - This is probably one of your main assets: finding what will make the difference! Jean-Michel Fouilland - Well, that’s what made the difference so far. Surely a state of mind. From a brief, strive to find what will help design the part at the lowest cost and best quality level possible. We are dealing with process innovation. Automation, robotics, Choices in terms of multi-injection, all necessary industrial choices to be considered. ""Flawless quality"" has become our Bible. And believe me, it’s not always that simple. Look at the Viktor & Rolf and its pear composed of nearly 12 pieces assembled automatically. A real puzzle of injected technical parts in order to dispense the product by applying pressure on both sides of the brand logo itself. Even the bi-material ""Ricci"" cap, made from PP densified and PP Homo was not that simple with its collar in two parts including a ""ribbon"" with an invisible bond line and its finishing achieved with vacuum metallization and shiny varnish. Premium Beauty News - Mastering the design of spray-caps has become a real specialty! Jean-Michel Fouilland - We had this opportunity in the early 2000s and over the years our knowledge has considerably improved. To such a point that we have ended up designing some nozzles for actuators because of cost control issues and technological know-how. One thing leading to another, we were asked to design dispensing systems for even more accomplished products. The Viktor & Rolf probably being one of the most sophisticated one we had to design. And this is probably not finished. Premium Beauty News – And what about crisis? Jean-Michel Fouilland – We took the blow like everyone else, but maybe not as severely. Our industrial choices proved to be the right ones and the fact we refocused on our high-end real technical know-how is paying off today. We certainly finished last year down on 2008 but almost at the same level as 2007."
"I.L. Cosmetics, from nail polish to make-up","Premium Beauty News - Éric Wimmer, you have been heading for the past few months IL Cosmetics, a company specialized in the production and filling of nail polishes, mascara, eyeliners and lipgloss. Industrial investments currently under way at the Luxembourg historic site are substantial! How are they going to impact the layout and organization of the site? Éric Wimmer - Indeed, investments under way are substantial! In a previous article published in your newsletter, we had announced 11 million Euros in five years, including six million by 2011. As for the industrial site, may I remind you that it is divided into three distinct facilities: two autonomous buildings, the first one for the production of nail polishes, the second one for the production of make-up and a packaging facility, dedicated to all our products.  The total filling capacity for nail polishes ranges from 30 to 35 million units per year. For the other make-up products it was about 20 million units in 2009, with a 30% growth scheduled in 2010. This obviously has an incidence on the site’s organization. Some ofthe investment planned by 2011 is dedicated to the construction of a specialized building for the production of all our make-up products (Luxcos). This will allow us to increase our filling capacity for nail polishes in the existing and consequently exclusively dedicated building (Interpack). This specialization will help us reach our goal which is to double our sales within 4 years. Premium Beauty News - Until the decision for diversification occurred in the early 2000s, the history of IL Cosmetics was intimately linked to that of nail polish. Éric Wimmer - Absolutely! As you know, there aren’t that many players in the nail polish segment. Because it’s a very technical and demanding industrial sector. A bit of history is necessary here... Before the 1915/1920 period, women used to apply on their nails different kinds of products, one of them made of a plant, henna, displaying a brown / orange color. For years, they settled for polishing their nails to make them shiny. Hence the still currently used expression in English, of nail polish. The end of Second World War brings the use of varnish as we know it today. A Charles Revson (who later on founded ""Revlon"") teams up with a painting company, Mass. & Wallenstein and markets the first dye and nitrocellulose-based nail polish. The making of premium nail polish is much more complex than you might imagine. Because the enamel must actually meet a number of criteria: correct application, brightness, drying time ... At the time, quite a challenge for the engineers. the dye must be ""fixed"", the colored pigments must remain in suspension. Nowadays, as you know, you can even add PET sheets based glitters and the choice in colors can extend infinitely. Premium Beauty News - Advances in terms of drying times reveal a lot about progress achieved in this industry! Éric Wimmer - It is a very good example! Lifestyles have changed, women today are active. They can no longer afford to spend too much time for the application of their polish which must then dry in 1 to 3 minutes. Durability on the nail is also an important criterion which may reach 5 days. Premium Beauty News - I.L. Cosmetics is one of the few, if not the only manufacturer of nail polishes, to have diversified itself in make-up. Éric Wimmer - That’s true. We master techniques inherent in the development of a complex product such as nail polish: mixtures, dispersions, colors. So we can put this technical expertise to good use for other products such as lipgloss the complexity of which stands in color setting and mastering its application and mascara, with in addition mastering emulsions."
"Thomas Jonas, MWV: ""All set for 2010""","Premium Beauty News - Against all expectations, it appears finally that 2009 was a decent year for your Group! Thomas Jonas - Quite true! And that applies to all areas under my responsibility, namely pumps, trigger sprayers and cardboard processing. The second part of the year was good with a very strong last quarter. Needless to say that we also benefited from very strong demand for dispensing systems of antiseptic products against influenza. Even though the potential for spread is currently very low, we really have the feeling that a new consumption pattern has been set and that consumers have started using these products routinely, particularly in the United States. This is an extremely competitive and capitalistic segment in which we have been investing for many years, and we now have a strong position. In addition, perfume pumps and even more so, cosmetics pumps finally performed well throughout the year 2009. I would also like to add that, in this perfumery segment, the end of 2009 also marks a milestone as our group in the United States was legally considered as the inventors of the transparent dip tube. To note also the marketing of our new mini-trigger sprayers. Premium Beauty News - Airless seems more than ever to be on a roll! Don’t you think? Thomas Jonas - Obviously! This technology is fully adapted to new consumer demand and to the development of greener and more protective cosmetic products. As I already had the opportunity to tell you here, a few months ago, we are still increasing our research effort in this field and we are, commercially speaking, doing very well with our system working perfectly. You know that concerning this area, we have decided to dispatch our production tool in key areas of the world where we are already operating industrially, i.e. North America, Spain and China. We will continue to innovate in airless in 2010. Premium Beauty News - You just mentioned your industrial presence at the four corners of the globe. China is obviously at the heart of this strategy! Thomas Jonas - Yes, of course! And contrary to received ideas, we have out there, in Wuxi near Shanghai what is probably the most modern production unit in the world. The site, incidentally, looks more like a genuine ""industrial campus ""than a plant, strictly speaking. We are centralizing over there all our know-how in the field of pumps, trigger sprayers, airless and cardboard processing. Above all, everything is ultra-automated! A presence on this continent that we anticipated to cope with what is known to be a permanently booming market."
"Plastic industry and cosmetics, ""the essential solidarity""","Several speeches were held alternately between the two professions during the one day event organized by the Centre de Formation de la Plasturgie (Training Center of the Plastic industry) et du Centre Européen de Dermocosmétologie (European Center of Dermocosmetology). Among the addressed topics: cosmetics and their formulation, plastics and packaging, interaction between content and container, the value of packaging and innovations, design and new features offered by packaging. A roundtable was also organized between several players in sustainable development concerning issues on eco-design, biodegradability, recycling and regulations. Icing on the cake, demonstration workshops and products from the cosmetology and plastic industry were also displayed to attendees. According to Gérard Goujon, CEO of PRP Création and President of Allizé-Plasturgie Rhône-Alpes, ""This one day event is definitely a starting point for greater cooperation between these two trades and it should enable them not only to change the plain supplier/customer relationship, but also suggest together new means to explore and share experiences. The first question to ask is truly, what can we achieve together? We must exchange, find, suggest, think. We must also be united to defend ourselves together, suggest together, create together, be involved with a real right to vote on our future."" According to Dominique Bouvier, CEO of Strand Cosmetics Europe and President of the European Center of Dermocosmetology, the purpose of such a dialogue is also to find answers: ""facing regulations, groundless concerns on the safety of our products, the trend on organic and sustainable development, the power of brand owners, media campaigns harmful to the industry, changing attitudes, consumer habits, globalization, players in the plastic and cosmetic industry have no other choice than talk, exchange, share!"" ""The end customer is the same: the consumer. The decision makers are the same: brand owners, who expect from us industrial cleverness, practical ingenuity, solutions, innovation. Let’s remove barriers and start inter-trade cooperation based on mutual respect, sharing of values, information, equity of contributions, transparency,"" she adds."
Louvrette carries on with its industrial revolution,"Premium Beauty News - Founded in1964 by Gerd and Dieter Erlhöfer, Louvrette soon became one of three leaders in the European market of make-up cases. In 1994, it is the shift for the production of jars, particularly with the first thick wall jars, and today with new lines incorporating smooth bottles, airless bottles including their closures. Fabian Erhölfer - Like any company specialized in plastic injection, we obviously had to adapt to the globalization of markets in the cosmetic sector. And the shift operated at the time, in the mid 90s by the management team was necessary. Make-up cases which was the core business of the company, was no longer viable confronted to Asian countries. It was absolutely necessary to find something else. Currently, the production of jars accounts for nearly 80% of Louvrette’s business and that of make-up cases for more than 20%. Obviously the changes operated in the mid 90s were salutary for three reasons. Firstly, because we have acquired a unique expertise in the design of jars of all shapes (cylindrical, conical, rounded, etc..), In particular multi-print, then because it allowed us to widen our offer with the production of a combined range of bottles, airless bottles and closures (bottles in 150, 200 and 250 ml, airless in 15, 30 et 50ml), finally, because all the investments made, particularly during the construction of the new plant in 2007, allow us to consider with confidence future developments also including the segment of make-up cases that we have not abandoned as a part of the production is very likely to be transferred back to Europe. Premium Beauty News - In which case, this would be in a way, a return to one’s root? Fabian Erhölfer - In a way, yes. But if you compare the technical and industrial background, Louvrette presently has little to do with what the company looked like in the 1980s. We have significantly increased our technical level and optimized our production. The new plant, built in 2007 with an investment exceeding 1.8 million Euros, is a perfect example environmentally speaking. We use a very small percentage of chemicals in our production. For waste treatment, we rely on companies specialized in recycling. No harmful emissions are released into the atmosphere during production of plastic parts, thanks to a sophisticated air filtration system. Of course, we have installed a wastewater filtering system. Manufacturing generates no heat nor noise or smell. Of course, we reuse, whenever possible, cores which are directly transformed into pellets to be reused into machines. For the cooling of machines and tools, we have invested in a hot and cold air recycling system, which allows us to achieve energy savings of 80% and reduce CO2 emissions. Our investment plan for machines includes replacement of obsolete equipment with high energy consumption by latest generation machines with reduced energy consumptions. We have just invested in an electric injection molding machine. 2010 will be the year of ISO 14001 certification for Louvrette and we are very seriously considering the possibilities of replacing fossil polymers with plant based polymers among others. In terms of design, we can offer products that will integrate our standards or develop specific packaging. The design of our standard packaging varies depending on customer demand, it is timeless and functional. So each brand is free to customize its packaging with colors, finishings and decorations that we offer them. For that purpose, we strive to take account of trends and prevailing creativity. As part of our new Customer Design, we help our customers from designing to product launch and put all our experience and know how to good use: product designing, quick prototype design, 3D, designing and industrial manufacturing of tools by ourselves. Premium Beauty News - Jars, bottles, closures, cases ... you are both in the universe of care and make-up. An area with increasing innovation. Fabian Erhölfer - Quite true and we will be active in this segment of innovation in 2010. I can already tell you, without giving any details, that we are working with other partners on the design of an airless jar that will be really innovative."
The new ambitions of the European Dermocosmetology Centre,"Premium Beauty News - This last summer, you were appointed as new President of the European Dermocosmetology Centre (Centre européen de dermocosmétologie - CED), which is based in Lyon. You are declaring a strong willingness to boost this organisation. Dominique Bouvier - Action was needed.  I took the decision at that time with the difficulties that you can imagine, I mean that I am already strongly committed to the management of Strand Cosmetics Europe, within the harsh economic context of 2009… At the same time, it was also important to motivate the CED members in order to crack the whip of the organisation’s activities, and thus to promote the assets of the Rhône-Alpes region in the cosmetics business, in particular its industrial capabilities and university laboratories. Indeed, the cosmetic science is closely linked to the health sector, which plays a major role in the economy of the region. What we need is to strengthen the association’s image through a common and visible project. Therefore we have to insist on the strategic vision of our association, in particular with decision makers. Premium Beauty News - What concrete actions are you planning? Dominique Bouvier - We have already entered into an agreement with the SFC [1] in order to organize a one-day preview of the IFSCC [2] in Lyon in 2014.  You may think it is a distant event, but actually it is not.  For us it is an opportunity, with the aim that this day be the highlight of this global event. We must work immediately in order to attract the world’s most renown scientists with an ambitious and relevant programme that will highlight all the competences of the region’s universities. Premium Beauty News - What are your main assets? Dominique Bouvier - There are other associations, like the Cosmetic Valley or Cosmed, that make a very good job… So is there room left for another association? Yes! Of course yes! Our main asset is our cluster of universities, with its researchers and scientists.  There is room left for us as a pole of excellence in the field of research in cosmetic science. We can assert ourselves strongly and differently through the concept of science for the sake of cosmetology.  We need to develop a strong image that will be recognized worldwide.  I believe it is possible, as far as we rely on the quality of our graduate schools and universities. Eventually, the three main axes of our communication are: – Rhône-Alpes or Lyon
– Human skin and health

Premium Beauty News - Can you talk about yourself? Dominique Bouvier - My professional background is simple.  I am a pharmacist, I graduated from the University Lyon I in 1974, with a speciality in biology.  I had a first professional experience in a hospital then in a medical laboratory. In 1980, trained in industrial pharmacology, with a speciality in cosmetology, at the IPIL [4] with professor Marie Claude Martini and professor Jean Cotte, and I acquired the company Strand Cosmetics Europe in 1981.  I have been heading Strand’s directory in June 2008. Only projects and the pleasure to achieve them together with a devoted team motivate me.  My values are those I developed in the practice of collective sport."

"Philippe Benacin, Inter Parfums: ""2010, the post-crisis year""","Premium Beauty News - A few words about Inter Parfums and the economic environment of the latest months.  What is the outlook on 2010? Philippe Benacin - Against all expectations, the year 2009 wasn’t that bad eventually. Remember that in 2008 our turnover exceeded 264 million Euros and that, in 2009, it will be on a trend of just over 252 million Euros. The drop is relatively limited, especially as our business in 2008 had profited from very positive opportunities in terms of launches. In addition, last year finally ended up on a very good trend. In terms of strategy, the group is significantly strengthening its prospects with: – creation of a new development strategy with the preparation of a complete line of make-up under the Burberry brand name. This line, the launch of which is planned during next summer, will facilitate a better visibility of perfumes at a retail level;
– diversification of the portfolio materialized next fall by the signature of a license agreement with the luxury brand Jimmy Choo. As for this year, it promises to be full of new quality initiatives and should help our sales exceed 265 million Euros, an increase of over 9% in constant currency values compared to 2009, with in particular: – a line of fragrances for women and men, Burberry Sport in February;
– a line of fragrances for women, Oriens by Van Cleef & Arpels in March;
– a Burberry make-up line in June;
– lines of women’s fragrances under the brand names Lanvin and ST Dupont in July;
– a line of men’s fragrances under the brand name Van Cleef & Arpels in September. Premium Beauty News - The crisis has not yet finished causing damage upstream of the sector, taking into account, among other factors, de-stocking policies which never seem to end. Philippe Benacin - Well, good news concerning de-stocking policies, they are over! Our stock levels are extremely low and the year 2010 will be totally different. We will be ordering again! Premium Beauty News - What about this license agreement with Montblanc? Philippe Benacin - With leading positions in writing instruments, watches and leather goods, a promising development in women’s jewelry, an active presence in more than 70 countries, a network of 350 owned stores and high requirements on quality design and products, Montblanc has a potential for growth in fragrances and derived products. This partnership with a hundred-year old luxury brand acknowledged worldwide, reinforces the development prospects of our group in the segment of selective perfumery. Premium Beauty News - This is undoubtedly one of the peculiarities of your group, total subcontracting, industrially speaking. What do you think is the balance to find between subcontracting in Europe, and more particularly in France, and Asia? Philippe Benacin - Quite true! And by the way, the induced jobs represent, in my opinion, at least 600 people. As for the breakdown, it is clear that the filling is a 100% achieved in France, the purchase of components is done mostly in Europe (70% to 75%), not much in the United States and finally, very little in Asia (except for zamac). This is largely due to the fact that our business is essentially focused on the perfume segment. A configuration which changes of course a little with Burberry’s new activity in make-up, especially concerning packaging where Asia has clearly taken a strong position. But remember that Italy remains a major player in the area of cosmetic ingredients. Premium Beauty News - Will your arrival in the make-up segment also extend to other brands you own? Philippe Benacin - In principle, no! This is justified with Burberry considering what the turnover of this brand accounts for within Inter Parfums (EUR 160 million). Remember that our second brand has a turnover of 40 million Euros. But I would like to underline that, on a marketing point of view, make-up is definitely a powerhouse for a brand. A drive that must not be neglected."
Qualipac: the three axes strategy!,"Premium Beauty News - What were the main reasons that drove you to have the Qualipac group move in these three directions? Pierre Hémar - Simply enough, industrial logic confronted to the logic of changing customer markets. It was obvious  that to remain among the front runners of preferred suppliers to global key players in the beauty industry, we had to be also operating on the main continents where they were going to grow. It was also necessary to offer them everything they required in terms of ""full service"", which we were fortunately able to offer in addition to our industrial know-how in plastics processing, with our expertise in all areas of packaging, accessories, thanks also to our privileged ties with world’s top glassmaker: Pochet. Premium Beauty News - A few strings were missing to your bow, right? Pierre Hémar - Quite true! Industrially speaking, we were not involved in the manufacture of high-end parts made of zamac even though we had been already relying on Asian subcontractors for twenty years. That is why we decided to build, from scratch, this new plant in China to process this material. We were not operating in South America, particularly Brazil, which remains and will remain one of the most dynamic markets in the Beauty universe. We took over Ipel, with a factory which also allows us to develop a real expertise both in the make-up area and for a ""high-end"" lipstick mechanism. Not to mention that the Brazilian plant will also inherit from all of Qualipac’s know-how in terms of finishing and assembling techniques, thus developing its offer. May I also add that our presence in China both in plastic and zamac processing could also lead in the coming months to aluminum processing. Premium Beauty News - A technical and geographical reorganization that didn’t stop you from accelerating the upgrading of your French factories? Pierre Hémar - We don’t have the choice! No one in the European industry has the choice! Durability of production tools in Europe could only be and can only be achieved through automation and innovation. That’s what we have been working on and will continue to work on. Latest example to date, the complete automation at Auriplast, thanks to robots, of the assembling on the frames of parts meant to be galvanized. And we will proceed the same way with the disassembling post, once the parts are treated. A ""small"" operation which will still cost nearly 5 million Euros! Not to mention significant investments achieved for the setting up of specific assembly lines, such as the one which allowed us to design the latest Hugo Boss for which we provide, by the way, a truly comprehensive service including taking delivery of bottles, automatic assembling of the base and repackaging of the whole for shipment, offering a new service to the customer. But there is also innovation. Which is constantly driving us at all levels of responsibility. We are the only ones currently able to offer a ""genuine silver"" galvanizing, the aspect of which will not alter with time. Our engineers have also managed to block metal oxidation using passivation. I can also tell you about our new dispensing jar. 2010 should not disappoint you. Premium Beauty News - Precisely, let’s talk about this year! What are your expectations? Pierre Hémar - Circumspect! But we can only be optimistic after a particularly trying previous year where everything combined to weaken our profession. Declining volumes, falling prices ... everything was on our way. We ended the year at - 15%! At the start of 2010, volumes are back a little bit. On the contrary we are still experiencing price levels totally incompatible with the health of our businesses. This will have to change! Of course, this situation forced us to further improve our productivity (which has been the case!) and the flexibility of our production units, but you cannot ask us to have top technology and invest while our margins are collapsing."
Choosing metal to tell a story,"Premium Beauty News - Massilly was already active in the luxury segment. What are the changes with ""My Box""? A new marketing approach, new targets? Hervé de Rivoire - Massilly has a long history in the metal packaging sector. Our business in its current industrial configuration exists since 1959 (we have just celebrated our fiftieth anniversary!) but the group’s origins and its presence in metal goes back to 1911.The group has a turnover of €220 million and employs 1350 people across the world and through 24 companies. Our activity in boxes and promotional packs has actually always offered solutions to the perfumery-cosmetics sector and we designed a few years ago beautiful cases for Sephora, boxes, for Yves Saint-Laurent Parfums, Biotherm and for a few other brands less recently. In the wine and spirits sector, we designed promotional canisters for Ballantine’s among other brands. We launched the ""My Box by Massilly"" division at the last Luxepack. This new entity provides a dedicated offer with premium cases and boxes for brands. In addition to having industrial resources (see below), it offers a new marketing approach with a new sales team. Our booth at Luxepack reflected this change with the presentation of our new website www.myboxbymassilly.com, a new visual chart and simulation samples dedicated to premium markets. Twenty premium decorations were showcased. Premium Beauty News – Apart from some famous examples, especially with Jean-Paul Gaultier and Calvin Klein, metal appears to have slightly declined in the perfumery and cosmetics packaging sector. During your business meetings, how is this material perceived today by brands? Hervé de Rivoire - Above all, brands try to positively surprise and astonish their customers. The promotional packaging sector for end of the year festivities, Mothers Day, etc..., remains dynamic and most brands traditionally present a gift pack usually containing an eau-de-toilette and a bath product. Metal is still very topical. It remains a very qualitative material when it is finely wrought. It can be beautifully decorated thanks to the offset process using up to 6 colors. We can use mat or shiny lacquers to give a depth of field aspect or play with optical effects. With the embossing process we can increase the visual impact. Metal is an excellent media for brands having a particular story to ""tell""! Premium Beauty News – Did this new strategy call for specific industrial investments? Hervé de Rivoire - In our European factories (in Burgundy and Wales) We have the proper tools to offer a wide range of boxes and cases with cylindrical and square shapes. We are thinking of expanding this range in order to adjust with the current trends in shapes. We are on permanent watch with our printing ink suppliers to offer new decoration finishes. The Massilly group annually invests an average of 7% of its turnover in the industrial tool. Premium Beauty News – Shouldn’t’ the success of My Box by Massilly partly rely on Asia in terms of industrial tools? Hervé de Rivoire - We carried out a market study, end of 2008 - early 2009, on our clients expectations. They want to surprise and innovate. The promotional pack they are looking for must follow the same direction. We can print on boxes of standard shapes and our European entities have a leadership in that domain. If brands want to go beyond the visual impact, Asia has tremendous advantages to offer: we can then work on the most daring shapes, by associating for example, metal with other materials, this was very trendy in 2008 (metal and faux leather, metal and plastic, glued fabric, etc..). Metal can be wrought, cut with an openwork design to unveil the product. This can be achieved within very attractive time limits,. ""My Box"" offers a dual approach: an European offer for standards, an Asian offer for innovative shapes. What also emerged strongly from the study we undertook, is our customers expectation to rely on an ""industrial"" service even if production comes from Asia. Our customers are not just looking for a purchase/resale offer; they want industrial support throughout project development and quality monitoring once the goods are delivered. This is where ""My Box"" stands out by providing our customers with this industrial rigor which has been illustrating the products of the Massilly group for 50 years. We can also offer storage space in our French and European production sites which can also contribute to optimal service. Premium Beauty News - A new year begins. What goals have you set yourselves to improve the marketing of your products in the beauty sector? Hervé de Rivoire - We want to be in a leading position within 5 years. In addition to the contacts already established with some perfum and cosmetics brands, we will, this year, carry on our communication and canvassing actions, in addition to our participation in the following shows, Pack&Gift, Emballage, Luxe Pack and probably in an unusual way, at MakeUp in Paris."
Shiseido bets on overseas markets,"For Shinzo Maeda, Shiseido’s president, there is no alternative to growing abroad, mainly in China and Asian emerging markets.  The company can no longer wait for the waking up of the Japanese market and actually does not believe its home market would ever bring the dynamism that international competition now requires. “Japan is a mature market with a decreasing population,” Mr Maeda explains. Shiseido wants to increase the share of overseas markets in its turnover from 35% today to 50% by 2017, with the aim to become “a global player representing Asia with its origins in Japan.”  During the year 2009, Shiseido has expanded its sales channels in Egypt, Morocco, Laos and Azerbaijan. Shiseido’s strategy for overseas development features three main axes: –  “Innovating the Shiseido global brand” with the aim to integrate the image of the brand as high quality, highly functional and global prestige cosmetics along with strengthening communication capabilities. Additionally, efforts are being directed toward improving the counselling skills of the brands approximately 9,000 Beauty Consultants worldwide, excluding Japan.
– “Development of the City Concept strategy”, whereby the world’s major markets are considered as city-based rather than country-based units, and whereby management resources are concentrated on target cities.
– “Expansion of operations in new and emerging markets.” Measures for innovating the Shiseido global brand include initiatives such as augmenting the product line-up, remodelling the functions and design of counters and strengthening the customer service skills of Beauty Consultants (BCs). The company underlines the importance of BCs’ training in order to expand in-store share in mature markets. According to Shiseido, BCs must communicate brand value and deepen the relationship with customers, “which the brand has cultivated over the years in the Japanese market underpinned by omotenashi (hospitality) activities.” In certain countries, such as Switzerland, the new strategy implied to being able to manage business via direct operations, and company announced last month that it would took over its sales agent in the country, As other for many major players, such as French cosmetics giant L’Oréal, Shiseido considers China and Asian emerging markets as the areas with the main potential for growth in the next years. “Asia, and particularly China, will remain the engine of our growth enabling us to achieve our goal of globalisation by 2017,” says Shinzo Maeda. According to Beijing’s official statistics, the Chinese cosmetics market should grow from 60 million users in 2009 to 200 million by 2015 and 400 by 2020.  With regard to China, Shiseido anticipates a growth of more than 20% of its sales over 2010-2011, a figure to compare approximately 15% upwards expected this year.  The company’s share of the Chinese market would be around 10%, similar to Procter & Gamble and L’Oréal, its main global competitors. The Japanese group intends to capitalize on the good image and the high quality reputation of its products in Asia, where the group enjoys 50 years of experience.  However, its Shiseido brand, which has been sold only in department stores and at specialty retailers in China to date, may remain too expensive for most of the Chinese population.  In order to increase its market share and to tap into the increasing demand, the company has scheduled the launch of a new line of “affordable luxury cosmetics” in March 2010. Under the name DQ, the line will be put up on the shelves of around 600 drugstores in major cities like Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou in the first year.  “Although the channel currently comprises roughly 10% of the market, it is continuously achieving double-digit growth and is expected to grow further in the future,” the company says in release. After their debuts in China, DQ-branded products should be introduced in other Asian countries that the Japanese group considers as a natural extension of its home market. Shiseido, which intends to be present everywhere in Asia, started the activities of its wholly owned Vietnamese subsidiary in December.  Historically, Shiseido commenced sales of its prestige products via a distributor in Vietnam in 1997.  As competition is becoming more intense, Shiseido made the decision to establish a new company in order to further enhance its presence in the market by developing marketing activities. In addition to its high-end Shiseido and Clé de Peau Beauté brands, the Tokyo-based manufacturer intend to expand regular users of its products through developing the Za brand targeting the expanding middle-income group in Asia. Shiseido had carried out the best results of its history in 2007-2008 with an operating profit of 63 billion yens for a turnover of 723 billion. However, its turnover dropped by 4.6% and its operating profit of 21.4%, over 2008-2009. With its Three-Year Plan (FY2008 - FY2010), the company pledged to get back to record results as of 2011-2012."
The ambitions of Piramal Glass,"""Impressive"" is the only word one can think of when enumerating the number of furnaces and production lines of the biggest Indian glassmaker specialized in perfumery and cosmetics. Piramal Glass only owned in 1984, two furnaces dedicated to pharmaceuticals and its turnover at the time was barely reaching a million euros. Yes, you did actually read, one million euros… compared to the billion dollars achieved this year by the group, which is also active in pharmaceuticals, life science research, financial services, real estate and production of glass containers, 40% of which being dedicated to perfumery and cosmetics [1]. Another figure speaks for itself: Piramal claims to be the world’s leading producer of bottles for nail polishes, i.e. one billion bottles per year! Who can top that? Especially when you know the group was not producing a single bottle in 1998. By the way, Piramal Glass’ growth rate this year will be of +15% compared to 2008. A story worthy of a country’s booming economy. ""That’s right, confirms Vijay Shah, Managing Director.  Our progression has been particularly rapid and we are on the right tracks to meet the highest quality standards for perfume and cosmetic bottles"". A quick glance at the industrial tool shows that managers at Piramal group spared no efforts concerning industrial investments since twenty years. First plant, the one of Kosamba, India, which has no fewer than six ovens. A first one of 25 tons / day to produce Type 1 glass with three production lines, which will incidentally, see its capacity rise, within six months, to 40 tons / day with the addition of another line. A second oven of 40 tons / day with four production lines for antibiotic bottles and nail polish bottles. A third oven of 75 tons / day (amber glass) with three production lines which will be dedicated, within one year, to perfumery and cosmetics. Finally, three other furnaces of 35 tons (4 lines), 65 tons (5 lines) with a capacity that will be increased to 100 tons / day in July, and the last and most recent one, of 100 tons / day (five lines) with a dye feeder. This first plant also has an array of workshops dedicated to finishing (screen printing, lacquering, hot stamping, glass etching, installation of retractable sleeve etc.). Second plant, the one in Jambusar, also in India, which has a first furnace of 245 tons / day (6 production lines) dedicated to pharmaceuticals, and a second furnace of 125 tons / day (white glass, 6 lines) for the food industry, perfumery and cosmetics mass market. Then, the plant in Sri Lanka’s where the production capacity of the furnace was simply doubled 18 months ago to step up to 250 tons / day (5 lines), the production of which is mainly for the local market and the production of containers for spirits. Finally the fourth production plant in the U.S. (erstwhile Wheaton Glass) taken over in 2005 and which now has two furnaces of 100 tons / day each with a total of 8 production lines, 60% being dedicated to perfumery and cosmetics. Not to mention two finishing units. Over 120 million euro investments in three years.  This is the total investment of Piramal Glass in three years time, including some 50 million in the United States and 70 million in India and Sri Lanka. ""Today, explains Vijay Shah, perfumery and cosmetics account for 39% of our business. It will represent 55% in three years"". “In the world, the global market for glass in perfumery and cosmetics is estimated to 2 billion dollars, says Vijay Shah, and we believe holding 5% of the market.  Our clients are: Elisabeth Arden, Estée Lauder, L’Oréal, LVMH, Yves Rocher, YSL Beauté, Shiheido, Orlane, Cofinluxe, Coty, PNG... We are subject to very thorough and regular audits at all our plants. Our efforts in cosmetics and perfumery are supplemented with the presence of in-house design studio.” “Our ambitions? They are quite simple: to become one of the top 3 key players in the perfumery and cosmetics industry. We’re on the right path! “"
Cosmeco : specialized in dummies for lipsticks broadens its offer,"57 injection machines, 44 finishing machines a dozen assembly machines ....! Who can that be? A French SME, Cosmeco, created by Michel Poignant and now headed by his son, Alexandre [1]. A SME displaying nonetheless, sizeable industrial strike force and technical skills! Starting point for the firm and still remaining today a main specialty: dummy testers for lipsticks. To do so, the firm has been working for over thirty years with an Austrian injector, Wampl Plastic, whose factory is twenty minutes away from Zurich and who has a flawless reputation in the field of injection of colored parts. "" Dummy testers still represent 60% of our business"", says Alexandre Poignant, Cosmeco’s COO. Second string to the bow of the firm, another industrial partner, a German one this time, the AHA company, which is known for mastering the manufacturing of large capacity pump dispensers. But AHA is also acquiring a solid reputation in the injection of parts partially composed with plant derived material. All this in connection with Bower Ag, a Swiss company that has been developing and marketing for the last few weeks industrial products derived from wet biomass, including plastic granulates, under the brand Agriplast, of PP, PE, PS, ABS type, made with 50% of plant fibers. ""And that’s not all, underlines Alexandre Poignant, since we have become as of last year exclusive representatives in France for products designed by the Korean company Joycos which manufactures airless containers, jars, mascaras, tubes, make-up cases, in particular airtight cases"". "" It is clear that we’re considerably diversifying and broadening Cosmeco’s field of activity, with both the catalog of the Korean company Joycos and the offers from the German and Swiss firms, AHA and Biowert Ag "", insists Michel Poignant. ""You can easily guess that demand for this kind of products half of them made from bio material continues to grow"". The process developed by the Swiss firm is at least very original, simply because it finds its origin in the grass cut by farmers within a radius of five kilometers around the factory. With 5000 tones of forage, annually, it is possible to produce some 500 tones of plastic granulates 50% of which is composed of plant fibers (the rest being PP, PE, PS or ABS). Main constraints: raw material must be moist and should not contain any pieces of wood or other impurities. The length of the cut grass should range between 4 and 8 cm. According to Alexandre Poignant, the main advantages of this raw material used to produce injected parts are ""a very competitive price, improved stability of the shape, stiffness and abrasion resistance of formed parts, plain color - which can be a real plus - an almost non-existent smell due to a high degree of purification of fibers, but also the reduction of the weight of the finished products and, most of all, the possibility of waste disposal with no left over residue, by the means of combustion or biological degradation"". ""The product catalog from Joycos, is surely today the most comprehensive one regarding ranges of airless containers, and its ability to manufacture airtight make-up cases suits exactly market demand,"" underlines Alexandre Poignant."
BeautyFULL Club: a dynamic program for 2010,"Premium Beauty News - Not so easy to develop a new club during crisis times Charles-Emmanuel Gounod - It’s true and you’re right. However, the BeautyFULL Club proved quite resistant to the economic storm that shook and is still shaking our sector. I remind you that the sector’s activity has never decreased so deeply since the 1930s.  And it’s probably why an initiative such as the BeautyFULL Club was really needed.  Actually, what a better time than these dire times for professionals of the beauty sector to gather themselves, discuss, and having a better view of the future? Today, we have around sixty members.  And they are very motivated: just consider the success of our information breakfasts.  There are many companies interested in joining us.  Our concern is to balance the number of members from the supply side with members from the customer side. Premium Beauty News - Actually the year 2009 was quite chaotic for the beauty sector Charles-Emmanuel Gounod - Yes, but I’d like to insist that, in such a context, our members are even more convinced of the usefulness and the relevancy of a club like ours.  And our programme for the year 2010 can demonstrate this point.  More than ever, we have the will to be the main meeting point of our sector. Premium Beauty News - So let’s talk about this programme Charles-Emmanuel Gounod - The club’s website is now fully operational and our members can use discussion forums. Of course, we plan to organise and even accelerate the frequency of our breakfasts (almost one per month) and to organise several lunch-debates. Regarding other actions, we also plan: – A wider opening toward young professionals and the new professions, through the creation of a junior membership for those less than 35 year-old, in order to bring them competences and allow them to stand by a high level professional network. In this context, we are considering to cooperate with several graduate schools.
– The creation at the end of 2010 of a BeautyFULL Club Award with an award ceremony honouring creative and development teams."
The European ambitions of Topline Products,"Four years in a row (from 2006 to 2009), Topline Products was acknowledged as being one of the 50 best performing companies in New Jersey. And last year Charles Chang decided to extend the influence of his company to Europe by opening an office in Paris. Premium Beauty News - If we look into the story of Topline, we end up understanding that you anticipated what appears today as being one of the biggest shifts of the beauty industry worldwide, namely the strategy of beauty brands in having almost completely recourse to subcontractors. Charles Chang - True, I very quickly had the feeling that perfumery and cosmetics brands would more frequently resort to this type of sub-contracting. This was in the nature of things. Because the first vocation of these companies is to create concepts, products, promote them and market them. If they can find an efficient organization allowing them to reduce constraints related to production and logistics. Why should they do without? A pioneer, yes! We were as of early 1980s, one of the first few companies in the world to work with orient in the cosmetic packaging containers. In the mid-1990s, we were the pioneer of introducing quality filled cosmetics from China to the US market. Premium Beauty News - What has changed over the last few years is that this range of services has even coupled with an offer in terms of complete standard lines, including formulations. Charles Chang - Absolutely! And this is what has propelled us to where we are today. A company able to perform a complete full service offer with a true creative vocation. May I remind you that we own more than 25 patents in the United States and worldwide. Premium Beauty News - Some of your product innovations have helped you build your reputation. Charles Chang - That’s right! We even received prestigious awards. I can name the ""Dual Hinged Compact"", a Topline patented product adopted by L’Oreal, but also the Infaillible Lipstick tube/ Lip Gloss duo also designed for L’Oreal, Max Factor Loose Powder Jar with Brush for P&G, not to mention the French Manicure Pen for Sephora. And we are also proud of being the first full service supplier for Estée Lauder with the supply of a complete make-up palette made in China in 2003. Premium Beauty News - To achieve this you need an industrial tool? Charles Chang - The tool itself is not enough! You must focus on performance each time. Innovation springs from, both the development of our formulations, or of course, from packaging and distribution systems. As for the industrial tool, it is sizeable. As of 1995, we opened our first 100% owned factory in Shanghai, now specialized in metal processing, which manufactures, among others products, the eyelash curler for Maybeline, Cover Girl and Max Factor, not to mention metal compacts. Also in 1998, we integrated the production of cosmetic ingredients. We are now able to make complete line of colour cosmetics. In 2000, we added a new production unit, this time dedicated to plastic injection, which now has no fewer than 150 presses, not to mention all the finishing material to manufacture indifferently, compacts, closures, jars, lipstick tubes lipgloss etc... It operates with some 1,500 people. In 2002 we opened a third facility dedicated to brushes and powder puffs. And today we can produce everything, or so. Premium Beauty News - Your customers were mostly Americans? Charles Chang - At the beginning, yes essentially! But things have changed considerably in recent years. Firstly, the companies in the beauty industry have become global companies. We can no longer say that such and such group is now American, English or French ... Factories are everywhere, as are marketing teams and the demand has become global too. Our customers operate all around the world, and their names are L’Oreal, Avon, Estée Lauder, Lancôme, Sephora, Mary Kay, P&G, Inter Parfums, etc. Insofar as our offer also includes quality standards asked for by these same brands, they turn to us. This explains why we had to open last year, a European base in Paris, headed by Jean-Robert Bonneil, who has an experience of more than 15 years in our sector and has a very good knowledge of the market and its European operators. Our presence in Europe is, of course, fully justified because on the one hand our customers are global and operating here, on the other hand Europe remains the largest market in the world for beauty. The growing acceptability of the made in China full service by European consumers has confirmed our choice to tap into this market. Furthermore, Topline has a unique expertise covering both packaging and product"
"“Our industry must focus on innovation,” Ulrich Griebel, Schwan STABILO Cosmetics","Premium Beauty News - What are Schwan STABILO Cosmetics’ main assets today? Ulrich Griebel - Schwan STABILO remains the global leader in cosmetic pencils. This is not such an obvious fact, because the current market is totally different from what it was 5 or 10 years ago. Basically, there are more players. But we started very early to expand our regional base to international sites. We produce where our markets are the most dynamic. It is a well-tested strategy.  We currently have six sites abroad. The latest to date, which was founded in 2008 is located in Mexico. It’s a very important market, since it represented just a short time ago the largest Latin American market. It has since been surpassed by Brazil, where we have been producing successfully for some time now. Our strategy has proved all its efficiency, particularly during the crisis last year. Given that economically speaking, Latin America is on a strong upward slope, the crisis has been much less severe there than in North America or Europe. This is also true for Asia. Schwan STABILO thus profits from a good situation on the international stage. We certainly feel the effects of crisis, especially in the United States, where even large companies yet well established and stable, specialized in consumer goods and marketing products having nothing to do with the segment of luxury goods, had to cope with a decrease of 7 to 8%. Schwan STABILO managed to maintain its position. We ended the last fiscal year with over 180 million Euros in turnover. Of course we undoubtedly recorded a 2% decline in comparison with the previous year, but we were also able to consolidate our financial data and financial base through an appropriate liquidity management and we are currently enjoying a more advantageous and safer situation than a year ago. So much for the broad lines. Our core operations remain unchanged (we are in this respect undoubtedly very regular, persistent and resistant): cosmetic pencils. These include traditional wooden pencils, cosmetic pencils to sharpen with a plastic cap, slim size mechanical pencils and our liquid eyeliners (fluid products) in the form of cosmetic free ink and ink eyeliners. Not forgetting our mascaras, which is a sector with a very positive development in recent years and which is on the brink of becoming an integral part of our core business. Premium Beauty News - What were the last main industrial investments? Ulrich Griebel - As I said, we successfully opened a new production site in Mexico last year. A production plant for state-of-the-art plastic injection, and dedicated to new technologies (such as 2K technique), and worth 6 million Euros, was also founded in Weissenburg (Germany). In addition, we are fully involved in the development of decoration processes. An approach that represents quite a challenge, since ""raw"" pencils offers little scope for variation. It is therefore especially important to create clear differentiations and to provide added value to cosmetic pencils through innovative designs or visual and haptic effects. Furthermore, we have heavily invested in the area of liquid products (liquid eyeliners). There is an array of new models (such as ""Dip-Pens""), a large number of inks, newly developed shades and a lot more. Another field of action and a considerable challenge was the one concerning reformulation of cosmetic formulaes in order to satisfy current legislation. I am referring in particular to D5 (Decamethylcyclopentasiloxan). A well-known basic raw material used in large quantities, particularly in cosmetics where it is still authorized, but will probably be banned in some countries, as of next year. In this context, we were able to suggest outline solutions going even beyond the simple substitution of D5. In addition to the first approach consisting in the replacement of D5 by a suitable component, we managed, using D5-free ingredients, to enhance products characteristics. At the same time, we also solved the issue concerning PVC-free packing materials and are operating on the market with these products. This point is also solved. If you consider all these compliance issues which also have an effect upon various laws, and they were quite a few of them in the past 2 years we have obtained, indiscriminately, good solutions, we are already active on the market with our products and thanks to them, we will surely win some market shares in 2010. Premium Beauty News - What were Schwan’s most important launches of the year 2009? Ulrich Griebel - Actually, 2009 didn’t give us the opportunity for new processes, but it will be much more remembered as a year where many unsolved issues where ended up, such as the D5, I just spoke about, the future of which in the branch was already uncertain for 3 or 4 years, destabilizing the cosmetics industry and regularly generating policy changes. Up to now, there were no good answers, but we addressed many topics of this kind in 2009 in order to devote ourselves now serenely to innovative and promising themes. Premium Beauty News - Don’t you think that the current economic context might hinder efforts toward sustainability? What objectives your group has set in the environmental area? Ulrich Griebel - There’s no doubt about that. The start-ups that gradually imposed themselves on the market and more specifically in the segments of organic cosmetics, sustainability and environmental friendliness are certainly still present. But the strong trend that emerged 1 or 2 years ago which was behind the strong interest regarding this topic has currently dropped. In this regard, we notice a back to basics trend. However, on the other hand, we notice that companies that were already operating in this sector in the past and who have been following these issues for several years, remain active. They continue to grow even in times of crisis, maybe more slowly than before, but they are growing and we assume that in the medium and long term, topics focused on environment will have fully or more easily imposed themselves. In this segment, Schwan STABILO’s development is proven, but there are no major changes. We have for instance, a wide range of Ecocert certified products, in other words we can now offer our full range of pencils to sharpen as natural cosmetic products and also as products certified according to Ecocert standards, not just with one single texture, but with many more in a various number of categories. At the same time, we are also developing the sectors of mascaras, liquids eyeliners and mechanical pencils. Premium Beauty News - In your opinion, what trends will strongly impact the cosmetics sector within the next years? Ulrich Griebel - I think we should make a distinction here between the near future and what may impact the industry far beyond. What 2010 has in store for us is already clearly visible. Competition in this sector is likely to be tougher than ever. All brands, all manufacturers are struggling market shares. We notice in some markets that the segment of luxury goods, which was almost spared during all the economic cycles, in recent years, seems this time more impacted. Moreover, there is no certainty that consumers will return to old traditional consumption patterns once the economic crisis is over. Therefore, there may well be a chance that the retail sector generates gaps within segments, resulting in a significant increase in pressure on distribution channels as well as a much stronger pressure applied by distribution channels themselves.  Between providers and brands, we are witnessing an unrestrained price war. Undoubtedly, this struggle, is currently ruling the whole industry! Premium Beauty News - What message would you like to pass on to the whole beauty industry at the end of 2009? Ulrich Griebel - To be quite honest, my message is quite clear. Price competition, battles to win market shares through product discounting are, in my view, conceivable, but in the medium and long term, the all-important issue will be to know how to attract male and female consumers in stores. Here again, it seems clear that consumers of both sexes will only enter stores if they are sure to find captivating, exciting and thrilling products. If they are just less expensive, then we will witness, in the short or medium term, a withholding of purchases and a buyers’ strike. Customers will no longer buy a product simply because it’s cheaper or more convenient, regardless of the brand. Industry must pick up the thread of innovation to fill again with wonder new consumers of both sexes. Price war can only be an interlude. Premium Beauty News - As a conclusion, what would you expect for Schwan STABILO Cosmetics in the year 2010? Ulrich Griebel - We expect a stabilization next year. Changes will definitely take place. Changes between some segments, changes in supply chains, changes in customer relations, but all this will stabilize itself in 2010. The landscape will probably be somewhat different in some places and I think we will then reach a new base enabling us to move forward in the direction of promising key themes focusing on products concepts, customer orientation and innovation. Interview by Dr. Kerstin Lötzerich-Bernhard (December 2009)"
International Lacquers becomes I.L. Cosmetics,"With 11 million euros of investment in five years, nearly half the annual turnover of his company (23 million Euros), including six million by 2011, Jean-François Harpes, CEO and owner of International Lacquers (IL), seems to be unaware of the crisis. Actually, market figures are self-explanatory. The market of nail polish has increased steadily between 2008 and 2009 (8% in Germany). In present times, such dynamism is almost sheer provocation. The famous “lipstick effect” seems to have also fully impacted the nail segment. And icing on the cake, the situation is the same for mascara, lip gloss and eyeliner. Areas where, precisely, Jean-François Harpes has diversified his business in 1999 and 2003 by creating successively a filling / packaging unit, Interpack, and a production unit for make-up products, Luxcos. ""This diversification matches IL’s desire to provide customers with a wide range of products in full service, thereby enhancing its philosophy of value for money. Actually, the supply chain system manages projects from their initiation to their final delivery, which allows a step by step monitoring and an appropriate answer to each client,"" he says. This diversification allows IL to rely on a 50/50 distribution of its turnover with the help of make-up, in the next five years, while enamel still currently accounts for 80%. ""Make-up, says Jean-François Harpes, is already on a six million euro trend in turnover by the end of 2010"" Under these conditions, International Lacquers could no longer bear the same name. “ From the beginning of 2010, we will change the group’s name to IL Cosmetics and keep International Lacquers for enamels, Luxcos for make-up and Interpack for packaging with a supply chain approach”, Jean-François Harpes says, “which doesn’t fundamentally change things a lot since our customers were already widely using the contraction of our denomination”. At the same time, IL reinforces both its quality and technical team, and sales team, and will be certified ISO 9001 at the end of next year. “The Full-Service axis will be more clearly identified at the beginning of next year, but IL Cosmetics will continue to invest heavily in the production with the goal to shift from 300 million to 450 million units of nail polishes and 20 million to 40 million units in make-up!” IL Cosmetics hopes to double its production capacity in the nail polish, mascara, eyeliner and lip gloss segments. With strong assets on a dynamic market, IL has made what is necessary to supply it, in particular the mass market where the company has a real expertise."
Leoplast: the bioplastic axis,"Leoplast’s managers were required a lot of courage to let their company take a completely new course. Nonetheless, their company, based in the area of Turin, dealing in plastic injection and specialized in cosmetic packaging, entered into the era of bioplastics in 2004. ""Courage, I don’t know, he explains, but will, surely! Anyway we had no other choice. There was a chance that our traditional markets slipped to Asia. Our costs were becoming prohibitive. It was absolutely necessary to find new ways and most of all pull out one day, of resins derived from fossil fuels, petrochemical plastic"". Leoplast’s good fortune was to be situated at the heart of the most active area in Italy (Piedmont), in terms of organic farming and environmental issues. There’s even a polytechnic centre in Turin specialized in the study and processing of agro-plastics with whom Leoplast collaborates. Five years later, the Italian firm converts about 12% of its products in vegetal plastics and 10% in regenerated plastic. “These figures may seem meaningless, but in fact it’s extremely encouraging, says Graziano Reggiani. Simply because only the smaller players in the industry made the shift first. Larger players are  starting to wake-up.”  And it’s quite a concern ... seeing the big ones waking-up. Because investments involved require necessarily larger markets than the small or medium quantities only ordered by the more modest players in the market. Also a good way to make more competitive a technology and products whose costs may still seem prohibitive (+ 30% to 40% on average). In five years, the ground covered, technically, by the Italian company was considerable. Because transforming plastics from plants is far from simple. The choice of Leoplast focused essentially on 100% vegetal ingredients derived agro-materials. The cycle times are slower, production waste is more important, ""materials"" are subject to ""shrinkage"" after injection, problems related to static electricity, mastering transformation temperatures etc.. Not to mention the narrowness of the suppliers market for raw material that still comes down to two or three major players. ""Today we have our business well under control"", explains says Graziano Reggiani. Since 2007, the company markets a full line of make-up (lipstick tubes, compact, eye shadow) which is 100% Ingeo based (polilactic acid). Leoplast, even launched recently a mascara with a bioplastic brush and stem and a glass vial. To note also, in joint venture with Socoplas, another Italian plastic bottle convertor, the marketing of a bottle with its closure (made by Leoplast) in PLA and cellulose acetate. Confident in the future? ""More than ever, insists Graziano Reggiani. We really feel that the market is starting to react. And we have a comfortable lead""."
Axilone triples its capacity in China,"Since last July, Axilone, Ileos Group, has given itself the means to triple its production capacity in China by making operational a new building of 16 000 sqm. Main activity of the plant, the production of lipstick tubes and caps (metal and plastic) for perfumery and cosmetics. The ambition of the French group is to become a major player in the global industry of lipstick tubes exploiting fully the synergy of metal and plastic. In order to achieve this, Axilone has just released a new mechanism of 11 mm in diameter much more efficient. In addition to its factories in China, Spain (specialized in metal stamping), Axilone also owns two more factories in France, in Auray and Guidel (caps, compacts), with a acknowledged expertise in the field of bi-injection and Surlyn and PCTG processing."
Intercos seeks always more creativity,"""Nothing will be the same anymore and we must be more than ever creative and efficient in terms of products ... more responsive also to quickly respond market requirements"", explains Dario Ferrari, for whom this crisis, however, occurred at a time when the industrial position of Intercos was ""totally stabilized worldwide"". ""Our industrial tools are operating perfectly, which is not the case, the least we can say, with many businesses in the sector where the equipment is often obsolete. We are solidly established in the United States where our capacity doubled last year.  In Europe, and especially in Italy, where we surely have one of the most modern production unit in the world. We will surely be operating in Brazil in the coming months, a country where we are already very much in demand. Finally, we are reaping the benefits of our presence in China, where as you remember, we currently have four plants. For our customers is means security. This part of the world already weighs more than 10% of our industrial turnover and I think that with the kind of growth rate we are experiencing, it could represent half of our industrial activity in seven years "". For this reason, it is in this part of the world and from this region, according to Dario Ferrari, that many things relevant of the cosmetic world will be at stake, if only the huge market that it represents and the competition it will cause between suppliers from all parts of the world. ""This is one reason, he says, that led us to think over our strategic and commercial approach by creating as of next year, a new division, Smart Beauty, with the aim of offering complete standard lines ( including packaging), very innovative and with attractive prices ... Clearly, we want to tap into the market of competitors dealing in packaging and promotional items"". But Dario Ferrari underlines that Intercos’s first asset ""remains and will always remain in the ability to find and develop new formulas."" And at this level, the Italian company does not appear to lack imagination. ""Next year, we will again market nearly 150 new products. Our activity is also very sound in the universe of pencils where we will continue to strengthen ourselves, and our development strategy on the skincare segment is particularly promising with new products and designs planned for next year""."
MWV continues to grow in airless and reinforces its production in Mexico,"Premium Beauty News – Broadly speaking, it seems that crisis has not too much impacted MWV’s performance. Why? Thomas Jonas - Unfortunately crisis has not spared us by sheer magic! However, we reacted very quickly and we immediately adjusted our industrial tool to the new market reality. As you remember, my responsibilities cover at the same time the whole dispensing part, namely, pumps (perfumery / cosmetics, personal care, etc..) for all applications and the pistol activity (triggers), but also the cardboard processing activity. And on the whole, it’s true, we will undoubtedly be one of the few companies in the universe of packaging to record better results this year than in 2008! The main reason, beyond reorganizations, is the diversity of our business portfolio. The very strong demand related to H1N1 influenza with soap pumps where we are leaders, and taking market share in the European cardboard market or in cosmetic pumps, has helped us counterbalance the downfall experienced by the Perfume industry this year. We also notice that some new market segments are attracted by the pump, which allows our customers to reinforce the functionality of their packaging and therefore the value perceived by consumers. Premium Beauty News - Of course people speak a lot of theincreasing demand for airless systems, with a market expected to double in the three next years. This must help quite a lot to boost the business you inherited from the Keltec company, when you took it over three years ago. Thomas Jonas – Quite true! The ground covered in three years time, is impressive. The whole production part, initially at Keltec in Holland, was dispatched and redeveloped in several sites worldwide to be closer to the needs of our customers. Spain, of course, where we have a historic factory in Barcelona, then Asia and now Mexico. Each of these units is set up on the same model in terms of production capacity to cope, you are right, with strong demand. Our ability to produce globally our airless systems offers flexibility to our customers for their launches, and this is one of our specificity. The Research and Developments Center for Airless stayed in Holland, where there is a very creative team. Premium Beauty News - Your airless range is like no other Thomas Jonas – Actually, our technology is built around the Rolling Bellow that combines several functions in one single piece, thanks to its unique design. There is no metal spring, which eliminates some compatibility problems. The Luna and Pearl lines that range from 30 ml to 150 ml, offer an excellent evacuation rate and are easy to fill. Premium Beauty News - Everyone is currently working on new airless designs. Particularly for new shapes. Of course it is your case too? Thomas Jonas - Indeed! And some of these novelties should be created next year. Moreover, I insist on the fact that the Rolling Bellow technology is suitable for the development of new shapes."
Toly wants to be a major player in airless !,"Just a short flashback ... Five years ago, Toly only owned one factory in Malta.  Today, the Toly Group has four manufacturing plants and nine sales offices worldwide. Toly’s manufacturing plant in Malta employs some three hundred people and operates forty-five injection moulding machines. Investment in the Malta plant is constant; just last August Toly announced plans to construct a new ultra modern eco unit. Toly’s Chinese plant in Shenzhen, which opened four years ago, currently employs two hundred people and operates some nineteen injection moulding machines, primarily producing compacts and various caps and closures. In India, Toly has set up base in a new manufacturing facility, which opened at the end of 2008. The plant, located in Dehradun is the first Western packaging supplier in the field of make-up and today consists of a hundred employees and eleven brand new injection moulding machines, producing closures and caps, lipstick tubes and Kajal pencils. Last but not least is Toly’s fourth manufacturing plant. Located in Korea, it specialises in the production of  airless packaging. This area of the Toly Group, known asTAP- Toly Airless Packaging consists of seventy employees and thirteen injection machines. Airless, a niche market, in which Toly has every intention of becoming one of the market leaders.""One of the component in terms of innovation"", explains Andy Gatesy, CEO,"" implies new airless concepts and new shapes. And to play with shapes, there is only one solution, you must use systems with a pouch"". This is one of the reasons why the Korean factory was recently equipped with a new assembly line with pouches. During various presentations throughout the world, the company was able to recently display containers very different in shapes and sizes like airless jars, mini airless systems, slimline airless, double-wall airless, a new airless closing system, etc. .... An expertise which will also include pump manufacturing and assembling. Mascara and lipgloss, a segment for which the Group has announced the construction over the coming months, of a production unit for vials, in its factory in Malta. ""Knowing that we will outsource the production of brushes to industry specialists"", says Andy Gatesy,"" we will also work with suppliers in Taiwan and Korea to offer an extensive standard range, and we still have a strong alliance with our Japanese partner Sinwa"". The company is currently working on a new range of applicators which will be launched in 2010. Several development strategies that must not let us forget that the firm is always very active on traditional areas such as make-up boxes. It has designed this year some 25 new standard lines including an eco-friendly range with a 50% composition based on wood fibres. Not forgetting a whole range of new palettes for Dior, Sephora, Yves Rocher, Jemma Kidd etc..."
"SGD Asia: ""managing growth""","SGD in Asia is worth EUR 30 million in turnover, a furnace with a 60 000 tonne capacity per year to supply five production lines, 800 staff and a double-digit growth. Some data to better understand what Cyril Ruiz Moise, Deputy General Manager, VP Sales, modestly calls ""managing growth"". The plant owned by the SGD group in China produces both glass for the perfumery and cosmetic industry (50%) and pharmacy. Three lines are dedicated to the perfumery and cosmetic segment, the production of which is sent to Asia (80%) with China as preferred customer. ""China is a country where local brands are starting to grow strongly"", says Cyril Ruiz Moise, ""this explains the growth rates we are experiencing, bearing in mind that, all the same, we were starting from scratch in 2006, when we decided to give a perfume-orientation to the factory"". In particular, the brands of the Jahwa group, some of them having an international vocation, brands for which SGD Asia supplied a wide range of bottles. ""It is true that this growth might surprise many, admit people at SGD Asia, but is important to note that our tool still has strong reserve capacities"". Latest investments to date, in 2006, the workshop dedicated to decoration, the equipment of facilities used for finishing techniques in clean atmosphere and the implementation of quality control tools. Main orientation in 2009 for the Asian entity of the French glassmaker, to focus on more standards, with a brand new range just unveiled in Hong Kong during the last Cosmoprof Asia."
Jackel: the “full service” offer is a key axis!,"Premium Beauty News - Jackel has significantly improved its full service offer. The scope of your business now goes far beyond packaging. Vanessa Lecomte - Our formulation and packaging activity began in 2002 with our first plant, JV Cosmetics located in the area of Guangdong (Southern China). It was dedicated to makeup. In 2007, we moved the factory to Zhangmutou, still in southern China, to broaden our activity to the formulation of skin care products and packaging of OTC products and perfume. Until September 2008, this activity was primarily developed on the U.S. market - less reluctant to Made in China labels - thanks to the impulse given by our client Elizabeth Arden, who relied on us for the production of a large number of blockbusters and promotional references. In September 2008, we opened ourselves to the European market in particular by improving the quality of our formulations. The outcome is that today we have a catalogue of about forty classic and mineral formulations. Premium Beauty News - What is your offer in the universe of makeup? Vanessa Lecomte - A wide array of formulations ""by Jackel"". On the one hand, the classics: lipsticks, gloss, mascara, eyeliners, eye shadows (cream, mousse and powder), concealers, illuminators, foundation, complexion correctors, blush, cooked blush, bronzing powders, loose powders, pressed powders and eyebrow powders. On the other hand, the minerals: lipsticks, gloss, eye shadow, blush, loose powders (face and cheeks), and pressed powders. Premium Beauty News - What is the size of your production tool? Vanessa Lecomte - A plant of 22 000 sqm for 300 employees with a building dedicated to makeup and care and another building dedicated to perfume packaging. The factory is certified cGMP, GMPC as well as ISO 9001 and has a laboratory dedicated to formulation and another one for chemical and microbiological testing. It allows us great flexibility in production of quantities, ranging from small to large series. In France, we are working with a expert in toxicology for the set up of the cosmetic files and we have a partnership agreement with a French laboratory, to propose Made in France formulations that we then pack in China. Premium Beauty News - Can you name some products illustrating you full service offer? Vanessa Lecomte - Among many others: Paco by Paco Rabanne, a miniature coffret by Calvin Klein, Viva la Juicy (solid perfume) by Juicy Couture, Lipsticks from Jean d’Estrées’ mineral Collection, Infinite Bronze by Lancaster, set boxes for bath products for NEXT and PUPA, etc... Premium Beauty News - Eventually, how would you summarize the benefits of Jackel’s full service offer? Vanessa Lecomte - For each project, we provide a single interlocutor.  The optimization of costs and scheduling in formulation and packaging. A competitive service. And the benefice of a relay supplier for the growing Chinese market."
Launches: Bormioli Luigi’s know-how,"Each year, Bormioli Luigi illustrates the variety of its competences through a simple idea: showcasing the latest launches of prestigious products in which the company participated Premium Beauty News has selected some of the most illustrative examples, with the explanations of the glassmaker on its work. The latest addition in Boss’ woman’s perfumes collection is simply called Boss. The feminine interpretation of the design is clearly intelligible by the shape of the bottle, where a series of jewels are put in a line, contoured and enclosed by a shiny metallic band, which encapsulates the precious content. The chromatic contrast between the cold metal finishing and the warmth of the bottle is entrusted to a coloured glass, whose shading goes from rose to orange. The overall outline of the creation consists of a tall, geometrical bottle developed upon a small and squared base.  The facets that sculpt the shape of the gems are smooth and clean, well defined by sharp edges.  The first jewel at the base of the bottle is solid, meaning that the glass fills it completely. This accomplishment presented several issues to overcome for the glassmaker.  “Such a tall and narrow shape easily tends to incline, jeopardizing the stability of the bottle. We needed to limit the usual dimensional tolerances used in the field, assuring the complete verticality of the bottle,” Bormioli Luigi explains. “Furthermore, the finishing adopted, namely the metallic band which contours the profile, winding the glass through the base, was a threat for the stability of the bottle. Considering that the design required a smooth glass profile, where no recess could be added to host the metal, and knowing that the tolerances involved in the metal stitching are larger than in glass blowing, the precision of the making had to be absolute, preventing any failure.” A logo engraved onto the metallic band and then a plastic stopper representing the same ornamental motifs featured in the bottles complete this nice and original fragrance bottle.

Year of launch: 2009 The new fragrance in Baldessarini range, which claims to be strictly reserved to men (not women, not boys), keeps a orm of consistency with the brand’s prior creations. An imposing and sober bottle is the imprinting of the Baldessarini signature. The shape is traditional, marked by the adoption of a black glass, only enriched by a golden plate showing the engraved logo. Under a technical point of view, the dig wide room at the centre of the main wall is forcedly absolutely plane, in order to perfectly fit with the metal plate. The combination of sharp edges and dark colour of glass, turning into intricacies, pushed the glassmaker to develop some original techniques to detect glass irregularities and defectiveness,  in order to ensure the highest level of quality.

Year of launch: 2009 True is the latest addition in American Eagle men’s fragrances range. Immediately at a glance the look of the bottle reveals the consumer it is targeted for: the young and sporty, dynamic man. The bottle, with a strong aspect, is a rectangular container where the pureness of glass melts with the cold energy of the steel and the technical yet enjoying touch of the black rubber. “This making presented many constraints,” explains Bormioli Luigi’s staff The manufacturing starts from a heavy mass of glass, “whose behaviour would suit more rounded shapes; nonetheless this bottle features very small details to be carved in the glass surfaces, namely the rough side wall”.  Actually, the squared yet embroidered shape imposed the adoption of a complex and tricky moulding system. “This ensures the exact interpretation and cleanliness of the edges and  facets, in order for the special silver spray superposed to achieve a mirror-like effect, through the inside of the back glass panel”. Indeed, what Bormioli Luigi calls a “remarkable achievement” allows the back, sprayed silver panel, to stay opaque, while allowing the inside of the same panel the shiny reflection, through which the dark grey front logo to actually be seen twice: on the front panel where the screening took place, and, through the inside back panel, where it’s full reflection can be seen clearly, as if through a mirror. The bottle is finally completed by a black logo standing on the glass face and it is topped by a round and imposing stopper, made of a chromed body coated with black rubber. Line: American Eagle

Year of launch: 2009 A few years after the launch of the first fragrance for woman, Costume National is presenting its first fragrance for men, simply called Homme. The bottle design recalls the original shape of the feminine one. However, the bottle profile is taller and roughly squared. It seems that the designer, starting from the base of a squashed parallelepiped whose edges are well rounded, had pushed the centre of the bottle with his thumbs, keeping its perimeter with the other fingers. The result is that the two glass faces are coherently deformed, the front one concave and the rear convex. The thin mass of glass used allows appreciating the continuous varying camber of the edges, crowning in an absolute original design. No parting lines are visible. The bottle is then personalized with a simple yet elegant platinum logo, and topped by a small chromed cap, almost in an effort to keep a minimalist styling. “A similar shape is very far from the normal capabilities of the equipments, and it took a lot of the man skills to have the glass blown with aesthetical coherence inside the bottle. Very often indeed  the apparently simplest shapes are the most hard to reproduce in glassmaking,” says the company. Line: Costume National

Year of launch: 2009 The first men’s fragrance from the Spanish fashion designer follows one year later the launch of the woman perfume. The look of the bottle melts traditional shapes, namely the glass container, with different materials and styles, giving origin to a well recognizable product. The glass container is an imposing rectangular bottle, with a thick and regular distribution of the glass at the base and along the vertical walls. The geometric inspiration of the creation is enhanced by a metal plate inserted into a glass recess, just above the logo of the designer, the latter also being engraved in the main facet of the bottle. The glass is sprayed all around the base in an emerald green, gradating to total transparency towards the middle of the glass shape. The bottle is eventually topped by an outstanding cap, chromed and glittering. “During the production of the bottle, many cares had to be paid in order to respect the strict tolerances the housing of the plate  required. This particular was quite intricate to solve in relation with the weight of the mass of glass we were working with.” Line: Custo Barcelona

Year of launch: 2009 The new fragrance in Grigioperla line, the men’s brand from the renowned Italian lingerie house for woman, turns up in a bottle characterized by the dark green colour of the glass contrasting with the platinum accessories. The bottle has a oval shape, where the sides are cut and defined by plane facets. The rear wall features a number of sharp engraved lines, looking like a piece of garment. On the smooth front wall, the logo of the brand is silk screen printed in platinum. The bottle is crowned by a chromed dispensing system that leans on a well-matched support hiding the glass shoulder.
The whole is made of a few and essential lines, aiming a sober elegance. “Original solutions were applied to enable the tooling opening, due to the presence of dig shoulders and sharp vertical edges. The respect of strict tolerances was another constraint that proved the ability of our skilled glass technicians,” claims Bormioli Luigi’s staff. Line: GrigioPerla

MWV announces production of Melodie pump in Mexico,"MeadWestvaco (MWV), the group of American origin specialized among many other activities, in the production of dispensing systems, sprayers (pumps, dispensers, trigger sprayers, etc.) announced that a production line for its low profile Melodie pump would be in operation during the first half of 2010 in Mexico. In addition, managers at MWV said they were quite satisfied with the commercial development of their snap-on model Melodie Clikit IP (IP stands for Plastic Injection) which seems to clearly meet market requirements for customer oriented solutions. The Clikit IP does has the advantage of actually being a pump ""dressed with plastic,"" the ferrule of the actuator and the spray pump cover being manufactured with the same plastic can be decorated and customized at will with all finishing techniques available for plastic, including the sublimation technique. ""We are witnessing a real craze from customers for this new pump"", explains Laurent Bourgoin, VP Sales and Marketing Europe Fragrance at MWV. Perfume brand owners have already shown a keen interest in this innovation and have begun tests on their filling lines. A pump which, according to managers from MWV, could very much account, in the mid term, for approximately 10% of total sales of perfumery pumps worldwide. Another development axis for MWV, the launch of a version of Melodie with an Europa 4 screw ring. ""There again, it is meeting market demand for a more environmentally-friendly pump, i.e. which can be unscrewed by the end consumer to allow dissociation of the pump from the glass bottle"", explains Laurent Bourgoin. Finally, the group also showcased at Luxe Pack Monaco an even wider range of extensions for inserts ranging from 9.3 mm to 36.7 mm including telescopic extensions which of course answer market demand for customizing the lengths of extensions in spray-caps. This innovation allows cost effective customization and at the same time reduction of the development process. Also note in the group’s catalogue, an extension in its airless range (Aria Airless and Prelude Airless) as well as the marketing of two mini-trigger sprayers ""Mini-Trigger"" very ergonomic for bottles intended to contain, for example sun care or hair care products;"
DuPont celebrates its innovations,"The Luxe Pack show in Monaco was an opportunity for DuPont to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Surlyn, its featured polymer. This year, DuPont has extended the capabilities of its overmoulding technology, Surlyn 3D, (the 3 Ds standing for Design, Decoration and Depth) to provide greater freedom to the designers of inner and outer perfume containers or packaging of cosmetics products and body care products. People at DuPont explain that ""In addition to new shapes and colors, new material combinations are possible to improve barrier properties and chemical resistance according to ingredients and application. This will allow customers to create packaging providing glass-like transparency, luxury decorative effects and increased consumer safety and convenience that simultaneously reflect brand identity and achieve product differentiation"". Among the many examples of implementation of Surlyn showcased at the DuPont stand: the very airy line of the new Kenzo Amour designed by Texen. Starting out clear from the bottom of the bottle, the white lacquer gradually becomes thicker towards the top of the bottle, where it reaches maximum opacity. In contrast, the cap, which is opaque at its base, becomes increasingly translucent until it is totally clear at the top. In other material, and among the leading products using DuPont products, the new standard mascara packaging line from German manufacturer, Oekametall which uses DuPont Biomax PTT1100 (PolyTrimethylTerephthalate), a new bio-material. It is a polyester-type resin with a renewably-sourced content and performance similar to polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). ""With a very glossy surface explain managers at DuPont, this product offers excellent resistance to common formulations for cosmetic products""."
Aesthete creates Aesthete Lab and teams up with Open D for MAD,"For Thierry de Baschmakoff and the Aesthete team, historically a creative agency dedicated to the design of luxury products, it actually represents two new starts. First start, the creation of Aesthete Lab, a creative agency dedicated to brands looking for a privileged partnership. Second start, the creation with Laurent Caucé, CEO and founder of the group Open D, of a new agency, MAD (Massive Artistic Direction), who will accompany clients in their product development to the point of sale, and who will work both on selective projects and in the mass distribution sector. Thus, each partner hopes to benefit from the other partner’s networks, Laurent Caucé from the excellent implantation of Aesthete in luxury markets, and Thierry de Baschmakoff from the international network of Open D and its presence in the Health & Beauty sector. Premium Beauty News - Like many beautiful stories, your new adventure began with a meeting! Thierry de Baschmakoff – Truly a meeting that occurred at the right moment. Aesthete could no longer just remain on the segment of luxury products design where, precisely, Laurent Caucé needed to extend the influence of his agency. May I remind you that regarding this historical business core of Aesthete, we are still one of the few agencies mastering techniques as varied as glass, leather, watch-making, new materials, which allows us to manage projects globally , from the drawing board to the finished product with a methodology ranging from brand analysis, volume design, graphic design, prototypes and technical service. Laurent Caucé - This is obviously what attracted my partners and myself. So we were able to very quickly elaborate with Thierry the outlines of what could become a business partnership. A few words on Open D... We operate since 2002. At the time, the idea was quite simple: create an agency specialized in Design Merchandising and Retail in the cosmetics and perfumery segment. In fact, develop ourselves where other design agencies did not venture since they did not go beyond the stage of ""product"" designing. As for manufacturers specialized in POS or store layouts, they had, to say the least, an overly industrial idea of the subject, not creative enough. And I must say that facts have proved us right. Three years later, in 2005, we opened our first branch in Dubai. In 2006, Barcelona. In 2007, Singapore and, in 2008, New York. Next step ... in 2010, with Shanghai. In 2008, we created a packaging department, Open pack, which proved itself useful in 2 years time and recently merged with Aesthete to create MAD. Today, Open D is worth some 10 million Euros in turnover with a workforce of 70 people. Our clients are L’Oreal, Procter & Gamble, Coty, Diageo, Inter Parfums, Richemont, LVMH… The company relies on three key activities: the ephemeral furniture (30% of turnover), permanent furniture (50% of turnover) and commercial architecture (20% of turnover). Premium Beauty News - And crisis ? Don’t you fell its impact? Laurent Caucé - Yes, of course. But by intuition and chance we diversified ourselves into other segments than cosmetics and perfumery, like spirits and alcohols and now, tobacco.  Spirits and alcohols now account for 35% of our turnover. They only represented 2% of our turnover just two years ago! Premium Beauty News - This partnership between you, Thierry de Baschmakoff and Laurent Caucé, takes the form of two separate entities: Aesthete Lab and MAD. Laurent Caucé - Thierry de Baschmakoff remains at the head of Aesthete Lab and will act as an Artistic Director for MAD. For my part, I will bring my contribution as a strategic advisor for Aesthete Lab. Premium Beauty News - And for MAD, what is precisely its purpose? Laurent Caucé - Being an entity of the Open D group, MAD can rely on an international network to address regionalization issues (Europe, Asia, Middle East, United States). The agency will help clients to define their marketing strategy and product development to the point of sale. It can work as much on high end projects as it can in the mass distribution sector. Premium Beauty News - And Aesthete Lab ? Thierry de Baschmakoff - Aesthete Lab is a creative agency dedicated to brands looking for a privileged creative partnership. It works in a process of artistic direction that can go from a mission for product designing to interior design or communication."
HCP to strengthen North American operations,"HCP Packaging USA, Inc. - a subsidiary of the HCP Packaging group, a leading designer and manufacturer of packaging for the cosmetics, toiletries, skin care and fragrance industries - has announced its intention to open a new factory in Mexico. According to HCP, the manufacturing unit will occupy a 60,000 square foot (18,288 m2) facility located in Reynosa city’s Villa Florida Industrial Park, in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, approximately 15 minutes from the US border. Manufacturing capabilities will include injection moulding, injection blow moulding, UV lacquering, vacuum metalizing, as well as decoration and assembly.  HCP Reynosa is expected to be fully operational during the first quarter of 2010, and will employ approximately 130 people. HCP also announced that John Leitner has been appointed Plant Manager. HCP intends to transfer a portion of its activities from its Hinsdale, New Hampshire and Shanghai, PRC facilities to the new factory. This announcement follows the appointment of Mrs Laura Nowatzki as HCP’s Vice President, West Coast Sales and Marketing. Laura Nowatzki graduated from the University of California, in Santa Barbara, with a BA in mechanical engineering and has previous packaging development and quality control experience at a number of West Coast cosmetics companies, including Smashbox, Guthie Renker, Hain Celestial Personal Care Division and Rock and Republic.

Laura Nowatzki is responsible for managing all sales and marketing activities on new and existing accounts in the area west of the Mississippi River."
Geka Brush to prepare a new technology for 2010,"An expected consolidated turnover of EUR 100 million this year, for a total workforce (including foreign subsidiaries) of 680 people, the German firm, Geka Brush, has truly become in recent years a heavyweight in the beauty industry, in particular in the field of mascara production. It is true that the segment is still expanding with a growth rate, despite the crisis, that will exceed again this year 10%. “But we owe this position”, explains the CEO, Franco Luca,”first to our know-how, our ability to innovate and the industrial organization which was patiently set up over recent years”. A tour at the heart of the historical factory of Bechhofen is enough to convince you. About 80 injection machines running at full speed and approximately 12 automatic lines assembling at impressive rates multiple parts of, may it be, mascara or lip gloss. As for innovation, it can be seen everywhere, along with an injection moulding machine or with an assembly machine. “You know that we were the first to launch the Moltrusion® technology for moulded brushes”, underlines Franco Luca. “We can say with no hesitation that we hold today about 60% of the global market for this type of product. This is not a coincidence.  Our teams have worked hard on this concept. We have just released another innovation in this field with the new brush designed for the new mascara ‘N° 7 of Boots’. This does not mean that we are neglecting the traditional brushes. Because we have not finished yet! Some surprises are coming up in the next few months. People might again be talking about a new technology related to plastic!” As for the German group’s expansion abroad, in recent years, it has not slackened. The high point being, just one year ago, the opening, of the new plant in Elgin, in the United States near Chicago. “A start up at top speed”, explains Franco Luca, “corroborating. our choice to produce locally. We already expect a dozen lines in operation by late 2010”. A positive experience which will surely be followed in the longer term with a similar decision for China,  ""also to supply the local market"". A territorial expansion coupled with a desire to provide an even wider and efficient service. “That’s what motivated our partnership with Ancorotti Cosmetics”, explains Franco Luca.  “An efficient cooperation which already allows us to work together on two launches to come”. “To be and to remain THE leader in our industry by producing the very best, this is one of our key ambitions.” Luxe Pack Monaco will be an opportunity for the company to unveiled the very latest launches of the company. - Push-Up Brush: “Perfectly fascinating”.  Delicate, soft, symmetrical - that pretty much describes the moulded Push-Up Brush and its patented design. Its vertical and horizontal bristle configuration allows for the smooth and extremely precise application of mascara formulation. The tip of the brush gives an extra “push” - it can be used to lift and shape even the tiniest lashes. Indeed, even the lashes on the lower lid and in the corner of the eye can be enhanced beautifully. Another advantage: The new Push-Up Brush can be combined with any of the packaging available in the Geka building block system. - Glamour Touch Brush: “Remarkably confident”.  This mascara brush has got more than just the hang of things. Its spiral-like design makes for great results in terms of eyelash length and curve. And it is also particularly suitable for mascara formulations containing glitter particles, since this applicator brush transports and applies these particles smoothly and evenly. The Glamour Touch Brush is available in both moulded and aluminium versions. And it can be combined with any packaging from the Geka building block system. - Lollipop Sampler: “Surprisingly imaginative”.  Practical, sassy, unique: created by the multi-award-winning designer Dieter Bakic - the Lollipop Sampler is primarily intended for advertising new products at low cost. Its unusual shape makes it a real eye-catcher without any outer packaging. But this product is much more than just an attractive display item: the Lollipop Sampler offers a multitude of options for product personalization. Packed in a one-away disposable blister pack, it makes an ideal give-away. But other areas of application - such as lip gloss - are also possible. The Lollipop Sampler is patented and available exclusively from Geka Brush."
Portola Tech: Bounces back,"This is one of the breaking news of this fall. The Portola Tech company owned by the Portola Group moves up a gear by simply doubling the production areas of its two plants in Czech Republic and China and above all…by starting a brand new factory in the United States to replace the obsolete historical one. Total cost of the operation, 5 million dollars. An industrial entity that made quite a comeback!  In November 2008 the Portola Group, one of the largest producers of closures for beverages (3,000 people, 260 million dollars in turnover, 14 plants), due to financial difficulties, is sold to the U.S. investment fund, Wayzata. The Portola Tech entity (35 million dollars in turnover) specialized in the segment of cosmetics (caps and plastic jars) on the contrary is doing well but is part of the deal.  At this time, the firm had the particularity of producing both thermoset and plastic injected products. “Today, we have every reason to be glad about it,” says Dan Carter, Vice President of Sales. “With the arrival of new investors, we now have the means of our development policy, not only in the United States but also worldwide and especially in Europe”. No sooner said than done.... The new management team decides to simply double the size of the two plants in the Czech Republic and in China, respectively from 3,000 m2 to 6,000 m2 for the first and 5,000 m2 to 10,000m2 for the second, by providing in addition, state-of-the-art injecting equipment. As for the historical American factory, it was moved out and sold and all its equipment was re-installed to be re-used, this month, in a brand new factory of 6,500 m2. An industrial investment strategy coupled with a new product-based approach of the market of cosmetics as the Group has also decided to begin producing makeup boxes and lipstick tubes.  A huge step forward which completes the existing range of closures and jars. “It is, of course, the plant located in Czech Republic, explains Jean-Luc Narcisse, Director of Sales in Europe, that becomes the Group’s European unit par excellence”. Note that the firm now offers in its range of jars and closures an equivalent proportion of standard products and specific products. Targeted turnover of Portola Tech in 2010: 40 million of US dollars."
"«Crisis creates opportunities» Raymond Sinnah, SGD","Premium Beauty News - The current crisis is unprecedented in your business! Raymond Sinnah [1] - Quite true! Can anyone recall a similar period when the market for manufacturers in beauty packaging collapsed from 20 to 40% depending of the segments, in the first half of 2009? ""This is a first"" and we are all impacted by this crisis. And although there are currently some signs of recovery, we have to admit we won’t find a more ""comfortable"" situation before several months. 2009 is obviously a ""special"" year . Our activity has been strongly affected by stock clearance from retail market. Today, we can estimate that this stock clearance is partly finished at this stage of the chain. But this is probably not true on the side of our direct customers, perfumery and cosmetics brands. We will still have to put up with the effects caused by the bursting of this ""bubble of overstocking"" that occurred during the 2007/2008 period. You must remember that while we were bearing the brunt of this historical drop, the consumer market only decreased by 5% in volume in France. Given this situation, we are obviously forced to deal with it very carefully. Premium Beauty News - How much leeway do you have in this case? Raymond Sinnah - It is obviously small. You must remember that we are in a heavy industry with huge continuous industrial tools, furnaces that do not stop or restart just like that. Like most of the industry players, we have ""shelved"" some of the production tool. We have also anticipated the rebuilding of a furnace. SGD has taken advantage of the low activity to speed up several projects in the areas of cleanliness, quality, productivity and innovation in order to better prepare economic recovery. We are on segments of ""specialties"" requiring both to be faultless in terms of quality and to be also competitive. SGD continues its strategy of differentiation through innovation, and you’ll discover in a few days at Luxe Pack Monaco [2], one of the fruits of this innovative approach, especially in terms of environment, around our ""Verre Infini"" (Infinite ’Glass), with the help of several other manufacturers in the packaging industry. Premium Beauty News - Fortunately, your business is not impacted the same way in other parts of the world where you are industrially operating! Raymond Sinnah - Absolutely, China and Brazil are in that case. They are great growth engines for SGD. The end market over there experiences trends of + 5 to 10% per year. We have recently invested in Brazil in a complete unit dedicated to decoration (silk-screening, lacquering and glass etching) to enhance our offer. Brazil was the only glass factory owned by SGD that was not equipped with a decoration unit. Premium Beauty News - Evolving laws continue to weigh on the packaging sector. Don’t you think? Raymond Sinnah - As far as glass is concerned, even though you always need to remain updated with changes, everyone agrees that it is a material known for its qualities, its harmlessness and its stability. This is not the case for other materials. Concerning REACH, the glass material is exempt."
Weckerle opens a conditioning unit in China,"The German company Weckerle Cosmetics has opened this month a filling unit for cosmetic products in China, 200 km from Shanghai. A new milestone for Thomas Weckerle, CEO, and his team after the takeover last year of the manufacturer Dr. Scheller Cosmetics AG, which had already helped Weckerle Cosmetics become one of the leading companies in Europe for full service. “The Chinese unit is dedicated to the Chinese domestic market,” says Thomas Weckerle. The catalogue of products and services displayed by the firm is particularly abundant with of course the full range of lipsticks (including the famous sticks with dual-components or Weckerle’s double injection exclusive technique), and also pencils, lip glosses, eye shadows, foundations, pressed powders, mascaras, nail polishes etc., and of course, all the possibilities associated with packaging. Note the new technique known as “multimoulding” proposed by Weckerle Cosmetics thanks to a new machine developed by engineers from the firm. Geographically, the German group is now operating in many parts of the world, either industrially or commercially: starting with Germany of course, but also France near Fontainebleau (where a new automatic gloss and mascara filling machine has just been installed), without forgetting the United States, Brazil and now China. The current popularity of these products will lead very shortly, to the entry of organic cosmetics in Weckerle’s catalogue."
Cartografica Pusterla buys Cartonnages Cazelles ,"The Italian company Cartografica Pusterla whose historical factory (100 million folding cases per year) and headquarters are located inVenegono Inferiore,near Milan, has just taken over the French manufacturer of assembled cases, Cartonnages Cazelles, located in Cherré near Le Mans ( EUR 9 million in turnover, 55 staff). Thanks to this acquisition, the Italian group headed by Mr. Giuseppe Meana sees its consolidated turnover jump to 36 million euros for a total of 240 staff. Cartografica Pusterla consolidates its position in France where it already owned the company Coffrets Créations specialized in the production of covered cases, whose plant in Oradour-sur-Glane offers an annual production capacity of over 5 million cases of the automatic and semi-automatic type, as well as their possible packaging. “What is interesting, says Giuseppe Meana, is the perfect synergy between the two companies regarding their clients. In addition Cazelles also has a good mastery of thermoforming. Take two medium-sized companies, the meeting of the two makes a solid entity.” The Cartografica Pusterla group also operates in Romania with the company Dacica Teca established in 2004, to meet growing demand for hand-made cases. “The assembly workshop in Bucharest offers a reduction of risks and time linked with the development of the products. Our organization has no intermediates and the whole phase dedicated to product study and development is provided by our technical and commercial teams, French or Italian,” Giuseppe Meana adds. However, in order to guarantee the highest quality standards, the production phases requiring high technological content (offset printing, hot stamping, embossing) are still performed at Cartografica Pusterla.  “The capacity to achieve the pilot lot production at Coffrets Création reduces or eliminates, for our clients, the need for long and expensive trips”. The other assset ographic proximity: Bucharest is only 2 / 3 hours flight from Milan or Paris and 4 / 7 days of road transport""."
New business model for HCT,"“It has taken us three years to implement our new business model”, announces James Thorpe, Managing director of HCT Europe and HCT Asia. Originally, HCT’s activity was mainly focused on designing innovative packaging for the cosmetic industry and subcontracting manufacturing services to high quality partnering factories in Asia.  Today, the group runs its two factories dedicated to plastic injection, and a metal processing and electroplating plant, in addition to a filling factory. The group now has a workforce of more than 1,000 Asia based staff as well as several Sales and Innovation Centres across the globe. HCT is poised to sign a final agreement for acquiring a manufacturing unit producing brushes and applicators.  The new factory will help the group to complement their existing capabilities and then to offer their customers high quality multidimensional solutions, from start to finish. “We feel that diversifying our business in these associated areas will allow us to offer our customers valuable savings in time and cost.  Considering current uncertain economic times, such an offer will certainly be welcomed,” says James Thorpe. “Our aim is to increase our turnover by 20% in the next three years,” he adds. “There aren’t a million ways to achieve our goal”, explains Romayne Apcar for HCT France, “one must both innovate and deliver impeccable quality.  There is a rich vein of creativity that runs throughout HCT, the spirit of innovation is a major part of the group’s DNA. We protect our innovation by patenting the concepts we create. We have also recently commissioned a make up artist specialised in European celebrities to work with our innovation and formulation teams to help us pinpoint emerging trends with both the formulation and application side of our business.” A couple of examples of recent launches are: Dior Capture Totale Flash Défatiguant Regard, and the Urban Decay Pocket Rocket Lipgloss. “Our next challenge will be a mascara innovation concept,” announces Romayne Apcar."
Action group launches boycott campaign against Ahava Cosmetics,"The so-called Stolen Beauty campaign was launched on the occasion of the Cosmoprof North America annual tradeshow, which was held from July 19 to 21 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Yesterday, bikini-clad Code Pink activists rallied with signs and chants at the Ahava booth inside the beauty industry’s event and call on the Israeli company to end what they denounced as “its exploitations of the occupied West Bank”.  Code Pink says that Ahava’s products, which are produced in a manufacturing facility located in the West Bank, are misleadingly labelled as “Made in Israel”. Indeed, Ahava has situated its main manufacturing plant and showroom and employs 120 staff at the Israeli settlement Mitzpe Shalem in the Palestinian West Bank near the shores of the Dead Sea. Code Pink] says Ahava “is involved in and profit from the occupation of the Palestinian West Bank”.  In the past two months, the action group has already staged three demonstrations against Ahava in Israel and New York. Through the boycott campaign, Code Pink] wants to pressure Ahava to end its practices as well as to pressure the Israeli government to end “violations of international law against Palestine and its people”. Code Pink also plans to educate consumers about Ahava."
"Alain Chevassus, Cosfibel: ""proximity and creativeness to deal with the crisis""","According to Alain Chevassus, CEO of Cosfibel group, ""Crisis has really settled in! Sales have dropped - 10% in the best cases - 20% in the worst ...! We are taking the blow like everyone. It is time to save up"" Consequences: cost reduction at every level of the Group ""Cosfibel will not be attending Luxe Pack in Monaco, indicates Alain Chevassus, even though this was a difficult decision to make because this show remains a must"". But Alain Chevassus wants to remain optimistic. ""Crisis will have helped setting the record straight"". He believes that crisis has changed consumers, as well as the whole industry that depends on it, calling for ""primacy of local service and creativeness"". Alain Chevassus also considers that the industrial world is starting to split into two main categories of actors: ""on one side big manufacturers capable of producing large quantities and on the other side, the multiplicity of other manufacturers, we also belong to, flexible, fast, creative and multifunctional"" And to seduce new consumers you must adapt yourself. ""Promoting events will make the difference, underlines Alain Chevassus. We must be able to answer local demand..."" Hence a network oriented strategy for creativeness, manufacturing and commercial proximity. Urban network®. Client minded, the group is weaving an urban network, in other words, it is moving closer to its clients in urban areas, to answer their needs in terms of product presentation and promotion in their outlets. Via this network, Cosfibel provides comprehensive services: from contacts and order taking to distribution through design, technology and logistics. All necessary steps related to prior ranking by major groups and their headquarters, but also by independent clients careful about safeguarding their identity. ""This working model answers two challenges, explains Alain Chevassus. With the emergence of large metropolitan areas that generate new centres for decision making, it is necessary to support local services, to meet orders at this level. So, Cosfibel’s organization enables to help a local client when the need is local and an international client when necessary. In addition, being close to clients saves time! The ability for responsiveness and flexibility are some of  the main assets of Cosfibel"". In this context, is service also synonymous with Full Service? ""Yes, undoubtedly,"" underlines Alain Chevassus. ""Today we can also offer Full Service thanks to the partnerships we have and to the ones we are implementing"". Since 2000, year when the group was created, network is growing: Brussels, Paris, Barcelona, Madrid, Düsseldorf but also Sao Paulo, New York, Shanghai and Hong Kong. In 2008, Cosfibel has also settled in London and Moscow. Today Cosfibel operates in 11 major cities and the group plans to be present in 50 cities within five to ten years."
Autajon to inaugurate two new plants at the beginning of next fall,"The Autajon group who just completed the takeover of the Belgian company Bopack [1], specialized in the manufacturing of adhesive labels, a third of the production supplying the perfume and cosmetic sector, is on the brink of inaugurating, in October, in the United States, a new factory that will produce folding boxes for perfumes and cosmetics. The new site will offer a13 000 sqm area against currently 7 000 sqm. A second event is scheduled early fall in Germany with the inauguration of the new factory in Landerer subsequently increasing the manufacturing area from17 000 sqm to 24 000 sqm. Total investment, according to the group, ""between 24 and 30 million Euros"". Today Autajon has a turnover of 370 million Euros, employs 2,800 staff and has 22 production sites around the world. The success of this French company based near Montélimar is undoubtedly a model to be followed. Perfumery-cosmetics, pharmacy, wines and spirits, confectionery, chocolate, tea, coffee ...  The Autajon Group covers today nearly every segment of the label and cardboard packaging sector. But perfumery-cosmetics still remains the first market of the company representing almost 40% of its turnover followed by pharmaceuticals (20%). External growth, spearhead of the French firm since 1995, has helped the group become one of the European leaders for converting folding boxes. ""Our aim is to become leaders in each specialty"" explains Gilles Poncato, Sales Director of the group. ""One can say our objective is well advanced in Europe in the segment of folding boxes designed in particular for the Beauty & Health sector. And we are almost there with labelling. The takeover of Bopack is of course  a fantastic opportunity to help us achieve this goal. Bopack is a great specialist in adhesive labelling in Europe, if not the specialist with excellent knowledge in digital printing, not to mention the fact that the group is well positioned in the manufacturing of cylindrical covers or sleeves"". Another line of investment in recent months for the Autajon group: environment, with the implementation of carbon footprint calculation for the Montélimar plant to be carried out afterwards on several other plants of the group."
Yves Rocher wants to expand its retail network in Canada,"French cosmetics maker and retailer, Yves Rocher, announced yesterday its intention to extend its presence in Canada through store franchises. This follows the announcement made a little more than a month ago that the company was introducing in Canada its new brand image, logo and store concept called the Atelier of Botanical Beauty. So far, aside from a few tests in the early 1980’s all of Yves Rocher stores in Canada have been corporate. However, in the 80 countries Yves Rocher is present, roughly 75% of its stores are either franchises or run by agents. In France, it is one of the most popular cosmetics franchises with 550 stores. “Because the brand was not as well known in Canada, we wanted to grow it ourselves first and ensure the success of our stores before providing Canadians with the chance to purchase a franchise,” said Stephane Duval, Director, Stores, North America.  Duval came to Canada a year and a half ago from Italy where he also implemented the franchise strategy. Yves Rocher has been in Canada since the mid-eighties and Canadians can purchase its products via catalogue and the Internet across the country and through stores in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick. The company aims to cover the entire territory and to expand its stores from Newfoundland to British Columbia. All franchises will be in the new Atelier of Botanical Beauty concept, which has an objective of generating 15% more in sales versus the previous Yves Rocher stores. In France, where the Atelier has been implemented in several test stores since the end of 2008, it is generating an average +20% increase, and in Canada, the first Atelier, which opened at the Montreal Eaton Centre at the end of May, is maintaining a +35% increase in sales versus last year."
Heinz Glas: series of good news,"Heinz Glas whose work with several major brands has often been awarded, in particular during the 2008 DuftStars (the German FiFi Awards), has recently seen the work achieved throughout development and production of the last Lacoste line, publicly honored by his client, Procter & Gamble. A even more prestigious award when you know that the German glassmaker not only produced the bottle but also mastered the whole project. As good news never comes alone, the glassmaker confides that many orders placed by clients for big upcoming launches should settle the group as one of the leaders among high-end global glassmakers. The German glassmaker is confident that end of 2009 and beginning of 2010 will just be ""amazing"". It took more than ten years to get there. Karl August Heinz, boss and owner can be proud of what was achieved. As can be Dr Ulrich Nebe, CEO of the group who has also worked hard to place the industrial tool to the highest level. He will, undoubtedly remain as one of the major actors in the industrial growth of Heinz Glas in the last decade. “Of course we are suffering like everyone else but we are holding on and we will hold on!”  For Thomas Kneitz, Heinz Glas International’s newly appointed General Sales Director. “Crisis is hitting hard, very hard , but the Heinz group is resisting quite well, maybe better than some of our colleagues.”  There are many reasons for this competitive advantage. But the main one is all the industrial innovations carried out in recent years that rendered the glass factory more flexible and competitive. “Focusing on organization and innovation also pays off every day. We have become a reliable glassmaker who always meets its commitments and proves every day that innovation and mastery are part of our culture.”  And as he underlines, “Our triple positioning in perfumes, mass-market/medium range/high-end also helps.” Main industrial investment in 2009: the complete renovation of the 120 ton oven at Pisau’s glass factory. ""The timing for this renovation was appropriate,"" explains Thomas Kneitz, ""because of decline in demand. This will give us a chance to restart precisely along with the first tremors of the recovery"". But when will the market start turning around again? That’s a very good question. ""Very difficult to say"", admits Rudolph Wurm, Perfumes Sales Director. Nonetheless the German glassmaker is all set with a strike force of 9 ovens: four of them in Germany, two of them in Poland, two of them in Peru and one in China, and with a production capacity of 468 tons of glass per day. Of course, because of the crisis, the managers had to temporarily stop the brand new oven of 50 tons inaugurated in 2007in Kleintettau, But it means even more available output when the day comes ...! Industrial efforts have been constant since 2003, with investments ranging between 24 million and 36 million Euros annually. The peak was reached in 2007 with a figure of nearly 37 million. Investments both in ovens, bottle producing machines but also and especially in workshops dedicated to finishing. “This is where we have really changed our approach,” explains Thomas Kneitz.  “We had to become highly efficient in all finishing techniques. And I mean all of them. This forced us to invest massively in state-of-the-art lines for metallization and finishing but also automated lines for pad printing. We are capable of doing everything or almost, from glass etching to metallization, lacquering, pad-printing, pasting, labelling, hot stamping, and even laser etching. And our customers keep asking!”  The upcoming launches will be indicative of this trend. Eventually, a very important element in the scientific device to control products manufacturing, a brand new testing laboratory established in Kleintettau last year with four full-time employees. Another strong asset on which, these last years, managers at Heinz Glas’ have relied on, internationalization. After Poland, China, came Peru. The latest ""master stroke"" to date, because the potential of development in South America, Brazil as a leader, is confirmed every day. Of course admit managers at Heinz Glas’, “it is not always easy to manage a technical team several thousand kilometers away, but with perseverance, we get by!”. As for China (1000 employees out of Heinz group’s 3000 employees!), the upgrading is almost completed."
Natta moves on in the cosmetic sector,"The French company based at Berd’huis in Normandy which, so far, subcontracted for several companies specialised in plastic processing, is doing more and more business with the major operators in the perfume and cosmetic industry.

Li & Fung Group creates LF Beauty,"Two years after having entered the perfumery and cosmetic business in addition to its previous activities (textile, personal care, mass market products),Li & Fung is announcing its intention to become a key player in this industry. In 2007, Li & Fung firstly bought CGroup HK Ltd (June 2007, secondary packaging, full service, promotional items), PB Beauty, UK (August 2007, private labelling of cosmetic producs), then Imagine PoS (January 2008, point-of-sale advertising) and RT Sourcing (August 2008, primary packaging). This strategy of know-how development through external growth will now be concentrated in a single entity, as Li & Fung’s cosmetic business will be gathered under the name LF Beauty by July 2009.  Thus, two years proved to be enough for Li & Fung to clarify its strategy, organise its know-how and become a global supplier on the entire supply chain of the industry. In practice, LF Beauty now features sales staff in Europe (Paris, London), in the USA (New York, Dallas), and in China (Hong Kong, Shanghai), an important R&D laboratory in the UK, including a product development and sourcing teams, project management and quality insurance teams for its various production facilities (Hong-Kong, ShenZen, DongGuan, Shanghai, etc…), filling units (Angleterre, Chine).  Organised in networks, LF Beauty teams manage thousands suppliers, industrial partners, from the product’s design to its production (where materials and components are sourced from various suppliers) and delivery. LF Beauty will develop a customer-centred model.  From the primary container to PoS advertising, and “full service” activities, promotional items and assembling activities, LF Beauty operates by combining know-how and customer oriented project management. Now, Li & Fung’s new entity is carrying on its market covering strategy, and specialising its various units on each segment (a luxury division, a mass-market division, a direct sales division, etc. ...). Furthermore, LF Beauty benefits from Li & Fung international network, as the group operates in  forty countries worldwide: a strong asset while the sourcing sector is constantly evolving. Questioned about the specificity of LF Beauty, Guy d’Auriol and Yan d’Auriol, former founders of the CG Group HK Ltd, and current heads LF Beauty, say:  “LF Beauty is a valuable partner for world’s leaders in the beauty industry, from creativity, to industrial development, quality insurance and logistic.  Thanks to our constant presence on the field and the various control procedures that we have implemented, we can guarantee a top compliance level to our customers.  Furthermore, belonging to a group such as Li & Fung provides us with the resources we need to serve our ambitions and those of our customers.” Bruce Rockowitz, President of L&F Trading adds: “the beauty business is the most recent in our group, but we are expecting a strong growth in this sector that we are ready to support through new purchases, with the aim to become a key player”."
OEKAbeauty’s activity grew by 15 % since de beginning of the year,"When many packaging suppliers on the cosmetic and perfumery segment currently show drops in turnover, sometimes close to -20 %, or even -30 %, OEKAMETALL’s activity is growing by 15% compared to the same period last year.  This result has nothing to do with chance, explains Gerald Oehlhorn, who head the German company specialised in the production of mascaras, lipgloss and lipstick tubes. OEKAMETALL’s assets holds in five points: speed in decision making, flexibility, automation, complete industrial offer and constantly improved productivity to offer the best product at the best price. Another item could be added to this list, the importance of innovative offers. By the way, one must not say OEKAMETALL anymore but OEKAbeauty for the cosmetic activity and OEKAtech for the “technical parts” business. “Luckily enough we are doing well in the cosmetic market”, admits Gerald Oehlhorn, “because our activity in the automotive sector, for the same period, has dropped by 30 %!”  Actually, this sector still accounts for 1/3 of the company’s activity. As far as OEKABeauty is concerned, it seems obvious that the German company is reaping the benefits of an industrial strategy carefully planned during the last ten years.  “When a number of our colleagues chose to offshore part of their production, in Asia, we opted on the contrary, for full automation of our production workshops and integrating as much as possible the manufacturing sequences (injection, finishes, metallisation, fitting…, not to mention manufacturing of brushes for mascaras),” explains Gerald Oelhorn. “We have also worked hard on improving our productivity at every level of production by suppressing downtime and resumption, as much as possible, in optimising our stocks and reducing or even suppressing production scraps,” he adds. The outcome is that in the injection and air-blown injection workshop, the German company has improved the number of ""good"" parts by 20% in just one year! “Of course the pressure on prices is constant, but these gains in points of productivity allow us to sustain the challenge”, confirms Gerald Oehlhorn. Another asset is the company’s policy for training and integrating the young people. “Each year, we integrate from five to ten young people to attend technical and/or commercial apprenticeship. For seven years now, we have been training young engineers in cooperation with the Heidenheim University (cooperative education) This is greate to create competitiveness in workshops and offices. This also gives us a chance to built up a very solid skills base,” says Gerald Oehlhorn. Even at a run, visiting the Bamberg plant, is very informative. And one understands quickly why the company is performing better today. The plastic injection workshop has 42 machines, a number of them coming from the latest generation in electric presses (annual capacity, 300 millions parts), the whole of it very automated. The workshop assembling the different parts used for the production of mascaras, lipgloss and lipstick tubes is organised by autonomous islets where each line of product is assembled and decorated at once (capacity of 120 Mio pcs). Again, very few employees. The lacquering and metalizing workshop has doubled with the adjunction of a brand new and completely automated unit (12 employees) a hundred kilometres far from Bamberg, CCO, capable of processing large orders (this unit also manufactures the flocks for lipgloss). Finally managers from OEKAMETALL display with some pride the different standards passed successfully like the ISO 9001, the ISO TS 16949 (automotive industry), the ISO 14001 (protection of the environment) and the BS OHSAS 18001 (labour safety). Concerning the new products issued from the Bamberg factory, there are a number of them, with as a high point the industrialisation of the famous vibrating mascara for Lancôme with a production rate that does not seem to want to slow down, on the contrary. Not to mention the latest lipgloss “Laque Fever” for Lancôme, the mascara “Volume Collagène” for L’Oréal Paris, the two mascaras “Extreme Resist” and the lipstick for Nivea, the lipgloss “Stay Glossy” for Rimmel, the mascara “Volume Diva” for Astor or the lipsticks and gloss “Wild Rose” for Lumene."
Airless dispensers: not concerned by the crisis,"Main objective of AirlessPack Association in 2009: carrying out a number of actions in order to promote and communicate throughout Europe on a system that offers multiple advantages in terms of packaging, delivery and preservation of products, whether cosmetic, pharmaceutical or even alimentary. Of course the aim for member companies is to help developping the global market related to this type of products. First stage, elaboration of a press kit and sensitizing of main European media, whether professional or mass audience, written or broadcasted, on the benefits of using airless dispensers. Several dozens of journalists have received or will receive a complete kit describing the Association and its goals. Appointments have been (and are) made with members of the Association to help journalists improve their knowledge in this unique system in terms of packaging and delivering products. Main objective, publication of articles and/or inquiries about airless systems. Second stage, joint implementation of a website dedicated toAirlessPack Association to help professionals as well as mass audience, find details regarding the Association and its goals as well as information on the system itself and its advantages. Third stage, sensitize all actors both, at the level of payers and at the level of prescribers (for instance Mass Distribution) so that airless dispensers are used more massively. The organisation of an European round-table is already scheduled for the second half of 2009. Fourth stage, lay foundations for a genuine ""airless label"" the implementation of which would begin early 2010, perfect highpoint and a guarantee of quality and recognition granted to this type of system. Obviously, it is fundamental that what was first initiated by four manufacturers of the sector is relayed and amplified by all the other actors involved in the business, because as the old saying goes... ""United we stand, divided we fall"" One will also note that since the beginning of 2009, Airless dispensers are not concerned by the crisis! A clear sign that this type of packaging suits exactly current needs in terms of preservation of the content and hygiene."
"“The enamel market is a mass market,” Pierre Miasnik (Fiabila)","Premium Beauty News - In a dull market, nail enamels are doing fine! How do you explain this? Pierre Miasnik - Enamels can be found in the same stores consumers do their everyday shopping. The colour offer is significantly substantial: from light shades, French manicures to the deepest reds while enriching the palette to blue, green and yellow colours. Women know that a light enamel will help nails look more attractive, will hide the streaks and will prevent nails from splitting. It is all but expensive luxury. Premium Beauty News - What is your perception of the main trends in the global market of nail polish? Pierre Miasnik - It a mass market involving large volumes. We have noticed significant improvement in qualities both technical and cosmetic. Recent regulations have banished the use of toluene and DBP (Dibutylphthalate) and we have also discarded from our lists several ingredients often used in polishes. Customers are looking for easy-to-use products. Easy in the sense that they are easy to apply, that they cover without streaks, that they are bright and remain bright, that they dry quickly and are resistant. To make up for the withdrawal of some ingredients and meet new requirements we have rethought the formulation of enamels. Premium Beauty News - Do these changes impact your production tool? And if it is the case, what investments do you need to implement? For many years, Fiabila’s activity has been progressing strongly, and our foreign affiliates, put aside, we are improving our production tools and filling tools to step up production capacity, quality product and safety. This year, we just finished installing last generation sprinklers for a cost of more than 2 million Euros and we are currently placing the whole site of Maintenon under telesurveillance. Still in 2009, we have installed high tech-equipment for the production of clay gels. This allows us to manufacture brighter and more fluid enamels therefore easier to apply, more stable, and with better constancy from one lot to the other. Premium Beauty News – Regulations regarding environment are increasing every day. What’s the impact on your activity and how to you coop with it? Pierre Miasnik - We are currently studying the installation of a storage unit for solvents and implementation of solutions to limit open tank production."
USA/Europe: Texen’s ambitions,"Premium Beauty News – What were the reasons for the buyout of Mar-Lee? Christian Baravaglio – We were interested in this company’s expertise in the injection of highly technical plastic parts and of its mastery for instance in, in- mould labelling as well as design of the moulds themselves. Of course, it was also the occasion for Texen, one of the worldwide leaders specialised in plastic packaging for the Beauty industry, to gain a foothold-in the United States, thus getting closer to our major clients (Estée Lauder, Chanel, Avon et L’Oréal). Premium Beauty News – What are your goals? Christian Baravaglio – In fact, we are going to take advantage of Mar-Lee’s expertise to establish Texen’s own expertise in the Luxury universe. Incidentally as an illustration, people will witness the launch in the coming days of several packaging for the Luxury market. At the same time, Texen intends to develop in Europe Mar-Lee’s expertise in the pharmaceutical and medical field , particularly in terms of cleanroom manufacturing. Premium Beauty News - All these actions have a price? Christian Baravaglio – Yes indeed, upgrading Mar-lee in the Luxury industry will cost around USD 5 millions. But we are extremely confident regarding results since the company’s turnover in 2009 should rise. We are expecting strong growth in 2010 (+ 20 %) and 2011. Premium Beauty News – What makes Texen such a winner? Christian Baravaglio – Many things in fact! But surely rigor is one of our main assets. Each study is a commitment for us ! It is backed with product and process conception, timelines and detailed costing. We offer complete and immediate operational response. Resulting from investor’s industrial knowledge, focused on the trilogy: cost / quality / delays, this rigor is present at each stage of the project. It also profits from constantly increased production capacities. Texen is one of the first companies to have equipped itself with 6 axis-robots, and we have been investing for years, from 8 % to 12 % of our turnover in industrial equipment. Our flexible, fully robotised lines operate under systematic Zero default check-out points."
"« Innovation as a main component », Thomas Jonas, MWV","Premium Beauty News – What were your feelings concerning the sector when you arrived a few months ago? Thomas Jonas –  Contrarily to what you might have thought, the sector was in a good shape. Concerning the pump activity in 2008, it is true we had to deal with tensions regarding price increases in plastic raw materials, but finally the end market reacted well. As you also know we had the opportunity to acquire the company of Dutch origin, Keltec, specialized in the manufacturing of airless systems. The extremely clever patents developed by Keltec strengthens our leadership versus prestigious partners in the healthcare industry. Not to mention very promising developments in the perfume pumps like the Clikit IP a resin injected version of our Melodie Clikit pump.  Clikit IP was created to give high-end perfume brands a high performance pump, offering new possibilities for decoration of dressing parts. We are also capable of offering a level of decoration that did not exist on the market before.
Our goal is to help our customers win on their markets thanks to this kind of differentiation. Premium Beauty News -  But you have also inherited of the cardboard transformation activity … Thomas Jonas –  That is true! A sector where we have started important restructuration keeping our production tool in one plant in the United states but maintaining and reinforcing our factories in Central Europe, Brazil and China. It is a sector of activity in which we believe even if it encounters the same economic difficulties as the others presently. But due to the fact we are established, in high growth countries like the ones in Central Europe, we can only be confident in our potential for the sector. Premium Beauty News -  Speaking of high growth countries, MWV is also established in Asia. Thomas Jonas – Yes, thanks to a factory located near Shanghai where we are centralizing pump manufacturing and cardboard transformation. There also, we are very ambitious. Which does not mean we are favoring a area of the world and not another one: we wish to be where our customers are wherever they are, in order to accompany them in their growth. And even if the United States and Europe suffer more today in comparison with other parts of the world, we are not in the state of mind consisting in making a strategic choice of a geographic area versus another. We will strive the same way from one side of the planet to the other. Premium Beauty News – We cannot avoid a question on environment. Thomas Jonas – Absolutely! We feel strongly about environment here at MWV and we are proud to have been ranked, three years in a row by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, first company in the Containers & Packaging Groups category. Environment is a strategic axe of our industrial policy but also of our policy in terms of innovation. No doubt, the coming months will bring quite a few good surprises regarding this last subject."
"“Business recovery is slower than expected,” Didier Bourgine, Augros Cosmetic Packaging","Premium Beauty News - Times are tough for companies in the plastic industry.  What about Augros Cosmetic Packaging? Didier Bourgine - Augros’ plastic business has relatively dynamic during the first semester thanks to the launch of new products. On the other hand, the finishing business has been decreasing steadily at our of MSV decor branch.  We initially thought that the market would quickly recover, with a rise of the business activity by the end of the summer. Apparently, this optimistic scenario is not the one occurring and the recovery of the economy will be longer than expected.  The slowdown of retail sales and the postponing of new launches are now following initial stock clearance measures decided by our customers. Premium Beauty News - Considering the wide range of products that you are supplying to the beauty industry, what are the most dynamic segments? Didier Bourgine - The slower rhythm of new launches boosted our more classical ranges, in particular those that contribute to brands’ signatures. On the contrary, ranges that already had difficulties to meet success are strongly decreasing, whether they are new or not. Furthermore, retailers seem to be more cautious than before about new products, which may explain why several launches have been postponed and why their number is declining. Premium Beauty News - Augros Cosmetic Packaging focuses its activities on two areas, plastic packaging components and decoration.  Are they efficient synergies between these activities? Didier Bourgine - Actually there are good complementarities between plastic packaging and surface treatment as the perfumery industry is increasingly requesting high performing decoration technologies such as vacuum metallization, or lacquering.  Furthermore, as our two production sites are located in a close area (less than 45 minutes from one to the other), production flows can be organised within short delays. Premium Beauty News - Perfume and cosmetic brands are increasingly looking for full-services. Didier Bourgine - We are receiving more and more requests for full-services and we address them positively when there are opportunities. For Thierry Mugler’s Angel skincare line, for instance, we are supplying not only the glass jars, but also the labels, and the decoration on glass and plastic surfaces. Premium Beauty News - How do you address environmental issues? Didier Bourgine - Our mission is to answer to the needs of our customers and some brands are strongly committed on environmental issues.  The implementation of the REACH legislation is accelerating the shift towards eco-friendliness.  We strictly comply with it, whether for or plastic packaging branch or our decoration business."

Cosfibel: New platforms in Indonesia and Tunisia,"“We are becoming global partners for our customers, who chose to work with us for our development capabilities (4 R&D offices), the quality of our contract manufacturers worldwide, our experience in the management of trans-borders projects and for the platform concept that we are developing at a larger scale,” explains Stanislas Péronnet, Cosfibel’s Operations Director. La latest platform of the series was launched in Indonesia and is specialising in primary packaging and luxury cases. In order to strengthen and develop supply sources that are closer from the European market, Cosfibel is also settling a new platform in Tunisia. “As far as sourcing is concerned, we remain highly active with regard to our main markets, promotional and packaging, with the aim to increase synergies and competitiveness,” Stanislas Péronnet adds. “We have developed a wide industrial know-how, in our own manufacturing units, which has been strengthened during the last years in the fields of metal and the making of luxury boxes.” “Creativity, flexibility, reactivity and competitive prices…”, Cosfibel’s arguments may be well received by customer companies in a period where they precisely try to optimise the cost and reliability of the supply chain. Cosfibel is also claiming its willingness to design and market a larger number of environment-friendly products and to evaluate the group’s carbon emissions by 2009.  Furthermore, the company has been performing routine inspections of its supplier’s social practices, since 2007."
"Love & desire, latest trends by Intercos","The event gathered about 350 persons from 130 companies, including the most prestigious cosmetics companies in world, eager to discover the latest collections proposed by Intercos’ staff.  Several marketing departments consider this event as unavoidable. Into the showroom, Dario Ferrari, the group’s president, together with its team, presented 114 new coloured formulations (Intercos), as well as 68 new make-up pens formulations (interfila) and 40 new skincare formulations. The collections were presented under the theme Love & Desire:  “Relevancy and emotional links between products and consumers are key factors of success of a marketing strategy. Today’s consumers ask so much to a brand, much more than ever…  because they have seen everything already!”Dario Ferrari explains. Intercos’ research and development department strictly complied with these recommendations: – Excess-ion, is a range inspired by gold and designed for those that are attracted by an excessive and guilt-free consumption
– I Love Cosmetics, is a range built on the “I need it” concept. The love and desire for items that cannot be missed, that are “emotional necessities”
– Revolution, is a surprising range, where the sounds of rock impose a rapid and furious rhythm: “I’m free to be who I want and when I want”
– Sea beauty … where its about discovering love in a sub aquatic blue and crystalline and sensual world, …
– Cabaret, an elegant and sexy range, teasing one’s sensuality
– Charmed Life, a range for creating one’s own fairytale, for making romances and dreams come true. Intercos’ new success in the field of innovation is very good news when the economy is slowing down worldwide.  “Of course, we need to be careful but, once again, our teams have demonstrated they know how in the anticipation of trends and the design of new products.  As far as we are concerned, we remain confident on the possibility to achieve our financial targets, that is to say a 10% increase of our turnover compared to last year, despite the fact that the first months of the year were really tough,” Dario Ferrari says. Intercos’ confidence in the future is certainly reinforced by the growing demand for “full service” product design and contract manufacturing.  “In this area, our experience is a source of reliability for our customers,” explains Dario Ferrari."
Ancorotti Cosmetics takes off like a shot,"The brand new company created by Renato Ancorotti and daughter Enrica, both of them fond of fashion and make-up arts, apparently launched its first collection successfully. All along the four days of the Cosmoprof show in Bologna (Italy), the stand of the company specialising in the design of mascaras, eye-lines and other products for the eyes was fully booked.  Demand remains strong on this dynamic segment.  Apparently, the creative work made by Enrica Ancorotti has been fruitful, which is particularly noticeable considering the record time in which the products were developed. Ancorotti’s brand new manufacturing unit is settled in Crema (Italy) in a 3,000 square metre facility.  The building is features cleanrooms and a state-of-the-art laboratory.  As far as research and development are concerned,Ancorotti Cosmetics also works in close cooperation with the University of Milan. The Cosmoprof tradeshow was the first occasion for the young company to present its range make-up products inspired by the 1930s, 1960s and 1990s and featuring interesting visual innovations. Ancorotti’s staff, including Marie Guilbert, the head of their sales department in France, will present its new collection in September 2009 in Paris, in dedicate showroom."
Maesa promotes creativity in full-service contract manufacturing,"Premium Beauty News - What does “full-service” mean at Maesa? Sophie Thiolas - We manufacture f turn-key lines of tailor-made cosmetic and perfumery products for our customers, as well as packaging and promotional items. We provide a full service as we conceive our customers’ cosmetics ranges from A to Z: from the market study, to the conception, to selection of relevant packaging options, and tailor-made and the design of entirely customized formulations, to the production, quality control and delivery.  Actually, Maesa takes care of every step. Our customers - retailers and brand owners - need to focus on their main business: marketing and distribution.  We offer them efficient product lines, so as they do not need to take care of the vagaries of design, product development and manufacture. Premium Beauty News - What is the scope of your know-how? Sophie Thiolas - Actually, once we’re working on a project, we usually dedicate a full-time team to it with the aim cover all the aspects. The following persons may be involved: a sales manager, an innovation task force headed by Maesa’s Creative Director, a brand manager, a designer, a regulatory affairs manager and a logistics manager. Our customers therefore benefit from the creativity and the quality of a dedicated team but do not have to support related fixed costs; That’s exactly what we mean about “full-service”.  We can also extend our vision to the retail environment and develop the merchandising, the POS advertising and promotional samples. In practice, we adapt our service to the specific needs and goals of each customer.  For instance, we cooperate with a network of selected suppliers worldwide in order to identify those matching with each project.  As a result, a product may be made of various components sourced from manufacturing facilities in Europe, the USA or Asia.  Each year, we develop more than 3,000 new products for our customers. Premium Beauty News - Can you name some of your latest successful developments? Sophie Thiolas - There are plenty! Concerning the most recent ones, let’s mention the System U sun-care range featuring 18 SKUs and covering all the segments of the market for offering a tailor-made protection to the entire family.  Let’s also mention the Carrefour’s bath and body-care line, under the “Rites Originels” brand, featuring 14 SKUs covering the entire body and hair care segments. Eventually, I’d like to highlight the products we developed for Pimkie, in particular the Lili Vanilla, Sexy Pink and Love Purple toilet waters.  Maesa has entirely refreshed the line, through the development of new design for the closures, mixing retro chic and pure lines, and the definition of new packaging colours and graphics, but keeping the vials unchanged.  We also developed Pimkie’s Love Sun Shine and Love Island toilet waters that will be launched on the summer 2009. Premium Beauty News - Creativity appears to be the main component of your new development strategy? Sophie Thiolas - Yes, of course! One of the major trends of the latest years is the emergence of a “third generation” of retailer owned brands.  Consumers want products with an original positioning and a quality similar to branded goods.  The consequence is that retailer owned brands such as Victoria’s Secret, Boots or Sephora have gained a wide recognition.  Retailers can no longer offer “me too” brands.  With the creation of a Creative Department headed by Paul Houlsby, Maesa has achieved the restructuration that will help us to bring the creativity and innovation needed to propose the future successful retailer owned brands."
Cosmogen: Applicators must fit with formulations,"Premium Beauty News - What is the outcome of your participation in Cosmoprof this year? Denis Richard-Orliange - The number of people who visited the 2009 edition of Cosmoprof positively surprised us. In the current economic context, where everybody was expecting a dramatic decrease in the number of visitors, we noticed that less representatives of the major French brands were present while other European brands were massively present.  However, there were hardly any US brands visiting the show. Cosmogen’s obvious positioning as an innovative company helped us to attract a large numbr of customers to our stand for an update on our latest packaging innovations.  These new products will boost our customers’ sales in 2010 and 2011 through an efficient technology and an increased differentiation. Premium Beauty News - What is the edge of the offer you showcased this year? Denis Richard-Orliange - We launched two kinds of new products: – An extension of our range of tubes with integrated applicators. The offer has been extended to stainless roller applicators, silicone rollers, and spatulas, and massage heads for increasing the efficiency of formulations.  We also launched new sizes, with the “mini Squeeze”, which is adapted for contents from 5 to 20 ml. – The launch of our second dispensing system for fluid formulations, the Pump’N Tint, an airless system featuring a 20 ml piston, a cosmetic pump and a wide brush, and being entirely refillable.  The range will also be available with the wide range of applicators proposed for the Squeeze’N Tint range. Actually, the trend is clearly towards an increased customisation of applicators in order to make them fit with the formulations. Premium Beauty News - What are the key products for your development this year? Denis Richard-Orliange - Our development in 2009 and 2010 will remain focused on dispensing systems combining packaging and applicator for all types of make-up and skincare formulations."
Jackel Cosmetics: a perfect performance,"Jackel’s initial activity was an Asian sourcing business for the American and European markets then rapidly focused on the perfumery and cosmetic business. The company soon became a specialist in the transformation of zamac and aluminium, a business area in which Jackel was soon recognised as a perfect performer.  The Jackel group can now boast itself to be a world leader in this business, owning an impressive industrial equipment, located in Shenzen, People’s Republic of China, employing about 1,800 staff and a facility of 60,000 square metres.  Year after year, the investments in this factory are growing at an impressive rate. “More than ten transfer machines have been added this year and also new automatic polishing lines,” highlights Jean-Stanislas Orlowski, Jackel France’s General Director. Metal transformation is a strategic industrial axis for Jackel Cosmetics. It was reinforced last year through the acquisition of a majority of the shares of an anodising unit, JS Anodising, and the acquisition of a surface treatment unit would be already scheduled this year. “However, the activity of Jackel Cosmetics Ltd. is far from being limited to metal transformation,” says Jean-Stanislas Orlowski.  Actually, plastic transformation is now an important component of the company’s activity through dedicated product units in China, such as PCM Sinoplast (9,000 square metres) and Castle Way (18,600 square metres). Jackel’s strategy of industrial integration also features the development of cosmetic and perfumed formulas (lip gloss, lipsticks, compact powders, mascaras, fragrances) in the group’s factory, JV Cosmetics, which employs 300 staff and that was recently extended to 22,000 square metres. “This year we’re launching our own range of formulas,” Jean-Stanislas Orlowski confirms. Metal, plastic, formulations, filling and even glass-making, Jackel Cosmetics (a turnover of USD 120 millions) is now ready to provide full product development services. “The most important is our customers’ confidence. They know that, from one end to the other of the manufacturing chain, we provide a high-quality service.  Thanks to our manufacturing facilities in China and our sales network worldwide, in particular in France, our customers have guarantee the best follow-up for achieving the best results,” Jean-Stanislas Orlowski states. In France, Jackel chose to strengthen its logistics with the opening of a new platform in September 2008, in cooperation with Sitrans, and the recruitment of three additional staff. The US team was also strengthened, with Eric Bigotte and Mike Druce joining the New York office, respectively as Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales, and Vice President of Sales. Guerlain’s latest lipstick is a brand new self-explanatory illustration of the Jackel’s know-how.  The tube is made of zamac, is white nickel coated, features a magnetic closure system and needs a hand assembling of sixteen different pieces.  Jackel produced up to 100,000 units per week.  The main challenge was to comply with the design and the weight and volume specifications required by the customer."
VG Emballage bets on new products,"Premium Beauty News - VG Emballage is supplying about 2,500 customers in Europe, with a cross-sectoral and multi-material positioning, and featuring a sales force of more than 40 staff.  Quite exceptional in the industry isn’t it? Alberte Luciani - Yes it is! People often believe that we are distributors, which is true but incomplete. We can supply our customers with turn-key products, vials, finishing and closures. Moreover, we have our own moulds, our own standards and our own specific products. We also have our own technical teams, working in coordination with our subcontractors. There’s hardly any other company in Europe, if any, which can claim such a palette of competencies. Premium Beauty News - VG Emballage launched a large number of new products during 2008, in particular for the perfumery and cosmetic markets. Alberte Luciani - Every year we add new products to our offering and we complete our existing offer with additional sizes and new materials. In 2008 we completed our offering with four new foamers (foaming pumps). We also added several vials and jars to our existing ranges as well as two new airless piston pumps. Premium Beauty News - Airless is not a brand new technology for VG Emballage, you have been proposing this technology for a long time… Alberte Luciani - Actually, we have been selling airless pumps for ten years through our product Easy Bag, for which we holds two patents. Easy Bag’s particularity is to use an air proof multi-layer single-piece diaphragm Premium Beauty News - What are your expectations for 2009. It may be a difficult year. Alberte Luciani - The economic context will not be easy.  However, considering the company’s high degree of diversification, VG Emballage should prove resilient.  The outset of the year was even quite good for us, because during harsh economical times customers tend to prefer standard solutions that can be customized through specific finishing techniques and closures. This demand perfectly matches our core offering. As far as new products are concerned, we also invest a lot in the development of “Glass Polymer,” which looks like glass but is much lighter. After the launched of our BeSafe safety closure, 2009 should also be marked by the launched of a new pump with a double protection against opening, and responding to current market demand for safety."
Trimex: a French success story in Australia,"Trimex employs about 800 staff, for an annual turnover of AU$ 75 million (EUR 39,2 million). The company also runs a 6,200 m2 warehouse. Furthermore, Trimex offers access to a network of 2,200 points of sale. “Actually, that’s one of our main assets”, says Jean-Marc Carriol.  “Many distributing companies did not understand, at least at the beginning,how huge this country is, and how difficult it is to supply all points of sales”. Michel-Henri Carriol arrived in Sydney in 1966, when he was appointed as the new trade attaché at the French embassy.  His mission was to advise French companies seeking for business opportunities on this faraway continent. At that time, Australia was far from being a first-list destination for most French or European exporters.  But the demand was huge and Michel-Henri Carriol did not hesitate a while before founding its own company. In 1973, he left the embassy. Initially, Trimex operated in several businesses, focusing on the French best selling industries, the  “3F”: fragrance, fashion & food. At the outset of the 1980s, Trimex eventually opted for the personal care segment and concentrated its resources on this business. This new positioning was also the result of an encounter, three years before, between Henri Carriol and Christian Courtin-Clarins, the creator and chief executive of the Clarins group. In parallel, of course, Trimex develops the positions of French cosmetics brand in Australia. In 1989, Clarins grew into a joint venture member of the Trimex Group. Thirty-six years after its creation, Trimex achieved impressive results.  Years after years the company grown up as the dominant importer and distributor of perfumes and cosmetics in Australia and New-Zealand. “We really are the prominent logistics coordinator in the health and beauty industry for this area of the world.”  And that’s not that easy to supply around 2,200 Australian point of sales, including 65 Myer stores and 35 David Jones outlets. Trimex operates a partnership office for the No.1 natural health company in France, ArkoPharma. Finally, Trimex also represents multi-national group portfolios on a long term basis such as J&J and Puig Group."
"“Eco-design is now a standard practice,” A. Hubin, Somater","Premium Beauty News - What are the main assets of Somater? Alix Hubin - The Somater Group is a renowned operator on various markets, in particular for offset decorated rigid tubes for pharmaceuticals, high-end air-blown injected cosmetic bottles with optimised and high-tech decoration, mascaras that we produce with a high productivity technology, blown extruded or co-extruded bottles, decorated or not, with automated packaging processes in order to reduce handling. With the purchase of the former Polyflex plant, which became Plastuni Normandie, Somater strengthened its already strong reputation as an air-blown plastic transformer.  There was a very good know-how in this factory, it just needed to be developed through new investments, and that’s exactly what we did. Our investments account for 8% of the group’s turnover. For the Plastuni Normandie factory the rate reached 10%. Indeed, we purchased new air-blown injection machines, we reorganised and modernised the serigraphy equipment, and invested in new machines for improving the way we pack our products and reducing transportation costs. Premium Beauty News - What is the outcome of 2008 for your company? Alix Hubin - 2008 was a good year for the entire group. Thanks to our reactivity and our rapid decision making process, we are able to accompany our customers on many projects, even those requiring heavy investments. We recently participated in the launch of prestigious ranges, such as the line Démaq, Lancôme, Clarins’ new Lift Minceur or Bourjois’ new So Delicate gloss; and the new Efferalgan 1g with an easy opening system for which our customer, Bristol Myers Squibb got a Pharmapack in January 2009. All these launches were the occasion of advanced technological innovations.  For instance, in order to make the Lancôme bottles, we invested in high-tech robotised tools.  The decoration on Clarins and Bourjois bottles was only possible through special machines. Our motto has always been that when a company stops investing is a company that is just about to shut down. Thus we never hesitated to support our customers and to follow them when they needed, in particular to invest in the manufacture of their next launches. Premium Beauty News - And what is your vision for 2009? Alix Hubin - 2009 is likely to be a difficult year.  The dramatic stock clearing operated by our customers, mainly in high end segment, is directly transformed into postponed orders.  It is very difficult to know whether these delays are linked to a strong decrease of consumption or to a new form of supply-chain management. The shortening of payment delays may also contribute to this situation. Small mass retailers and beauty institute might have reconsidered their purchasing policy in view of the new French “law for the modernization of the economy”. There’s a real question regarding the possible impact of this law on the cash flow of the smallest retailers and on their purchasing policy. To date, beauty products in the mass market channel appear to be least affected. The quantity of calls for tenders remains high. There is a real will to launch new products to enhance the demand. I consider it is a sign that the industry is still very active and wants to prevent any risk of recession. As far as we are concern, our financial strength allows us to resist to the current recession. So far, I remain careful and not too worry for 2009. If necessary, we’ll not hesitate to take any necessary measures if we see that orders do not come back while our customers should have entirely cleared their stocks. 2009 will be a challenging year in the packaging industry, which is used to that. The new factor is that it will also be a challenging year for beauty operators. Premium Beauty News - Is there a risk that environmental concerns do not survive difficult economic times? Alix Hubin – I consider as a very positive sign the fact that despite “the crisis, environmental concerns still top the agenda. A growing number of calls for tenders require using recycled materials, even though these materials are not always the best option from a cost efficiency viewpoint. As far as we are concerned, we integrate eco-design practices on a routine basis in our work and our customers do really appreciate that. Eco-design is now a standard practice and there is no possibility to step back, whatever the economic context is. It is a real source of improvement, with demonstrated technical and economical impacts. Somater has initiated the process to be ISO 14001 certified. We are combining eco-manufacturing with the eco-design, through massive investments in low-consumption electrical machines, by making a wide use of frequency modulation to adapt consumption to the needs, and by using free-cooling for the production of iced water."
"“Make-up is offering opportunities,” S. Castelletti, Faber Castell Cosmetics","Faber-Castell Cosmetics is part of the Faber-Castell group, one of Germany’s largest and most traditional family-owned companies.  Founded in 1761, the group’s turnover achieved a turnover exceeding EUR 400 million for the fiscal year in 2007/2008.  Faber-Castell has approximately 7,000 employees in 14 manufacturing sites and currently manufactures cosmetic products in Germany and Brazil, specializing in colour applications: wood-clenched pencils, capillary systems and liquids. Premium Beauty News - What is the outcome of the year 2008 for your company?  Stefano Castelletti - Faber-Castell Cosmetics consistently develops new make-up concepts combining both product and packaging innovations. In 2008, we presented Double Deluxe, our luxury collection for eyes, with a new 3-D decoration technique offering a sensitive reptile ""touch"". Another example is Truly Natural, an overall ecological make-up concept with a formula certified by Ecocert, FSC-certified wood and a cap made out of biodegradable material. We also work in interdisciplinary teams with our stationary company to jointly interpret technical expertise in writing instruments into cosmetics. There’s definitely more to come for 2009! Premium Beauty News - Forecasts for the year 2009 are not very optimistic. Within such a context, what is your message to the rest of the industry? Stefano Castelletti - Despite of downturns the dynamic market for make-up is offering opportunities on a global scale. We should focus on what is important, the products and our business, in an environment that is more sensitive, demanding and ambitious. At Faber-Castell, we have been managing efficiency regardless of economic downturns and have never really stopped optimising costs, performance and innovation. We will need more focus and cautiousness than before. Premium Beauty News - Is there a risk that environmental concerns do not survive difficult economic times? Stefano Castelletti - Sustainability and respecting the environment are counted among the core values at Faber-Castell to the extent that Count Anton Wolfgang von Faber-Castell, chairman of the board, was nominated “Ecological Manager of the Year 2008” by WWF (World Wide Fund For Nature) Germany and the economic magazine Capital. As such we will continue on managing our business with the sustainability principles that are traditional for Faber-Castell from product development to factory emissions: ecological balance and ecological reporting. It’s our Nature because we are convinced that business success implies ethic standards."
“The European market dropped about 2%”,"Premium Beauty News - What is the outcome of the year 2008 for your company? Guy Mallinson - Our turnover dropped about 4%, in particular because our exports outside Europe drastically decreased as they were impacted by the weakness of the US currency. In parallel,the European market dropped about 2% while sales were very low during the fourth quarter. Premium Beauty News - What is your vision for the next six months? Guy Mallinson - Beyond general uncertainties, we expect the first quarter to be very difficult, in particular for the perfumery and cosmetics business where orders will be fragmented and projects delayed. Premium Beauty News - How does your company intend to overcome the recession? Guy Mallinson - If there’s no demand we’ll suspend our production.  However, we think important to keep prices at a level allowing us to remain profitable and able to invest in the long term.  Price hikes that we obtained in 2008 are not enough, even when considering recent that raw materials continued to decrease recently. Premium Beauty News - So, what about innovation? Guy Mallinson - Iggesund is investing huge human and financial resources in order to reach an almost unrivalled level of quality. We have launched the New Invercote in July 2008, bringing a fresher whiteness to the market, while preserving the qualities of a “chic and warm” product that remains elegant throughout years.  Furthermore, whiteness durability, which is a factor as important as initial whiteness, was improved.  Actually, these investments should help us to accelerate product improvements and I think that several novelties will be visible in 2010. Premium Beauty News - Environment and sustainable development are the new buzzwords in the industry. How do you address this challenge? Guy Mallinson - Traditionally, Iggesund used to be extremely discreet and did not really communicate on this issue.  Actually, Iggessund should be presented as a model, in particular if we consider the amount of money that was invested in processes and equipments for cutting harmful emissions and decreasing energy consumption (in particular of fossil fuels). Our latest project to date is the implementation of a plan to reduce oil consumption in our Swedish plant, with the aim to be close to zero within 2 or 3 years."
Caution and pragmatism for SGD in 2009,"“As far as the perfumery industry is concerned, we must be cautious since the recession, which probably climaxed in the USA, will worsen in Europe,” says Laurent Zuber.  In a context of global crisis, “only Brazil and, to a certain extent, China, appear to be able to resist,” he adds. However, SGD can rely on strong assets, Laurent Zuber explains: “thanks to our global implantation - six plants, seven furnaces, in France, Spain, in the USA, Russia, China and Brazil - we can even out the effects of the current economic cycle”. Premium Beauty News - Hopefully, the beginning of 2008 was very positive for SGD. Laurent Zuber - Actually, despite premonitory signs in Spain and in the USA, the first half of 2008 scored a growth rate of 7%.  However, from September, everyone witnessed a rapid and general downturn, which was unpredictable.  Eventually, we closed 2008 with a growth of more than 2% at fiscal year-end. Premium Beauty News - So what about the outset of 2009? Laurent Zuber - Since the beginning of the year, business slowdown has been very strong, with low range visibility over future orders.  There has been a massive stock clearance from our customers.  Paradoxically, we can already forecast a strong increase of the demand for glass vials as soon as the crisis ends, with a risk that the demand largely exceeds the production capabilities of glassmakers. Premium Beauty News - What is the best investment policy in such a context? Laurent Zuber - We carry on our ambitious investment policy, but we have adjusted it to the current economical environment. Premium Beauty News - And innovation? Is it still possible to make innovative glass products? Laurent Zuber - Yes, we just demonstrated it with the development of our “Infinite Glass”, which is made of 100% recycled glass and has triggered strong interest.  Some of our customers have already initiated creative reflections. Premium Beauty News - Is it the result of the work of your creative workshop? Laurent Zuber - SGD’s creative workshop was created five years ago and we are constantly working to develop new technologies and new decorative materials. The creative workshop contributes to differentiate us from our competitors: all our glass development or decorative innovations are located in one single place. Our customers come there to finalize their projects.  Furthermore, this workshop is the place where we create the Trends Books that we present to customers. Premium Beauty News - SGD participated in major launches during the latest months. Laurent Zuber - It is not possible to mention all of them here, but let’s point out some most illustrative examples: “For Him” and “For Her” by Narcisso Rodriguez, “One Million” by Paco Rabanne, or “MaDame” by Jean-Paul Gaultier, with a bottle carved like a block of glass."
Toly to produce lipstick tubes in India,"Toly has announced that they have extended their product portfolio to include lipstick packaging. A new custom lipstick was launched for Hindustan Unilever. Toly’s first lipsticks are being produced in their new factory in India as lipsticks are the No.1 product when it comes to colour cosmetic sales in India. Toly will now introduce its new standard mechanism to its western customer base such that they can tap into Toly’s new capabilities from India, China or Malta."
Oeakametall seeks to capitalize on its strengths,"“Actually, it’s true that the car industry is in a very harsh situation while, the cosmetics industry remains in a better shape, so far,” explains G. Oehlhorn, Oekametall’s CEO. With a turnover of 35 million euros in 2008, the German company remains one of the main European manufacturers of mascara and lip-gloss containers (75% of the cosmetics business), and lipsticks cases.  “The development of our mascara business has been a strong propeller for our company during the last three years,” G. Oehlhorn underlines.  Actually, one of Oekametall’s main assets is its ability to handle the whole manufacturing process, including the manufacturing of traditional brushes. “And will soon be able to make plastic brushes,” G. Oehlhorn adds. “This asset is strengthened by our structure: we are a familial company with a very high reactivity and quick decision-making processes, we have always been able to adapt ourselves to changing circumstances and to integrate other cultures,” says G. Oehlhorn. Today’s, the group runs two manufacturing units: one is in Bamberg, where are located metal and plastic transformation, finishing workshops, assembly lines and the production of brushes; the other one is the brand new CCO plant in Korbussen, which is specialized in surface coating, whether lacquering, polishing or metallization. A new production line for lip-glosses flocked applicators has recently been added to the COO’s manufacturing equipment.  “Also note that, during the last decade, we have been working with a subcontractor in the Czech Republic for small series and hand assembly,” G. Oehlhorn adds. The next step for the Oekametall is the reorganization of the decision-making process with the aim to enhance the potential for added-value creation.  “Believe me, there’s a lot of work to do,” G. Oehlhorn says.  One more singularity for Oekametall, since the company will implement a method inspired from Japanese cars maker Toyota!"
The beauty industry seeks to reenchant cosmetic products,"As a first step, participants tried to identify the roots of difficulties that pre-existed the credit crunch, and that emerged on the occasion of the global slowdown in the form of a shift in the status of cosmetic products. Why “products that used to sell better than the average consumption rate, did suddenly become less performing?” questioned Joël Palix, President of Clarins Fragrance Group. Brands have failed to “listen the society, and the evolution of what does luxury mean,” commented Nathalie Duran, Deputy General Manager of YSL Parfums.  Luxury, in particular for the youngest generations, is less linked to a specific object than “to experiences, relationships,” she said. For Joël Palix, these difficulties come from “the lack of investment in the training of people who are in charge of selling products” and the subsequent lack of knowledge about the product itself and what are the key factors of product quality. Thibault Ponroy, Director of International Luxury Purchases for AS Watson/Marionnaud, insisted on the price issue: “In France, excepted in 2007, the growth of the market in value was just hiding the stagnation or the decrease of volumes sold.” For Xavier Renard, General Manager Fine Fragrance & Beauty Care Europe at IFF, some explanations might be found in “the high rhythm of launches leading perfumers to develop new fragrances within delays that do not allow them to match with the level of innovation awaited by the market”. Actually, participants agreed that the offer’s segmentation is becoming unclear, with old landmarks almost entirely blurred.  “There’s a clear difficulty to identify one’s target. To easily sort products designed for the prestige channel from those designed for the mass market,” said Vera Strubi, the Honouring president of the Beautyfull Club. Indeed, “the middle market appears as an attractive reference for most business models. However, niche brands demonstrated it is possible to sell expensive products when they are highly differentiating”, Thierry de Baschmakoff, the founder of the design agency Aesthete, said. Thibault Ponroy therefore called for a “comeback to smartness”. Since, “the only justification of a price is the creation of value”, he said. While participants widely shared this analyse they paradoxically also regretted the increased triviality and lack of differentiation of products, with “perfumes made in three months, and others in three years,” but sold at very similar prices, and just distant by “a few centimetres from one the other on retail shelves”. The creation of more added-value would imply to go back to the sources of the “spirit of enterprise,” suggested Vera Strubi.  In order to reintroduce passion and pleasure in the product development process, she proposed to create small multidisciplinary teams, featuring staff from all the company’s departments: sales, marketing, purchases, etc. It was certainly not by chance if the Honouring president of the Beautyfull Club was promoting the opening of vertical borders!  “Marketing teams must meet suppliers on a regular basis, in order to be able to negotiate with the company’s purchasing department,” she explained. A point of view Thibault Ponroy shared. “It is important not to be submitted to its own job, to be able to escape from the daily work in order to think and analyse, in particular through exchanges within the industry, with brand owners, retailers and suppliers,” he said.  Exactly what the Beautyfull Club is aiming at! Of course it was not possible to speak about value creation without mentioning innovation! According to Gérald Martines, General director of RPC Beauté, “in a market with such a plethoric offer, brands imperatively need to stand out from the mass”. There is subsequently strong pressure to innovate for packaging suppliers. With, sometimes, “impossible requests” from brands simultaneously asking for low production costs, short time to market and innovation. “Eventually, innovation is always the adjustment factor, with existing and well-known solutions being chosen in order to limit risks”. Behind the question of time lays the question of launches and their rhythms.  For Joël Palix, “It is important not to forget that the date initially scheduled for a launch is not settled for ever. One should never launch a product without being ready and proud of the product”.  With the aim to carry on producing perfumes and cosmetics that make consumers dream, the President of Clarins Fragrance Group is betting on “slow design”, by reference to the “slow food” movement that was born in Italy in reaction to junk food. “We are working in the long-term. We are currently preparing the products that will be launched in the next three or five years”. For Joël Palix, a part of the solution is in the hands of retailers who may start making a selection among the endless succession of novelties.  A task Thibault Ponroy is ready to fulfil.  “It is the mission of retailers to select the offer, and to contribute to segment the market in its outlets,” he said."
IFF opens creative centre in Shanghai,"The centre includes state-of-the-art creation and application facilities, as well as a consumer insights centre that allows IFF and its customers to gain deeper understanding of the rapidly-changing needs and preferences of this dynamic region.

LVMH announces another year of growth in 2008,"Group share of net profit was stable compared to 2007 and came to 2,026 million Euros. “The 2008 results demonstrate the exceptional reactivity of our organization in this period of economic crisis. The Group has always emerged stronger from previous economic downturns thanks to the dynamic innovation of its brands, the quality of its products and the effectiveness of its teams. LVMH approaches the challenges and the opportunities of 2009 with confidence and determination and has set the objective of increasing its leadership position in the worldwide luxury goods sector,” said Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO of LVMH. Perfumes & Cosmetics registered organic revenue growth of 8% in 2008. Profit from recurring operations reached 290 million Euros.  The current operating margin reached 10%. According to LVMH, Christian Dior continued to win market share. ""The vitality of its star perfume, J’Adore, and the success of Dior Homme Sport, have contributed to the brand’s strong momentum. Make-up is growing fast and has benefited from the success of the Dior Addict and Diorshow lines."" "" The excellent performance of Guerlain was supported by the successful launches of the masculine perfume Guerlain Homme and Le 2 mascara. The principal drivers of Givenchy’s growth were the continued progress of Very Irresistible, the launch of the masculine fragrance Play and the new mascara Phenomen’Eyes. Benefit enjoyed rapid growth in China and confirmed its worldwide success, "" LVMH added. In 2008, Selective Retailing registered organic revenue growth of 9%. Profit from recurring operations was 388 million Euros. According to LVMH, ""DFS revenue grew slightly. The slowdown in Japanese tourism was offset by the momentum of other Asian clients. DFS benefited from this trend through the opening of the Macao Galleria and the airport concessions at Mumbai and Abu Dhabi. Opening new stores in these destinations requires short-term investment but constitutes an important source of future growth"". ""Sephora continued its strong momentum in 2008 which resulted in market share gains and a continued good level of profitability. Revenue growth on a same-store basis was steady. The brand is expanding its presence in key markets and continues the evolution of its existing store network. On-line sales have shown strong growth in France, the US and China. Sephora continued its differentiation strategy with a more innovative and exclusive product offering, complemented by a large range of in-store services and treatments."""
Weckerle plans to takeover Dr. Scheller Cosmetics’ production,"Thomas Weckerle, owner and CEO of Weckerle, and Reinhold Schlensok, chairman of Dr. Scheller Cosmetics, said they already agreed upon the essential framework conditions.  According to the proposed agreement, Weckerle would take over Dr. Scheller Cosmetics’ production premises, factory buildings and facilities in Eislingen (Germany).  All of the current 200 jobs would be maintained. Originally a manufacturer of automatic machines for the production of lipsticks, Weckerle has developed into a globally established contract manufacturer. “By taking over Dr. Scheller’s business with trademarks, Weckerle expects to get access to strategically important customers in Europe and overseas,” Thomas Weckerle said in a release. Through this transaction, the Weckerle Group also aims at expanding its field of action in Germany. “Weckerle has a strategic and long-term interest in the location of Dr. Scheller Cosmetics in Eislingen,” said Thomas Weckerle. “It is a production plant that has grown over decades and is successful because of competent and reliably operating employees with excellent know-how in the production of decorative cosmetics and toothpaste,” he added. Weckerle operates other production units in Switzerland, France, North- and South-America. As far as Dr. Scheller is concerned, the divestment should help the company to concentrate their financial and personnel resources fully on promoting their brands.  Dr. Scheller’s portfolio features brands such as Manhattan, Manhattan Clearface, Dr. Scheller Naturkosmetik and Phyto Solutions. In connection with the take-over, both parties plan a medium-term agreement concerning production cooperation, in order to guarantee a trouble-free hand-over of the business. According to this agreement, Weckerle will continue  to deliver the products that Dr. Scheller Cosmetics produce now at the site, for the next 5 years. Weckerle and Dr. Scheller Cosmetics declared their aim is to sign the agreement on the 2nd of April, 2009 with the take-over to occur the same day."
Trade association launched to promote airless systems,"In an exclusive interview with Premium Beauty News, Mrs Lucyna Silberstein, Megaplast’s General Director and APA’s President, describes the strategy and priorities of the new association. On its first year of existence, APA intends to promote airless designs widely in Europe, focusing on the systems’ strengths making them increasingly popular among cosmetics, pharmaceuticals or foods manufacturers, in particular their contribution to formulas’ preservation and their ability to dispense 100 percent of the product. Premium Beauty News - First of all, could you describe what airless designs are? Lucyna Silberstein - Actually, one of our first actions was to provide a relevant definition of these products.  We agreed that an airless design is a non-pressurized dispensing system, combining a mechanical pump with an airless filled and sealed container, delivering the product without air aspiration. The container is either flexible or rigid, with a hose or a piston. Premium Beauty News - Why such an association? Lucyna Silberstein - Our main goal is to develop the global market for airless products, mainly through communication initiatives promoting the systems and highlighting their strengths, in particular to final consumers. It is obvious that this kind of campaign will be helpful to brand owners - our customers - who are making the choice innovation and added value.  For us, it’s a way to accompany and support them in this direction. Last but not least, we intend to create an “Airless” quality labelling that will guarantee that airless designs comply with APA’s specifications. Premium Beauty News - What about APA’s workload in 2009? Lucyna Silberstein - As a first step, we are preparing a press kit providing more details about the association.  We are also finalising a strategy to send out press releases and information to both the industry and general media, in particular we want to target the women’s press. Furthermore, we are working on a website with the aim to put it online by the 1st of March 2009. Eventually, we should start working on the quality labelling by the end of the year."
Maesa to focus on growth,"Founded in 2003, Zorbit has a similar organization to Maesa, with integrated design, engineering, project management and quality control, backed by a wide network of producers based in Asia, Europe and the American continent.  Based in New York, Zorbit has offices in Los Angeles and Shenzhen (People’s Republic of China).  In just five years, Zorbit has become a U.S. leader in the design and manufacturing of tailor-made products for the beauty industry. The company generated 23 million dollars in revenues over 2007, and around 45 million dollars in 2008. The acquisition of Zorbit should help Maesa to strengthen its presence in North America.  Maesa Inc., the company’s U.S. subsidiary created at the end of 2006, has moved to Zorbit’s headquarters, just a few hundred meters away its former premises, and a specific management committee has been created for the North American Region, and three of Zorbit’s founders, Howard Sherman, Tom Butkiewicz and Scott Oshry have joined the Group’s steering committee. The business combination has created a group with 200 staff, serving more than 150 clients from out of seven offices in Europe and the US, with a business volume of around 74 million euros in 2008, spread over four business lines: Maesa Beauty (26 million euros), Maesa Home (23.8 million euros), Maesa Promotions (4.9 million euros) and Maesa Packaging (19.3 million euros). Over the next year Maesa will focus its development “on the deployment of high creative value-added retailer brands on the one hand, and the outsourcing of resources on the other, notably on packaging, for luxury and beauty brands,” the company said in a release. The group also said to be confident regarding its ability to meet the target that was set three years ago for 100 million euros in revenues in 2010. To accompany its development, Maesa strengthened its management team in Europe with the arrival of a new Chief Executive Officer for Maesa Beauty and Maesa Home Europe and a Chief Procurement Officer. New Chief Executive Officer of Maesa Beauty and Maesa Home Europe, François Duquesne, 43 years old, has a strong backaground in the luxury and beauty world. He has been a director and President USA at L’Artisan Parfumeur, while at the same time heading up the American business of two other Cradle Holdings Group brands: Erno Laszlo cosmetics and Penhaligon’s perfume and fragrance products. Laurence Hyest, 48 years old, is taking over from Cédric Noël as Chief Procurement Officer for Maesa.  She has a 25 year experience in Procurement and Development in the perfume industry.

"“Innovation and quality are the propellers of our growth”, Pierre Miasnik, Fiabila","Premium Beauty News - What have been the highlights of 2008 for Fiabila, in particular with regard to innovation? Pierre Miasnik - Whether in France, Mexico, India, Japan or in the USA, the totality of Fiabila’s manufacturing sites recorded increased activity in 2008.  In the USA the volume we produced has doubled.  Even though we expect decision makers to turn very careful on these various markets, we remain confident, in particular when considering our order backlog and Fiabila’s financial strength. We have always regarded innovation and quality as the key propellers of our steady growth since more than 30 years.  Today, only to speak about France, 20% of our staff is involved in research and development. Last year, we finished the conception and industrial implementation of a new method to produce thixotropic gels.  This impacts the quality of products, their fluidity and brightness. Furthermore, we concretized a technical partnership in the USA with NaturalNano Inc. regarding the use of natural nano tubes in nail polishes.  These tubes are used to serve as vehicles for active substances that will slowly diffuse in the product.  Their action can therefore be time-controlled. Premium Beauty News - Environment and sustainable development are the new buzzwords in the industry. How do you address this challenge? Pierre Miasnik - Of course we’re still hardly working on water-based enamels. Our investments related to safety, productivity and working environment are growing strongly.  Installing sprinklers on the entire production site of Maintenon (France) implied to invest more than 2 million euros. Production induce pollution, raw materials consumption and requires energy…  Why should we produce low quality enamels that will not be used and that will be destroyed eventually? The market is crowded with such products.  Our mission is to produce high-quality formulas only, in that way we contribute to protect the environment. Premium Beauty News - What is your position with regard to the development of full-service? Pierre Miasnik – Structurally, we are subcontractors both for the production of bulks and the filling of products.  That does mean we have the manpower, the equipment, the computers and plenty other required resources. There’s only a small step from subcontracting towards full-service, and we have been proposing it for several years."
"“Competition will not be detrimental to the environment”, Philippe de Brugière, L’Occitane","Premium Beauty News - What have been the highlights of 2008 regarding new launches and innovation for L’Occitane? Philippe de Brugière - 2008 was a transition year.  Launches were aiming at reinforcing the positioning, the legitimacy, the value and efficiency of each product in proposed to our women customers.  This policy was also applied to products’ packaging, where we chose not to introduce breakthrough innovation.  Generally speaking, we focused on the know-how of our suppliers and we have been seeking in every little place on the planet to find the best quality/price ratio. We focused on improving the quality of the manufacturing in order address higher expectations from Asian customers.  We have performed series of tests and issued new specifications in order to improve the aesthetics and reliability of the packaging. Actually, the real breakthrough is occurring silently, in a humble way, in order to be always more consistent with our eco-friendliness commitments. This breakthrough will only be possible with the help of our suppliers. Premium Beauty News - Many industry insiders are announcing harsh times in 2009. What is your message to the supply side for this new year? Philippe de Brugière - Well it’s a plain message that makes the headlines.  Brands have started a fierce competition to keep their market shares.  Huge investments are made in order to appeal customers, with unprecedented retail offers.  These efforts have a cost. L’Occitane is not different and we are expecting our suppliers to share at least a small part of the efforts we are making.  Supporting our sales is also supporting their business.  They are dependent on our sales.  In such a situation, being a fair player means to rethink its own business, to eliminate useless burdens and costs.  Pro-activity is required and being the first to make proposals is important. Premium Beauty News – Is your business impacted by the current volatility of raw material markets? Philippe de Brugière - L’Occitane is partly protected from these fluctuations, the first reason being that we are making our best to reduce the weight of our packaging.  However, we had to fight against general pressure. We also seize this opportunity to question some established business relationships and to meet interesting new suppliers. The cooperation between our Development and Purchase departments proved to be efficient. Premium Beauty News - Is there a risk that environmental concerns do not survive difficult economic times? Philippe de Brugière - On the contrary I think that environmental concerns will be reinforced by the crisis.  I am going to be iconoclastic but we do no longer make packaging for the pleasure of making packaging.  We merely seek to preserve our products together with the environment. We have seized the growing interest in sustainable development as an opportunity to launch several initiatives that would have been longer to develop otherwise, but we are not going it alone.  The important, is to be able to make a smart selection between all the options, to sort good and bad ones, to find the right partners, who will cooperatively and proactively explore a new direction.  Eco-design is now a full part of our projects development process. Premium Beauty News - What is your supply policy with regard to “full service” opportunities proposed by some suppliers? Philippe de Brugière -L’Occitane is producing a wide variety of products in its manufacturing facility in Manosque, using a range of processes. In particular, we produce everything linked to essential oils, it’s our core business. The plant’s capacity is always growing. At the same time, research needs to be more and more specialized, and investments in state-of-the-art processes are required. Over the latest years we have developed industrial partnerships with companies offering specialised know-how or technologies and complying with our quality insurance requirements and our brand’s values. As far as we are concerned, full service is not an externalisation strategy, its added value for our brand and the company’s know-how.  It’s exactly the philosophy that lays behind the launch of ‘L’Occitane do Brasil’ this year, the first sun care range with 100% mineral filters, which is made in Brazil using ingredients from the Amazon region and locally produced packaging."
Sothys: eco-responsible luxury and marketing reactivity in 2009,"Premium Beauty News - What have been the highlights of 2008 in terms of new launches and innovations for Sothys? Stéphanie du Chaxel - As far as Sothys is concerned, the outcome of 2008 is very positive.  We have been exploring new areas with many innovations in the fields of cosmetic science, and communication, and also in packaging, including heavy research investments in eco-design for our new eco-friendly and organic line: Beauty Garden® by Sothys. It was a challenge for our marketing team to combine our image of elegance and originality, with the organic option of the line, and the company’s eco-responsibility.  Primary packaging are made of recyclable materials. Beyond that first step we also worked extensively on the design of secondary packaging, using a lightened cardboard that is sourced from sustainably managed forests, vegetable inks for the printing, and designing the box so as we can mark instructions of use on its reverse side…  As a result, we have achieved full consistency between the packaging, the brand’s aesthetical values and the environmental expectations of consumers. Premium Beauty News - Forecasts for the year 2009 are not very optimistic. Within such a context, what is your message to the supply side? Stéphanie du Chaxel - In such a particular economical environment, sales forecasts become a key component of the management of projects.  We therefore expect high levels of responsiveness from our suppliers, so as they can adjust to necessary corrections. Reactive and reliable suppliers, being able to propose a real partnership during these harsh times while addressing tomorrow’s key issues, will stand out from the mass. Premium Beauty News - The volatility of raw materials prices does not simplify your daily business. Stéphanie du Chaxel - That’s true, in particular because our retail price policy cannot change at the same pace as the prices of raw materials. The only advantage of this situation is that marketing and development teams, now have strong incentives to analyse and optimize value and costs, in cooperation with our Department of internal method and our suppliers. Premium Beauty News - Will environmental concerns survive difficult economic times? Stéphanie du Chaxel - As far as Sothys is concerned, sustainable development is not superficial window-dressing but a deeply rooted commitment.  Mr Bernard Mas, Sothys’ chairman founder, explains recently explained for our company sustainable development is “the conceptualisation of values that we already put into practice in 1970, when we make the bet to develop worldwide a family-owned company based in provincial France”. [1] Our commitment goes far beyond the creation of a botanic garden [Jardins Sothys, editor’s note] and our daily efforts to preserve the environment through our manufacturing practices that comply with ISO9001, OHSAS and GMP standards.  Indeed, eco-design is at the very heart of our marketing strategy.  The latest illustration is the creation of the C Renewal System TM line. For this high technology and high-end line with elegant graphic specifications, we also worked extensively to lighten cardboards’ weight. Premium Beauty News - Owners of luxury brands are apparently modifying their supply policy with regard to “full service”. What about Sothys? Stéphanie du Chaxel - Full-service is something we scarcely use.  There are two main reasons for that. The first one is that we focus on the control of our supply sources, with strengthened quality controls, as per the company’s stringent specifications. The second is that, in compliance with the sustainable development principles, we think it is important to rely on our own local staff than making the choice of external suppliers in France or abroad."
"The BeautyFULL club: only the industry, but all the industry","Premium Beauty News - You seem to be optimistic regarding the BeautyFULL Club and its development in 2009? Charles-Emmanuel Gounod - Yes, I am. Only six months after its launch, our association, which aims at gathering leaders from the entire health-and-beauty industry, from the producers of perfumed components and cosmetic ingredients to final retailers, through manufacturers of packaging and finished products, is totalling more than sixty members.  It’s a very encouraging figure. Premium Beauty News - What is the main reason for this success? Charles-Emmanuel Gounod - I think there are many reasons for it but, one thing is certain, the BeautyFULL Club’s vocation to gather all the industry in order to work on common issues is addressing a real need. Whether your name is Intercos, L’Occitane, Kurz or Sothys, Clarins, or Guerlain, the need to share the work on some common issues has become evident. More specifically, I’m thinking about everything linked to environmental concerns, to counterfeiting or professional training. It’s no longer possible to go it alone, with the risk to miss a key factor within the industry and with the subsequent risk that all the energy invested in a project be slashed by such a lack of connection with other concerned people.  That’s the philosophy under the work made by our Environment Working Group, which is chaired by RPC’s Gérald Martines. Additional working groups are being created and will be operative in 2009. Premium Beauty News - What about the Club’s actions so far? Charles-Emmanuel Gounod - I just mentioned the working groups, some of them are starting producing results, and we are finishing to set up the others. We also launched a monthly newsletter that is informing our members about the progression of our actions. And we just debuted our monthly business breakfasts successfully.  The first edition was fully-booked, and we were delighted with the presentations made by Jean-Louis Matthiez, a product development consultant, about innovation, and by Attorney Matthieu Bourgeois, about recent evolutions regarding intellectual property rights. This kind of informative meetings perfectly matches with our members’ needs. Our website, which will make the link between our members, is being created and will be functional during the first months of 2009. Next February, we’ll invite the BeautyFULL Club members and all those interested in our activities to join us on the occasion of business lunch in Paris, with the participation of the leading industry players.  The lunch will be the occasion to debate about development opportunities for the perfumes and cosmetics industry. Eventually, with the help of our Vice-President, Thierry Lucereau, we are cooperating with the leading trade events worldwide. I’d like to thanks Aurelian de Sanctis, chief executive officer at Sogecos, the organiser of Cosmoprof, Nathalie Grosdidier, Luxe Pack general manager, and David Bondi, president of ITEC France, the organizer of Beyond Beauty Paris. Premium Beauty News - How many new members do you expect in 2009? Charles-Emmanuel Gounod - Actually we do not have specific targets in this matter.  However, if we want the BeautyFULL Club to be influential and representative of the industry, it’s clear that we need more than a handful. A hundred members is a target that is both reasonable and realistic, considering the level of “influence” we want to reach. The most important is that the BeautyFULL Club be representative of the industry’s common interest. It’s important also to note that the Club is bound to be international.  That’s the reason why we’ll participate in the leading trade events worldwide. It’s also why we are working at the very next opening of the BeautyFULL Club’s North American branch. Premium Beauty News - Economic forecasts are not very positive for 2009?  In such a context, what do you have to say to the health and beauty industry? Charles-Emmanuel Gounod - I do not want to appear as a presumptuous person but I think that the right message is very simple. It’s true that next months will be harsh.  Precisely, the Club can help to solve a large amount of problems.  Talking and working together on important issues, for the common interest of the whole industry: what is more exciting?"
