Beauty and sustainability at Creative 2009,"Every year, companies participating in Creative seem to be taking up a little more of the ecological challenge. From organic ingredients to green plastic packaging a large part of the 230 exhibitors will showcase a greener and more responsible offer. On the occasion of the show, Cosmetochem, a Swiss producer of plant extracts, is launching a range of 100% organic plant extracts, containing no preservatives, made up of 6 plant references from organic channels (raspberry, lavender, linden, elderberry, vanilla, green tea). Similarly, the Solabia group, a designer and manufacturer of molecules and active ingredients for the cosmetics, pharmaceutical and neutraceutical industries, is announcing the increase of its raw materials, actives and extracts offer, in compliance with Ecocert and/or other organic standards. Malian women producing Kaloje®, a shea-butter based range, also expect the organic certification they recently obtained will help confirm the success they met last year. Packaging suppliers also are taking up to the ecological design. Specialized since 1986 in developing packaging, paper bags, plastic bags, silk papers, ribbons, boxes and gift boxes, AK Emballages is adapting its offer to environmental protection. The company now offers a large selection of recycled and/or bio-degradable paper printed bags on a wide variety of supports such as white and brown recycled Kraft papers, white and brown special texture papers, ""Ecokraft"" paper series, to name a few. Other example, the Italian manufacturer Leoplast, was one of the first to launch into the creation of 100% organic plastic packaging materials, in 2004. Five years later, its range VegetalPlastic, a 0% oil-derived plastic packaging, represents a new generation of packaging that is increasingly winning over the cosmetics industry. ""The sustainability trend affects all market segments: mass, masstige and prestige brands are all eager to find solutions for this challenge,"" explains Muriel Lesbros, marketing consultant for Quadpack, one of Europe's fastest growing, independent packaging groups supplying prestige packaging solutions to the cosmetics and beauty markets. In the wake of its noted collaboration on the 100% ecological line Nude Skincare, Quadpack is consolidating its offer of eco-friendly products for luxury cosmetics packaging. Market analyses made by Organic Monitor, reveal that sales of organic and natural cosmetics in Europe have for the first time exceeded 2 billion of dollars in 2008. The growth continues in 2009 at a sustained pace even if it has slow down compared to 2008."
Sustainable development under the spotlight at Luxe Pack,"Premium Beauty News - The period is critical for trade shows worldwide. What about the 2009 edition of Luxe Pack in Monaco? Nathalie Grosdidier - This edition is fully booked, with a total number of exhibitors that is slightly increasing to almost 330 companies. It is the highest figure ever recorded since the creation of the show. Luxe Pack remains the leading and unrivalled place where buyers and producers of luxury goods packaging can meet. One again this year, visitors will be delighted with an offering covering almost any of materials, and featuring new products, new finishing technologies and many other innovations linked to high-end packaging. Even before landing to Monaco, visitors will also have the opportunity to prepare their visit through the show's interactive floor plan, which will be available on our new website. Luxe Pack being a real source of inspiration and creativity, we thought it was important to help visitors to catch 100% of what's related to their projects. Premium Beauty News - However, the current economic situation has forced several exhibitors to get away from the show this year. What is the impact of these cancellations on the show? Nathalie Grosdidier - Our main hope is that these customers be able to come back next year. Nevertheless, it is important to note that, despite the current situation of the economy, Luxe Pack enjoys a turnover rate which is very low, compared to the industry's standards. What's new in 2009, is the participation of 60 new exhibitors who never participated in the show before. This was made possible because the average size of stands slightly decreased, and because we were able to reorganize the floor plan. These new exhibitors will certainly contribute to the large scope of know-how and creativity that singularize the specialized offer that visitors are used to find at Luxe Pack. Premium Beauty News - What are the highlights of Luxe Pack Monaco this year? Nathalie Grosdidier - We chose to focus on two issues, which will be particularly highlighted, including through prospective studies. The first one is sustainable development, with a dedicated showcase area gathering all the eco-designed products proposed by Luxe Pack exhibitors, as well as original proposals from students of the Strate College on the theme ""more magic, less materials"". The second issue is packaging trends, with the ""Luxe Pack Trends Observer,"" which features a specific showcase and a conference and workshop. But Luxe Pack also put the lights on many other issues and professional expertise, helping professional to share their views, in particular through free admission conferences. Among many others, we are glad to propose a VIP Round Table featuring Vera Strubi, Noé Duchaufour-Lawrance and Gilles Lipovetski. I would also advice to come and discover the special exhibit of a unique selection of lipsticks gathered by Jean-Marie Martin-Hattemberg. The exceptional design and the originality of some pieces dating back to 1900 are surprising. Premium Beauty News - There are now two spin-off events in the USA and in China. What about the 2010 editions of these other Luxe Pack shows? Nathalie Grosdidier - Luxe Pack New York is now deeply rooted in the USA. The event is acknowledged as a different and efficient tradeshow corresponding to the sector's expectations. Its original formula proved attractive and the show is now a must-go event. Luxe Pack Shanghai was conceived according to the same principles that proved successful in New York and 2010 will be the third edition of the event. I think this show was launched at the right time. The number of exhibitors doubled from the first to the second edition. Furthermore, the growth rate of the country is self-explanatory of the interest of the show."
HBA conferences to focus on market trends,"The Trends Conference at the HBA Global Expo will deal with new consumer habits as they are impacted by the recession. Kicking-off the conference, Karen Grant, the Global Beauty Industry Expert at The NPD Group will present a custom HBA Survey identifying key consumer findings on what is happening in the cosmetics, skincare and fragrance marketplace and its affect on product development plans. Ms. Grant will provide an overview on how the economy has affected the beauty sector and consumer buying behaviour, including what beauty channels have been impacted the most, and the difference ethnicity and geography may have on purchasing decisions and patterns. She will then present exclusive HBA research that delves into who is currently using and not using beauty products including make-up, skin care and fragrance. The data will unveil how these findings differ by age, region, income and ethnic group. Compelling insight on why consumers have never used or stopped using beauty products in the past two years will also be discussed. Eventually, the HBA research will also analyze the length of time consumers will try a product before deciding if it is effective and their reasons for not purchasing the product again. The overall shopping experience will also come into play as well as what other products consumers buy when shopping for beauty. Other sessions to be held on the occasion of the Trends Conference at HBA will also deal with new consumer behaviours, trying to identify emerging trends and new habits, including sessions such as :""How to Market the Recessionista"" with leading experts from Bliss, Oasis Day Spa, Red Door Spa and CO Bigelow, or ""Inspirational Colors for 2010"" with trend watchers from Pantone and Ampacet, and ""How to Attract and Engage Beauty Customers During the Recession,"" presented by Allure Magazine. The Trends Conference will take place on Tuesday, September 15th at the during HBA Global Expo & Conference, at the Javits Center in New York. In addition to the Trends Conference, HBA will also provide educational programming tracks on Green Business, Private Label, and the HBA Marketing and Technical Conference. HBA Global Expo will open with a Keynote Address by organic and naturals pioneer and advocate, Horst Rechelbacher, Founder of Intelligent Nutrients and Aveda followed by a special presentation of the ""Positively Beautiful"" award by Lisa Price of Carol's Daughter."
Structural shifts in cosmetics market benefit to affordable products,"Citing recent trading figures from leading global personal care producers, Fitch - an international credit rating agency headquartered in New York and London - notes that consumers' shopping habits are moving away from premium brands to more affordable mass market products. ""Although cyclicality is an obvious reason for the decline in demand for luxury products, as consumers trade down for a short time period before trading up again when economic conditions improve, there are also arguments for a structural shift in consumer behaviour. This is because mass market products are increasingly being perceived as offering similar benefits to luxury care products at much lower price points,"" claim the authors of the report. According to Fitch, this lack of differentiation reflects in cosmetics companies' results and in their organic sales growth in the first half of 2009. While professional hair-care products and other luxury care products were in decline, mass-market cosmetic products showed relative dynamic growth in contrast, the agency notes. Fitch claims that for the six months to June 2009, L'Oréal, Beiersdorf, Estee Lauder, Shiseido and P&G's results were affected by sales decline for their prestige beauty and personal care divisions. In contrast, companies such as Henkel, Unilever and Avon, would benefit from their focus on affordable mass-market products and strong presence in emerging markets and recorded good organic growth in the first half of 2009. Fitch also identifies threats of substitution to high-end anti-aging products in the form of pharmaceutical-based injection fillers and potentially broader use of cosmetic laser applications. Statistics from The American Society of Plastic Surgeons showed that the number of individuals having minimally-invasive cosmetic procedures increased 5% in 2008 to reach 10.4 million in the US, with the popularity of these procedures growing in Europe as well. Capitalising on this trend, Galderma - a joint venture between L'Oreal and Nestle - has developed a rival product to Botox, Azzalure, which received approvals from health regulators in several European countries this year. Overall, Fitch expects growth in the global personal care sector to slow in 2009, reflecting weakened demand in developed countries, particularly as consumers may remain value and price aware. ""Emerging markets represent continuing growth opportunities for traditional personal care products (about 40% of the global cosmetics market in 2008) and are expected to grow over the long-term, driven by an increase in middle-class consumer purchasing power,"" Fitch claims."
Sustainable packaging is an emerging issue,"""Sustainably-oriented packaging is becoming a consumer expectation. It is one of a growing number of issues driven by ethics, economics and environmentalism. Economic imperatives, as well as possible greater regulation, mean that more brands need to consider sustainable packaging in order to adapt their present approach,"" commented Matthew Adams, Consumer Analyst at Datamonitor and author of the report: Sustainable Packaging Trends: Consumer Perspectives and Product Opportunities. The results of Datamonitor's consumer survey in the second half of 2008 showed within selected countries of Europe between 39% and 67% of consumers felt that packaging design has a medium or high level of influence over their choice. The highest rate of influence was found in France with consumers in Sweden also demonstrating high levels of importance. Of the seven countries in Western Europe surveyed by Datamonitor, the UK was the country where the greatest proportion of survey respondents showed high levels of concern about over packaging of products in the household goods market. Consumers in France and Spain also showed high levels of concern. ""This is a threat to unresponsive producers in the household goods market if consumers choose to react to continued excessive packaging with their own pro-active, pre-emptive methods,"" said Matthew Adamas. In 2008, 51% of French and Spanish respondents agreed they seek alternative products if they deem the one they were considering buying is excessively packaged in any way. This proportion is slightly ahead of the rest of Western Europe and markedly higher proportion than in the US."
Beyond Beauty: winds of change over the Parisian show,"According to David Bondi, Beyond Beauty Paris is a not to miss event in Europe. With nearly 600 exhibitors this year, ""it is the only European event of international scope to bring together the entire cosmetics manufacturing sector"". The Creative exhibition, in particular, is the occasion to ""maintain your relationships with your usual suppliers and stand out from your competitors with a new offer!"" Over 230 international beauty suppliers - packaging, Private Label, packing, promotional articles, machines, suppliers of ingredients and raw materials, design & style - are expected this year. ""In the heart of Beyond Beauty Paris, Creative owes its lasting presence to its ability to bring together both international leaders and small companies with targeted know-how.

China: cosmetic market to keep growing despite crisis,"Chinese cosmetics and toiletries market, which comprises of hair care, fragrances, make-up/colour cosmetics, was worth an estimated US$ 16.9 billion in 2008 and is forecasted to grow at a CAGR [1] of just over 13% through 2012, says a new report Cosmetics and Toiletries Market in China from India-based market research firm, RNCOS. According to the report, the sharp increase of the hair care and skin care segments will boost the overall cosmetic market growth in China and will safe guard the market from the impacts of the ongoing worldwide economic crisis during 2009-2012. As a result, the market is anticipated to cross US$ 28 Billion. In their report, RNCOS show that the China's economy, which recorded highest GDP growth in the Asia-Pacific region in 2008, attracted significant foreign direct investment in the cosmetics and toiletries industry of the country. China's GDP growth further transformed into considerable increase in disposable income of especially the middle class population. Increased spending power coupled with improved awareness about cosmetics and personal care offerings has shaped in tremendous boost in cosmetics and toiletries demand in the country. In addition, Chinese male consumers have shown receptive approach towards previously ignored segments of the market. For instance, fragrances and men's personal care products demand is rapidly surging in the country due to the western culture influence and media promotions. ""These new segments will not only enable the existing players to cater the high growth opportunities but will also demand new players to provide answers to overflowed demands,"" comment the authors of the report."
CVS/pharmacy expands Beauty 360 concept,"US retailer CVS/pharmacy recently opened of the third Beauty 360 location in Ridgefield, Connecticut.

"« Only the price matters », Xavier Adnet, Bormioli Rocco USA","Premium Beauty News - In a very difficult economic context for glassmakers, don't you feel some kind of tremor? What is the situation exactly? Xavier Adnet - We are far from the resurgence in trade, and we don't feel any tremor, our customers and the retailers are still looking for ways to reduce their stocks. The recession is particularly strong in the perfume sector, while the cosmetic sector remains flat. What is really worrying is that we do not see the light at the end of the tunnel. However, I am sure that our customers are aware that it will be difficult for us to react as quickly when orders start flowing in again. We will have to make choices. Premium Beauty News – What are your company's main assets? Xavier Adnet - To be acknowledged in terms of service and quality. Of course this has nothing to do with the present situation, it is a long-winded task. Premium Beauty News - In the range of products that you manufacture for the beauty sector, are some products more on the roll than others and why? Xavier Adnet - ""On the roll"" is probably excessive. Let's say that the cosmetics segment is relatively less impacted, and is only decreasing slightly, while the perfumery segment is decreasing strongly, except for the mass market. We are selling more small containers than we were used. Retailers are boosting small sizes rather than reducing the price of a big item, there is resurgence of the ""good money value"" Premium Beauty News - Perfume and cosmetic brands, seem to have fully understood the full service concept. Xavier Adnet - Nowadays, customers think ahead, they are looking for what you could call the turn key. That allows them to make economics of scales and concentrate on the working capital. We are doing our best to meet such requirement. Premium Beauty News - Environmental issues are also a concern. How do you address this issue in terms of products? Xavier Adnet - But in the United States this topic is put aside in favour of price issues. When economy is booming the American customer has no difficulty in spending a bit more to purchase a home-made product and help reduce the carbon footprint. But today the only thing that makes the difference is green, not in the sense of green/environment but in the sense green/Dollar."
Polishing the crisis...,"Premium Beauty News – In a difficult economic context, nail polish seems to be doing very well? Siegfried Prive – In these times of uncertainty, nail polish has a lot to offer in terms of attractiveness. First of all, it is a pleasure-product with a low price positioning, therefore, affordable for everyone. We also notice growing interest for this product, coming from major brands, a movement first started by the greatest designers, opinion leaders. This opens the way to a very dynamic offer on products with concepts very much linked to fashion in order to answer needs from beauty addicts. A good example of the connection between product and fashion is the offer on black and green trendy shades. Today, from, the feminine magazine, local or international, to the TV show, movie star, or even football player, no one takes a chance to ignore polish. Media visibility on polish has never been stronger. The product, through its target has rejuvenated, because even the younger ones and their tribes have monopolised polish. Obviously it is a promising sociological phenomenon for brands looking for growth engines. Finally this pleasure-purchase gesture requires a diversified product offer and some brands have understood the evolution of a polish that switched from a more static and classic image to an offer always on the move in a universe built on fashion and glamour. Premium Beauty News - Can you give us an idea, in terms of volumes, of the nail polish global market? How is it developing? Siegfried Prive - Some experts evaluate the global market to 3.5 billion bottles and the reduction in sizes seems to have reached a limit. A first evolution comes from the fact polishes are more accessible: while the concept of manicure service to the consumer was very popular in the distribution network of Beauty or Nails Salons in Asia, in the United States, in Russia, we notice that a variant, the Nails bars, is growing and developing in Central and Southern Europe which were traditionally self-service areas for polish. Of course this contributes to increase product accessibility. New packaging vectors - pens, and then patches, which attract another kind of customers; help improve availability and product attractiveness. A second evolution is linked with the stimulus offer. A classic management of a range as wide as 12 to 20 shades using umbrella brands targeted on homogeneous consumers, plus a few healthcare references has changed to more dynamism. Brands tend to be more open to the use of promotional or seasonal products, with a very short shelf life, which regenerates the offer and stimulated the interest of the end-user consumer. Some brands renew their ranges with promotional one shot offers for which shades, formulations, texture are not the only variables of innovation or of differentiation, but for which the packaging and secondary finish may also change very quickly, every 3 weeks for example. Different segment of masstige and private labels have rushed into this trend. This evolution regarding the frequency of launch generates gains in market shares for brands internally or externally organised to reduce delays and marketing costs, which reinforces the notion of partnership with manufacturers like Durlin. Premium Beauty News - Today, what is the nail polish user looking for? Siegfried Prive - Consumers are looking for novelty or product differentiation. Manufacturers like us usually respond with technological innovation and performance. Recently we have introduced in our formulations a patented polymer originally from the eye lenses industry. We have also reformulated our polishes with a less occlusive film, which increases exchanges with oxygen to allow the nail to breathe better, while improving the functional performances of the product. Along with high technological-value-added innovations, our expertise has intensified on synergisms with innovating packaging suppliers. But today, it is also our capacity to listen and anticipate fashion trends, linked with high creativity that helps us meet market expectations. Beyond consumers' expectations, product is also impacted with new regulations, which widens our field of expertise and quality service customers are looking for. Premium Beauty News - Do these changes impact your production tool? Siegfried Prive - The increasingly short life span of products and the higher number of launches have led to a reduction in the average size of production batches. But above all brand's demand is clearly aiming for a full service product, with greater expectations in terms of capacity and quick response from R&D. The faster pace in industrialising innovations generates better integration between the teams of our customers, our R&D and production. Each year our investments are planned to answers these new needs as well as the evolution of regulatory framework. This is to ensure the safety of our staff, of our installations and of our supplies to our customers. We notice that these environmental, safety constraints but also the will to reduce expenses, prompts industrial transfers from our customers to their sub-contractors, which exemplifies Durlin's acknowledged added value. Our industrial investments have developed in all our factories worldwide, thus in 2 years time, we doubled our capacity to offer turnkey products. For example on the Bergerac site (France) we have invested in the automation of our production lines in order to supply very quickly large quantities and offer high quality products, we have also increased our capacity on some sites with semiautomatic processes to meet requirements calling for flexibility and diversity. In parallel, our investments also concern quality control and our labs and R&D teams, always very active due to the frequency of new launches. Our legal department is also strongly structured in order to deal with the evolutions of different markets. The progressive enforcement of REACH and growing environmental expectations have given us a chance to re-examine our approach on raw material and manufacturing process. Durlin already certified ISO 9001 version 2008 has already applied to comply with new standards on Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) in cosmetics."
"""Let's share information about consumers,"" Thibaut Ponroy (FFPS)","Premium Beauty News - Crisis in the healthcare / beauty sector does not seem to be over yet. The whole of the supplying industry is impacted. On that point, people are blaming the de-stocking strategy of distribution networks. Thibault Ponroy – Once again I have the feeling that we are the perfect scapegoats. The original reason for the present situation the ""supplying"" industry sector is facing is not our de-stocking strategy but the consequences of consumers' disaffection and decline in attendance of outlets. For what good reason should the distribution sector be used as a variable adjustment by keeping high levels of stocks it has no real need for? Keeping stocks has a very high cost ; this cost will even get heavier by the way, due to the passing of the Law of modernisation of the Economy, Law known as LME. De-stocking is not a goal, the actual phenomenon is mainly an inevitable readjustment in times of crisis of all the financial and economical indicators of companies in the distribution sector. Eventually, in our field regarding selective distribution in the perfume industry, things have changed a lot concerning distribution. It has concentrated, professionalised, and switched in 15 years from a structure composed chiefly of SME (even VSE) to a structure composed of multinational groups, with shareholders often leaders in their field, familiar with management and quoted at the stock exchange. Premium Beauty News – The question on everyone's lips is if this situation is going to last much longer ? Thibault Ponroy – I don't have a crystal ball but I would like to give you an answer. Some economists speak of an economic revival during the fourth semester in the United States and six month later in Europe. We will see. Having said that, among the different luxury sectors, it seems that cosmetics is confirmed to stand as an exception and that our sector is suffering rather less than others. Premium Beauty News – Many manufacturers of the packaging industry are experiencing unprecedented low production levels. What is your feeling Thibault Ponroy – I can actually imagine that a lot of manufacturers are in a very severe situation, due to the weakness of production levels with all the human, social, financial and, economic consequences we witness. However could it not have been possible to anticipate earlier in order to dampen such effects? I am very surprised by the absolute lack of dialogue between the manufacturers of the packaging and distribution sector, though the only ones to be in direct contact with consumers. We should use this economic downturn to start thinking differently and take it as an opportunity to better understand the global and prospective key factors of the Cosmetic market. Distribution is a reliable and daily thermometer on customers' behaviours, doubts, concerns but also expectations. This sensibility must be better shared by all the actors of the Cosmetic sector. Premium Beauty News – During the lunch-debate organized by Beautyfull Club on February 11th, in Paris, you have called for all actors of the sector to collaborate. How can all these different professionals manage to communicate ? Thibault Ponroy – Exchanging data on consumer knowledge and consumer behaviour is fundamental. This will offers all the actors in the cosmetic sector a better visibility and a real capacity for anticipation. To achieve this we must organise and structure dialogue, create vertical links and bridges, and give a chance for all the actors in our sector to meet, whatever their business. This kind of dialog will not solve everything of course, but it can at least surely help beauty sector to progress. To organise such a dialogue is maybe also the mission to organise events like the Beautyfull Club does."
Trends in packaging design,"Respondents from across Europe, of which 62% worked in companies with 500 or more employees globally, cooperated to the survey of brand owners conducted by EskoArtwork in partnered with Adobe and the International Packaging Institute (I.P.I.) with the aim to gain a better understanding of emerging market demands. ""While most of the respondents represented global companies, half are operating in small marketing workgroups and are senior managers or professionals. We believe their responses provide an accurate portrayal of the current state of mind for most brand owners,"" says Dieter Janout, Global Director Brand Owners at EskoArtwork. The survey reaffirmed the growing popularity of and demand for, private labelling, with 54% of respondents reporting that their private label business accounted for up to 25% of revenues. Other key survey findings included the following: – Respondents strongly believed that the packaging's ability to make a product stand out on the shelf is paramount. Equally strongly held is a belief that packaging will increase in importance in its role in the marketing mix. – 56% expect a significant increase in the use of digital prototyping either 'definitely' (12%) or 'probably' (44%). – However, only 15% said that providing sustainable packaging solutions was critical to or already addressed in their businesses today. Key drivers for sustainable packaging identified by respondents included consumers (70%), regulations and legislation (64%) and retail requirements (57%). 84% thought that 'environmental and sociological constraints' would require 'significant change' (63%) or 'new ways required' (21%). – 50% thought that packaging design will adapt to the opportunities presented by the Internet as online shopping becomes more prevalent. – Respondents gave a score of 7.8 out of 10 to the assertion that 'right-sized or optimized packaging sizes' will increase in importance over the next few years."
Sluggish growth projected in the U.S. cosmetics market,"U.S. sales in the cosmetics and toiletries market grew only by 0.3% in 2008, the lowest since 1991, according to the latest study completed by research and consulting firm Kline & Company. The new data available in Kline's latest report - Cosmetics & Toiletries USA 2008 - indicates that sales have reached a total of US$35.6 billion at the manufacturers' level. Kline projects that consumer concerns about the recession may ensure that these levels do not rise higher during 2009-2010. In the recession context, consumers are showing a preference for competitively-priced products from the mass and direct trade channels. Premium products sales are being affected heavily by these negative market conditions. In fact, salon, specialty, and luxury trade classes all demonstrated negative growth in 2008, whereas mass and direct trade classes turned out to be the fastest growing segments. ""Many people have traded down on certain products, and as they get accustomed to buying some lower-priced or private-label products, and shop more in the lower-priced channels, they might well continue with those habits after the tough times have subsided. To be successful, companies will likely continue to infuse the mass segment with more sophisticated products to compete with luxury products,"" notes Nancy Mills, Industry Manager, Consumer Products practice, at Kline. Skin care, the largest product class, was also the second-fastest growing category during 2008, spurred by the sun care category. Although consumers have curtailed spending, they are not ignoring innovative and sophisticated new products. Marketers propel growth with product development, albeit the rate of new launches slows down in 2008. Some brands that did very well in the previous years such as Bare Escentuals, had slower growth in 2008, whereas, some mass brands like Garnier skin care and Neutrogena sun care showed very strong growth. Some luxury brands did buck the trend with great results — such as La Prairie."
Luxe Pack New York: a successful show in a difficult environment,"Most of the exhibitors said they were satisfied with their participation in the show; Of course, in such a dull environment, every positive signs are welcomed. Actually, in New York too, the crisis was prominent… ""US retailers would have already kissed goodbye to the holyday season,"" was the kind of rumour heard in the aisles. While, it was also possible to hear information about the level of new launches being more or less as usual. From the suppiers' side, it appeared that, once again, prices hold the centre-stage. ""We are back to front again,"" commented the representative of a plastic injection firm. ""And our customers do note hesitate to seize this opportunity,"" commented another. Within such a context several of them were openly speaking about the next bankruptcies to come."
Indian cosmetics market to stay away from global crisis,"The Indian cosmetic industry has witnessed rapid growth in the last couple of years, growing at a CAGR of around 7.5% between 2006 and 2008. With improving purchasing power and increasing fashion consciousness, the industry is expected to maintain the growth momentum (with marginal slowdown due to the global economic downturn) during the forecast period (2009-2012). It is projected to grow at a CAGR of around 7% during the forecast period, says a new report published by market research firm RNCOS [1]. The research also found that the Indian consumers are showing a highly receptive approach towards some entirely new segments such as Spa, Salon and Herbal cosmetics, which have emerged as some of the new trends in the Indian cosmetic market. ""The growth will primarily be driven by growing desire of looking young and beautiful among Indian consumers. These segments will help the entire cosmetic market to experience an upward growth trend in coming years,"" comments RNCOS Both electronic as well as print media are playing an important role in spreading awareness about cosmetic products and developing fashion consciousness among the Indian consumers. With the introduction of satellite television and a number of television channels as well as the Internet, the Indian consumers are constantly being updated about new cosmetic products, translating into the desire to purchase them. Additionally, the flourishing Indian film industry is fuelling growth in the industry by making Indians to realize the importance of having good looks and appearances. Despite the massive surge in the popularity of cosmetic products, the report finds that the average consumer spending on cosmetic products in India is much lesser than any other part of the world. This implies that the Indian cosmetic industry has an even greater potential for growth in future than present. However, manufacturers should not forget that the Indian domestic market is price sensitive and they need to work out innovative strategies to establish a foothold here, the report added. At present, most of cosmetics manufacturers in India cater to the domestic market but they are gradually establishing their footholds in overseas markets. In recent years, the Indian cosmetic manufacturers have received orders from overseas markets; for example - Indian herbal cosmetic products have a tremendous demand in the international market."
Plastic tubes: Revolution on its way,"Of course since the beginning of this year the prospects are not as good but according to the latest estimations, and depending on markets, sales will remain slack in 2009 or in the worse case will drop to - 10 %. Behind these figures half a dozen European companies manage to pull out from the pack with two unchallenged leaders, the Tupack group (1 billion alone!) and the Alcan group with more than a billion! Following, a small pack of companies including the Spanish Tuboplast that also owns CTL and Tapser (300 to 400 million), the French Soupletube (200 million), the German Linhardt (also 200 million), the Swiss Neopac… An industrial universe that has changed quite a lot during the last fifteen years with the arrival of some newcomers from Asia, Eastern countries, and even India. What about the ambitions of a company like Essel Propack that claims holding the third of the world market of the laminate tube, the headquarters of the company, located in India, weigh all sectors of businesses included, a respectable USD 2,4 billion turnover? But it has become a cruel universe where positions are earned at a high price (the cost of a production line is close to EUR 3 to 6 million) and where profitability depends more and more on the industrial strike force put in the balance. When in the end you consider a tub (plastic) is sold in Euros, around 25 cents or even 6 cents (laminate). A sector where the smallest mistake can cost you a lot. The Betts group (3 billion laminate tubes, USD 200 million in turnover) in financial turmoil presently knows something about it. Extruded plastic tube, laminate tube? Clearly the cosmetic industry uses more generally the first one than the second one. ""But things are changing"", confess professionals involved. ""The volumes are to be considered"". Favourite and historical market of the laminate tube: the toothpaste. As for the plastic tube, in a mono-material or coextruded version, it has always remained very attractive to the cosmetic industry. Especially when designers compete with one another with great cleverness in three fields: tube printing, development of new functionalities with mainly the use of new applicators, and the design of new shapes! Among the champions in these fields, Alcan Packaging Beauty, world leader in the cosmetic packaging industry that owns for the tube activity, not less than 15 manufacturing units (plastic tube and laminate tube) spread out in about ten countries. ""Thanks to its quality of print"", explains François Tassart, Alcan Packaging Beauty's Vice-President Sales & Marketing Director for the Tube Worldwide activity, ""packaging conveniences, protective properties and product delivery rate, the tube is extremely popular with the general public and retains a real potential in terms of development. Every year we reinvest continually in new machines and news production capacities. Emulation within the teams is constant to find the proper tube, the proper applicator, the proper capping system."" In close cooperation with customers, Alcan also strives into developing more and more environment-friendly tubes. ""Their work has led our teams to design lightweight caps, do away with tamper-proof films and labels, replace thermal varnishes with UV varnishes, reduce sleeve thickness and use recycled plastics"". According to Michel Cochet, Codipack, representative of the Italian manufacturer Agatech (annual Production of 25 Millions parts, Turnover +/- EUR 3 millions), ""Agatech has a production line, but to meet increasing demand, plans to open a second one before the end of the year"". He believes ""the tube holds a paramount position in every segment. It will suit any kind of finishes and finishing technology, and now offers a wide range of capping that has made it unavoidable, whatever the market."" In times of constant research for minimum costs, the cost of a tube to conditioning remains fairly low compared to other types of packaging. Versatility of this type of packaging is a major element: plurality of use, ranges in capacities, formulas it can contain, brings confirmation that this leading product is also unavoidable. Its smoothness and easiness to use allow optimal product restitution and it is also very handy to carry around, everywhere you go. ""Agatech recently widened its product offer, with a new range that was displayed at the last Cosmoprof in Bologna. It concerns tubes metalized using the FLEX technology: a technology and a know-how for a product targeting high-end markets and luxury products."" Enthusiasm is the same at Tuboplast/CTL... ""The tube as always been in an evolution process these last ten years,"" explains Eric Derouin, Tuboplast CTL Group's Sales & Marketing Director, ""in terms of variety of finishes, production speed and new functionalities. With regard to the Airless tube that we launched end of 2006 and that allows a new gesture to the end user as well as optimal protection of formulas, associated with the simplicity of a low cost easy filling process of the tubes."" ""We are clearly the first and only leader on this segment with a wide offer ranging from 5 ml to 250 ml, plastic (coex / mono) and laminate with all types of pumps from the plastic ones for mass market to the more sophisticated metal ones. It's a fast growing market. The tube is a base completely Airless with the frame of the tube, coex or airtight laminate + the Airless pump, unlike the systems with pistons where the frame of the bottle in PP, presents some porosity. The Airless system is also the less expensive in terms of product but also in terms of filling, thereby, we support a full democratisation of Airless systems and the possibilities it offers."" Not to mention the general aspect of the tube, it is clearly what is spoken of as ""commodities"" in English language. It is convenient, flexible (in terms of consumer gesture but also in terms of market launch, fast, easy to fill) cost effective (inexpensive and with high filling-up rates). With an ordinary aspect in shape, it allows infinite decorative possibilities, offset, serigraphy, hot printing ...that offers customisation without framing the brand in a shape. Segmentation according to the channel springs from this variety of finishes but the tube himself is a universal packaging, for all type of channels. It is also the perfect partner for promotional, coffrets, in""+product"", in sleeve, pocket size.... Eventually, it is a youthful gesture, clean, fast e and easy to carry if necessary. It is the reflection of our society and of our consumer behaviours. This product, finally, is never outdated, because it does not restrain the brand in a shape code, allowing it to modernise itself, with the evolutions of finishes. It is simple to use and can be sophisticated at leisure through finishing. Consumers do not need to be trained, they are seduced and provoked by appetency not by the use of it. In this era of globalisation of brands it is a unique and universal packaging in terms of positioning with the freedom for each country to customise, finish and language: now, how can you beat that?? According to Cornelia Schmid, Marketing Communication at Neopac, the tube will never go out of fashion because: ""It is convenient, easy to use, inexpensive, unbreakable, attractive thanks to its finish, less expensive that the other types of eco friendly packaging"". Capacity for innovation is a standard at Neopac. The firm has developed tubes with Airless pumps for liquids and creams, the ""Dropper-Tubes"" for nutricosmetics (drop by drop system), The Pinpoint Tube with its silicone applicator for smooth and precise applications, single use tubes for dermo-cosmetic applications... ""We focus, explains Cornelia Schmid, on four main markets in cosmetics: Luxury, with our special finishes; Natural, our tubes offer a high barrier for products with no preservatives; Wellbeing, our tubes offer specific and pleasant contact sensation, Cosmeceuticals, our monodose tubes for facials with very high barrier proprieties to protect special products from oxygen contact"". For Hans Eckhardt Cosmetics' Sales & Marketing Manager, Linhardt, (a production site for plastic tubes and two production sites for aluminium tubes and a joint-venture in Egypt, in Cairo, for the production of aluminium tubes), ""when you look at it, on all markets, the tube is self- advantageous: the luxury segment, for instance, can take advantage of a tube with serigraphic direct printing, the addition of a pump bringing even more value to it. Mass market segment will profit from a very competitive price, and great flexibility in sizes. It is obviously a major advantage with our customers asking us to be very responsive in the present economical context. The labelled tube is a good compromise between high quality printing and an excellent quality/price ratio for products sold in different countries and therefore different languages. The coextruded or laminate tube is a perfect barrier for sensitive products"". On this point, the German company offers currently a new tube, the multiflex tube (an improved laminate tube with a juxtaposed welding instead of a overlaid one which allows combination of different complexes and printing at 360°). Speaking again of novelties, the new dispensing tube from Linhardt equipped with a Rexam pump, which offers customers an airless tube with a safe and simple filling process, the filling being identical to the one implemented with tubes using caps. ""There is a great expectation coming from the market explains Hans Eckhardt, not only in terms of preservation of the content but also in terms of use and promotion. Along with the diameter 35, we also propose the diameters 40, 30 and 19 and in a few weeks time our range will see the addition of a multiflex tube combined to a pump"". ""One must admit, says Hans Eckhardt, that the tube never goes out of fashion precisely because of its versatility of use in all fields linked to cosmetics (skincare, haircare, suncare, men, etc...). And in our time where everyone feels concerned by environmental issues, the lightweight of a tube (approx. 15gr. for 150ml) combined with an excellent bleeding rate is a genuine environmental 'plus'"". It is undoubtedly a segment in which some industrial actors have decided to play a part. According to Bruno Douvillier, BDPack, and representative in France of the Swedish producer, Tectubes (EUR 30 million in turnover, 240 millions plastic tubes including 190 injected and the remainder extruded and a 105 millions in aluminium), ""if the tube is not out fashioned it is mainly for the following reasons: simple to use for the end user, simple to fill for the manufacturer, good product protection with an excellent Quality/Price ratio"". Latest innovation to have been launch onto the market by Tectubes: an injected decorated tube using the IML process (In Mould Labelling) ""which offers quality and an exceptional rendering of finishes, explains Bruno Duvillier, which allows us to be very competitive when dealing with small series""."
"""Tube got its edge,"" Eric Firmin, HCP","Premium Beauty News - What have been the main technical evolutions in the tube business since the last five years? Eric Firmin - To be honest, as far as I know, there has been hardly any important technical evolutions. Alcan-Cebal tried doing embossing directly onto the tubes to make it look like more real. Another interesting technical progress was the high-resolution picture printing on tubes. Actually, it mainly consisted in improving the printing quality on tube, whereas in the past similar results was only possible to achieve through labels or heat-transfer films. Eventually, our ""One piece Tube & Cap"" in an oval shape, and with its focus on ""environmental friendliness"", has been the main breakthrough innovation for a while. Its price is the same and it offers a 15% material reduction compared to a traditional round tube. As environmental friendliness is key for the retail, that's a great competitive advantage. Another innovation is the ""Dispensing Tube"" that we have created for liquid formulations. The conceptual background is the fact that liquid products are not packed in tubes since the product would drip out once the cap is removed. In order to improve dispensing properties, we added a silicon valve at the tube orifice to control the flow of the product evacuation. The silicon valve opens as the consumer starts exerting pressure on the tube and closes immediately once the force is released. The evacuation of the product from the tube is now regulated, which leaves it cleaner. Even very liquid product (like watery or oily products) can now be packed in a tube! Furthermore, the silicon valve system helps preventing too much air going back to the tube to deteriorate the product packed inside. Premium Beauty News - Mass-market, ""masstige"" or prestige and luxury, which segment is the best for tubes? Eric Firmin - Tube applications are traditionally predominant in the mass market and upper mass market segments. Indeed, as primarily tubes come in stock package, they cost less than other types of packaging, with less time spent in their development and limited tooling expenditure. Another reason is that tubes have a simple design (compared to a bottle requiring a dispensing pump) and they are very practical. However, the wide usage of tubes in the mass has been a limiting factor of their development in the luxury market, as brand owners were eager to prevent customers from depreciating products in packaging associated with the mass segment. Nevertheless, for certain luxury products, where portable and dispensing properties need to be enhanced, tubes remain the preferred options though the outlook will not be the same. For example, tubes exist in oval shape, most of them in screw on cap instead of flip top cap, and with secondary process (e.g. vacuum plating, spray coating) on the screw on cap, to differentiate them from the mass-market designs. Tube is also the most preferred packaging option for promotional size and free samples items in the luxury market. Premium Beauty News - Are tubes influenced by fashion trends? Eric Firmin - Not really, I think. And there is always a need for tube. In a context where everybody is talking about ""speed to market,"" tube got its edge in supporting this strategy. Also, it remains a very economical option for package with dispensing properties. I anticipate small size tube packaging still got substantial demand potential, in particular with the 100 mL size restriction in the travel industry. Tubes are still the ideal package for this kind of requirement. Premium Beauty News - What are the next steps forward? Is innovation still possible in the tube business? Eric Firmin - In my opinion, there are two different innovation streams in the tubes business, namely: construction breakthrough (including material) and decoration breakthrough. Regarding the construction side, I believe that the next development steps will be oriented towards: – the development of environmental friendly materials (bio-renewable, bio-degradable…), – the reduction of material used in the production - like our One-piece Tube & Cap, – the increased use of high transparency materials - like our Surlyn material development, – the development of high barrier properties materials, – the development of ""air-backless"" tube construction, which is linked to the reduction in the use of chemical preservative systems, implying more sophisticated packaging and requiring a very good seal to prevent contamination from the outside environment. Regarding the decoration side, the key factor of success is to achieve better quality at flat costs mainly through: – high resolution printing, which is a basic requirement for normal paper printing but remains very difficult to achieve on a tube, – combination of offset and silk-screening printing, though the technology is not new further development is required for lowering its cost."
UK retail will never be the same again,"Verdict Research is predicting just 8.1% growth in the UK over the five years to 2013, a massive drop from the increase of 14.1% in the same period to 2008 [1]. ""The good news though is that survivors will find themselves in a far less competitive environment, with major opportunities for market share gains and winning new customers,"" Verdict says. Despite the retail downturn being very much a prolonged affair, 2009 will be the year in which the market is at its weakest, with the first negative growth since Verdict Research's records began way back in 1984. Total UK retail will decline by 0.6%, or £1.7bn, whilst non-food spending will decline by 3.0%. ""This will inevitably mean more hard times for retailers and more significant casualties"". The UK's economy, including the housing market, will remain unstable over the period, undermining both consumer confidence and spending power. The main driver of the decline though will be rocketing unemployment. ""Unemployment will not peak until late in 2010, as cutbacks continue to spread outwards from the financial sector, to affect all areas of the UK workforce,"" says Malcolm Pinkerton, Senior Retail Analyst at Verdict Research and author of the report. The economic crisis is more severe than any for decades and will therefore take a much longer time to recover from. ""At present it seems we are still facing a considerable wait before the bank's balance sheets are sufficiently stable for them to resume a high degree of lending again,"" adds Pinkerton. Indeed, the return to economic growth will not necessarily herald a retail recovery. Verdict Research is predicting a return to positive GDP growth in 2011, yet non-food growth in 2011 in the UK will be just 1.1%. ""The truth is that retail very much has problems of its own,"" says Pinkerton. Indeed, the recession is not merely fostering a temporary change in consumer mindsets, agrees Matthew Piner, retail analyst at Verdict Research and the report's co-author, but providing the catalyst for a long-term transformation. ""By the end of this downturn, shopper psychology will be irreversibly changed from that of the heady days seen in the late 90's and early part of this decade,"" he says. ""Shoppers from the lower socio-economic groups in particular will have formed a more price conscious outlook and an intolerance of taking on debt to fund retail expenditure."" As such, non-food retail growth in the UK will be just 2.1% and 2.5% in 2012 and 2013, a much more reserved level than the average 6.3% annual growth seen through the nineties. Retailers will have to adapt in varying ways, but innovation, differentiation and exclusive products will need to become an integral part of retailers operations. ""Retailers will have to learn to balance the new consumer desire for quality, timeless products, with the need to drive shorter replacement cycles for areas where consumers are instinctively cutting back,"" says Piner. ""They will have to compete harder on the entry price items upon which consumers are more sensitive, whilst becoming more adept at adding value to higher priced products."" Merchandising will also need to become more efficient, both in a logistical sense and in terms of driving sales."
"""The crisis thrashes out given ideas,"" Dominique Bouvier, Strand Cosmetics Europe","Premium Beauty News - The crisis seems to stimulate you, so do new regulations Dominique Bouvier - That's true. Let's dare to say it: ""Long live the crisis!"" Actually, the shock wave of the sudden financial collapse is still impacting the general economy. By trashing out all given ideas, the crisis implies that we use some common sense again. That's an occasion to develop more balanced business relationships and healthy partnerships between customers and suppliers, on a win-win basis and a mutual respect of each-others. Freedom is not just another word for jungle law, freedom implies that operators on the market be aware of the span of their responsibility. That's precisely the aim of the future European regulation, and of the recent French law for the modernization of the economy, which clearly stress solidarity and economic efficiency. Premium Beauty News - Strand's new collection reflects this optimism? Dominique Bouvier - Yes. We're strongly confident in our ability to guide our customers in the beauty world, and we have designed a collection of skin care and make-up products to generate strong emotions. ""Ritualis"", for instance, was born from questions regarding the meaning of our cosmetic rituals. Inspired from sacred rituals, pagans heritage or rites of passage, all our cosmetic habits aims at increasing attractiveness. The range features futurist formulations, evolving textures, all what's needed to charm customers. For the eye's area, we developed: – ""Stay-on Eye Shadow"" is a range of smooth eye-shadows, with delicate and bright colours, for mysterious and innocent eyes, – ""Energetic Eye Liner,"" a product designed to highlight the eye with a virginal white line (great effect on a tanned skin), – ""Mythic Khôl,"" inspired from oriental customs. And also: – ""Skin Perfect Prep"", a transparent complexion enhancer that beautifies the skin, – ""Snow Flake Peeling"", white and fresh as the snow… to remove dead cells and impurities, – ""Voile Lacté,"" that wraps the body into a moisturising veil that smoothes the skin. And many other novelties combining innovation and pleasure… Premium Beauty News - What about the next few months? Dominique Bouvier - The general mood was really optimistic at the Cosmoprof tradeshow in Bologna last month. The companies we met have a lot of projects. Maybe there was less visitors, but their quality was better than on the previous years. After some necessary corrections, I think that innovation and quality will allow us to attract consumers again and our industry should be able to get out from the depression faster than others. However, the quality of distribution networks is a key factor of success today. The new European regulation will lead to the creation of new retail channels, in particular regarding dermo-cosmetic products. We'll be attentive to these major evolutions. Premium Beauty News - What about your projects for 2009? Dominique Bouvier - We recently achieved a period of strong industrial investments, and we are now working at the validation of additional quality certifications: in particular the ISO 22176, to complement the ISO 9001, and North America good manufacturing guidelines for OTC drugs. Furthermore, Strand Cosmetics Europe has launched its own environment-friendly policy and all our staff has signed-up the company's sustainable development charter, featuring various measures to reduce our environmental impact, in particular regarding energy and water consumption. We are also about to get the Ecocert certification, which will allow us to widen our range of products and services and to step into the ""green cosmetics"" market. However, we are particularly cautious on the quality of all those new green operators that are contacting us. There is a real demand for transparency and health safety from final consumers, but deceptive claims are the big problem of this dynamic market segment, and companies should be careful about possible backlashes. As far as new technologies are concerned, we have concluded several transversal partnerships this year, with the aim to develop innovative products, in particular in the textile area, and we're also working on new dispersion technologies."
"""Beauty industry professionals, now more than ever, need to meet,"" David Bondi, ITEC France","According to David Bondi, Paris remains a hub for the beauty, cosmetics and spa industries, and Beyond Beauty, which hosts three shows under one single roof [1], offers ""the most profitable concept for opening new markets in France and Europe"". Moreover, ""Beauty industry professionals, now more than ever, need to meet and talk,"" he adds. For the first time this year, Beyond Beauty is leaving the exhibition district of Paris Nord Villepinte and will be held at the exhibition centre of Porte de Versailles, in the very heart of the city. Another news, the Zoom area, which presents a selection of young emerging brands, is being completed with a new space called Beyond Zoom exclusively for niche brands, which are also highly appreciated by buyers. Also, in addition to the Beauty Challenger Awards, a jury of experts will give out the Beauty Organics Awards for the very first time. These awards will recognize the best organic-labelled launches. Furthermore, Beyond Beauty's Spa section has been renamed the European Spa Exhibition & Summit, and aims at taking on another dimension. ""It's an all-new version that's being organized, exclusively created with European spa professionals. With the help of a steering committee made up of important market players like Clarins, Comfort Zone, Decléor, and Lemi among others, we have worked on a set-up that is really adapted to the typology of the sector. The trade show now has a strong identity that's special to the spa world, and everything is done to give priority to business and networking. The Proguidespa.com Hub, exclusively designed for the European Spa Exhibition & Summit, contributes to identifying those with European-level projects and promotes networking with our exhibitors,"" explains Sophie Dudicourt, who's responsible for the project."
Lostmac'h exports Brittany through cosmetics,"After having exported Provence's scents, herbs and traditions worldwide, some French cosmetics makers may have find a new source of inspiration and excellence in Brittany. The westernmost part of the French territory was already the source of a large palette of marine ingredients and of skin and body care products derived from the ranges used in the region's famous thalassotherapy centres. Brands such as Nominoe or Lostmac'h now illustrate the Breizh touch (""Breton touch"") in the high-end cosmetics segment. While Nominoe is betting on the organic and ethic trend, Lostmac'h is positioned in the ""art perfumery"" segment, which was recently showcased at the Exsence tradeshow in Milan. Named after a beach on the Crozon peninsula, ""the last beach of continental Europe"", Lostmac'h proposes an olfactory trip to Brittany, through product ranges evocative of sea scum, heather, and beaches, and featuring Breton names such as Iroaz, Atao, Lann-Ael, Ael Mat, … With 40 points of sale, Italy is the first market of the young brand from Brittany, then come Benelux, France, and the USA. Lostmac'h can also boast being available in about 15 outlets in Australia. Why Brittany? ""Heather, gorse bush, lily, blue thistle, ochre stone, wild colours, heavily fragranced air, sea ciselled stones, sun and fogs … The nature is unforgettable there, with many images, scents and feelings that I tried to capture in fragrance and skincare products. Brittany in this sense is accessible to everybody,"" explains Antoine Vuillermet, the brand's creator. Thus, Antoine Vuillermet gathered Brittany's different faces in three product lines (fragrances, extreme skin care and perfumed candles) that are offered in luxurious packaging, inspired from Brittany's traditional imagery. ""There was nothing so far for celebrating Brittany's treasures, sharing its resources, and offering access to its benefits and pleasures."" Antoine Vuillermet's brands is currently distributed in its own shop in Rennes (the administrative capital of Brittany), and at the Printemps department store in Paris. Another store will open in the Paris' Marais district."
"Luxury goods sales to drop by 10% in 2009, says Bain & Company","Bain & Company has released a semi-annual update to its Luxury Goods Worldwide Market study (7th edition) in response to the sharp deterioration of the global economy since October 2008. ""This year's declines are hitting both the top and bottom lines of luxury goods companies,"" said the study's author Claudia D'Arpizio, a Bain partner and luxury goods expert based in Milan. ""Luxury shoppers are spending less, travelling less and feeling less confident. Luxury goods producers are also feeling the additional squeeze of intense pricing pressure and markdowns from retailers and higher-end department stores."" Bain estimates a 15% decline in the Americas and 10% declines in Europe and Japan. These major luxury markets account for over 80% of worldwide sales. Smaller luxury markets show more promise, with projected growth of 7% in China and 2% in the Middle East, but these gains will provide only a small offset against steep declines in major markets. Among the major luxury product categories, apparel will be hit the hardest, declining by 15%. Jewelry and watches will decline by 12%, while leather goods, shoes and accessories will decline by 10%. Luxury cosmetics and fragrances will be the most resilient categories in 2009 with sales of 22.4 billion euro for cosmetics and 18.4 billion euro for fragrances, both comparable to 2008 levels. Though luxury companies will face increased pressures in 2009, Ms. D'Arpizio cautions them to resist overreacting to anticipated declines. Bain's analysis shows a long-term trend of continued growth in the number of luxury customers with the new segments emerging, including: – newly affluent consumers in emerging markets, especially working women, – men who are more willing to pamper themselves, – younger generations with new tastes and styles, – the increasing number of high net worth individuals (according to Bain's 2009 China Private Wealth Study, the number of Chinese high net worth individuals - those with more than 10 million RMB, or approximately US$1.5 million - is estimated to grow by 6% in 2009)."
Cosmoprof: a lacklustre edition,"The absence of any form of queue on the opening day at the entrance of the Cosmoprof tradeshow (Bologna, Italy) was the most surprising event at Cosmoprof this year. A phenomenon the organisers explain by the online sale of 31,000 tickets, a 63% increase compared to the previous year, representing a third of the total number of tickets sold. Nevertheless, the organisers have announced a 7.5% decrease of the number of visitors compared to the previous year. Eventually, about 140,000 visitors were recorded, including 33,000 non-Italian visitors, the latter falling by a dramatic -14.9% compared to 2008. Regarding the 2,248 exhibitors, including 60% (1,323) non-Italian companies, they enjoyed a huge 91,000 square metres of exhibition surface. From the suppliers' side, the halls 19 and 20 (Cosmopack) were missing several industry leaders such as Rexam, Coster, Seidel, Schwan-Stabilo or Cosmolab, among others… Nevertheless, those who chose to participate in the show have been positively surprised by the number of contacts on their stand. ""Many contacts from Italy, but only very few from the USA, not surprising anyway! Relatively few French, in particular from the most prestigious brands"". Despite the fact that the organisers had invited a delegation of French buyers to attend the show, including a dinner with a selection of exhibitors. This year again, Cosmopack seemed lacking consistency and having difficulties to offer halls fully dedicated to perfumery and cosmetic packaging. Hall 19, in particular, proposed a mix of machinery suppliers, packaging manufacturers, and Asian suppliers of low quality items. Such a lack of consistency does not help to highlight the most innovative offer. However, several exhibitors were displaying interesting new products. MeadWestvaco, for instance, unveiled series of new airless bottles (Aria Airless, Prelude Airless, Pearl Mini Airless) offering various decorative options, which are entirely made in the group's European plants and are available all over Europe. Dieter Bakic Enterprises presented Aqua Lux, a new range of acrylic jars, and several novelties in the double-walled Kronos range, and Pan the company's first airless bottle. As far as perfumes and cosmetics are concerned, the absence of many prestigious and niche brands was notable this year. Niche and art perfumery brands, which are highlighted in the Masterpieces section, where much less numerous this year. The first edition of the Esxence tradeshow, which was held simultaneously in Milan, certainly contributed to this situation. Adding to this dismal display, the decoration of the Masterpieces section, in the hall 30 was particularly poor. From a general point of view, one may question the choice of halls 29 and 30 to host the selective section of he show. In the absence of any appropriate decoration, these two old buildings are a poor shell for high-end products. The organisers have apparently spotted the problem and subsequently announced that the way prestige and high-end cosmetic makers are hosted at Cosmoprof will be entirely reviewed. ""A year and a show that were poor in breakthrough innovations,"" according to Nathalie Dessirier, a trends and lifestyle consultant, co-founder of Cap Beauty. Eventually, the heart of Cosmoprof was beating in the most recent halls 14, 15, 16 and 18, hosting spa and salon brands and equipments."
"""Creativity is Brazil's main asset,"" Joao Carlos Basilio Da Silva","Premium Beauty News - What is the situation of Brazilian cosmetics makers in the current economic context? Joao Carlos Basilio Da Silva - Actually, ABIHPEC's [1] sixth participation in Cosmoprof has been impacted by the economic crisis. We account fewer exhibitors than in 2008 since several Brazilian companies chose to focus their investments on the domestic market and the consolidation of their existing international business. Because of its size and dynamism, the Brazilian cosmetic, toiletry and fragrance market, may be regarded as a good shelter during the international crisis. With an 8.6% share of the world market, according to Euromonitor, Brazil holds the third position in the 2008 ranking, losing only to the United States (15.6%) and Japan (10.1%). Premium Beauty News - What are the main trends of the Brazilian market? Joao Carlos Basilio Da Silva - In contrast to Europe, the Brazilian market is characterized by a preference for long hair. Consequently, the hair care market is the biggest segment in Brazil, and the one where Brazilian companies are the most innovative. According to Euromonitor, Brazil holds on fifth (20.6%) of the world's conditioners market. Premium Beauty News - What about the natural trend? Joao Carlos Basilio Da Silva - Consumers worldwide are increasingly aware of the advantages of maximizing the amount of natural ingredients in cosmetic products. Brazilian consumers also are seeking more natural products. From this point of view, the Brazilian ecosystem and biodiversity is a huge asset for our industry. Indeed, this biodiversity is a fantastic tank of cosmetic actives. Among the 250,000 native botanical species that are known in Brazil, only 300 have been studied for their potential health and beauty properties. Premium Beauty News - What are your main goals on international markets? Joao Carlos Basilio Da Silva - In 2008, Brazilian exports of cosmetics, toiletries and fragrances grew by 20.5%, up to US$ 647.8 million. Brazilian companies exported to 140 countries in 2008, compared to 90 in 1998. As far as Europe is concerned, Brazilian cosmetics makers have settled their strongest positions in Eastern Europe and in Portugal. Even if Brazil's market-share is relatively small in Western Europe, there's no obstacle for growth. Brazilian cosmetics products have a good image, they are well accepted by consumers and their price is attractive for importers and retailers. In the last 10 years, Brazil has recorded a cumulative growth of 357.6% in exports, while imports have grown by 65.6%. Our trade balance turned positive in 2002. In 2008, the surplus totalled US$ 182 million, growing by 11% the previous year. But gaining more ground in the international market continues to be a challenge. Our goal is to become part of the billion dollar exporters club within the next two or three years. Premium Beauty News - Apart from the Amazonian biodiversity, what are the main assets of the Brazilian cosmetics industry? Joao Carlos Basilio Da Silva - Creativity is certainly the most important asset. It helps the Brazilian industry to overcome the technical gap with European and Japanese producers. Brazilian companies have been able to create cosmetic products with an interesting cost-efficiency ratio."
Marketers need to adapt their offer to seniors,"""The ageing of populations globally is an issue that will increasingly shape both society and its consumer markets,"" comments Matthew Adams, Consumer Analyst at Datamonitor and co-author of a new series of reports [1]. Europe is a relatively mature region Consumers aged 50 and above accounts for a large proportion of the population in each European country. This is most apparent in Italy and Germany, where seniors account for more than one third of the overall population (38%) in 2007. In the case of Italy, this proportion should continue to grow as young families break from the historical national norm and have fewer children than previous generations. The Netherlands and the UK were the youngest nations, relatively in Europe in 2007, but the senior population still exceeded one third of the overall population. This should make the Senior consumer particularly worth targeting in terms of potential market size alone. In addition to having the ability to spend, consumers must also show a willingness to spend in order to make them profitable targets. Matthew Taylor, Consumer Market Analyst at Datamonitor, the other author of the reports explains: ""Seniors have many attributes in common with other age groups of consumers against universal criteria such as seeking good value for money."" ""With substantial assets and significant liquid capital, seniors are likely to 'upgrade' and choose premium products, particularly those 'empty nesters' who have less obligation to support the family and children,"" says Taylor. The recent 'less is more' philosophy might reinforce the pursuit of high quality products. The ageing of the Baby Boomers is also a factor in turning toward a less materialistic approach to the luxury lifestyle. With increased consumer awareness of 'sustainability', many products made with natural ingredients cultivated organically, or sourced from specific origins, are becoming popular among these sophisticated consumers. Taylor adds: ""The appeal is not just related to the high quality image of such products; they also carry the signal that they are 'danger-free' and benefit from the natural substances they contain."" However, as far as personal care products are concerned, value-for-money is vital for targeting the seniors, who want a transparent price with clear product benefits. The importance of product efficacy is in doubt though, as only 18.6% of all seniors rated this attribute as a main influence upon product choice. By way of counter-points, almost one half (48.1%) rate 'ease of usage' highly, with more than 40% saying that 'preferred brand' or 'habit' has a high influence on decision to purchase. This attitude implies that few seniors can be easily switched to another brand, other than their preferred one, unless given at least a shot-term price inducement."
Russian market expected to slow down,"The impressive growth of the perfumes and cosmetics market during the previous years (10-15% on average since the mid-1990s, and about 20-25% during the last decade) should slow down to more common rates. According to Russian market research company Symbol-Marketing Agency, a subsidiary of Symbol Communication Group, the growth of perfumes and cosmetics sales should not overcome 10% in 2009 and 2010. Russian customs have recorded a strong decrease of the country's imports of cosmetic products. In January 2009, imports have fallen by 30% compared to the same period last year. The Symbol-Marketing Agency also states that Procter & Gamble's sales in Russia fell by 15%. The decrease of consumers' spending mainly affect premium and luxury segments and are major cities such as Moscow and Saint Petersburg, which are the strongest areas for high-end sales. According to the Symbol-Marketing Agency, these shifts in spending patterns may have a positive impact on the development of local manufacturers such as Kalina and Nevskaya Cosmetics, which may gain market shares"
Emerging economies to drive growth of global cosmetic chemicals market,"Emerging economies such as China, India and Brazil are responding differently to the global economic downturn than developed markets such as Western Europe and the US. Presence of large domestic markets has cushioned these emerging economies from the deepening economic crisis. According to new report by Global Industry Analysts, Inc.: ""the cosmetics and toiletries market in emerging economies is still in its nascent stage, and holds promise for dynamic growth in upcoming years,"" Males are another driver for growth of the cosmetics market. ""Consumption of cosmetics and toiletries is not restricted to the female population alone. Male grooming products have also emerged as an attractive segment. Skin and hair care products, face cleansers, and premium shaving products are proving attractive offerings for the male grooming products market,"" the study reveals. In parallel, cosmetics containing natural and organic ingredients are becoming a rage in European and North American markets. Rising environmental concerns, growing awareness about sustaining resources, carcinogenic nature of synthetic cosmetic ingredients have propelled growth of natural and organic ingredients in cosmetics. According to Global Industry Analysts, the ageing baby boomer population is the dominant consumer group for natural or organic ingredients-based cosmetics. Eventually, the global market for cosmetic chemicals is projected to reach US$19.2 billion by 2015."
The crisis seen from China,"The second edition of Luxe Pack Shanghai (March 17-18, 2009), hosted significantly more visitors than the first one, which is already a success, considering the economic context. However, while the number of exhibitors was also on the rise, most of the ""majors"" of the high-end packaging industry that operate in China were not there. Aptar, Rexam, Alcan, SGD, HCP, Segede, Qualipac, etc. chose not to participate. Eventually, Heinz Glas, through its joint-venture in China, was the only leading manufacturer to exhibit. Premium Beauty News talked to certain of these companies to understand their choice. Indeed, these companies said their market in China is limited to ""the main international perfumery and cosmetic brands"" and there are only few Chinese brands. Eventually, all these customers are met during Cosmoprof Hong Kong or Luxe Pack Monaco. Furthermore, product sourcing companies such as Cosfibel or C. Group, their goal is to address the needs of European and US customers, not Asian ones. So, who was participating in Luxe Pack Shanghai? A lot of designers, of sourcing companies, of resellers in the paper and cardboard industry, a few manufacturers of injected packaging from China or Korea. However it is clear that Shanghai is really the best place in Asia where developing a tradeshow on high-end packaging. Indeed, all the most important customers are located in the area. Luxe Pack will just need more time to grow. After having opened a bureau in China in 2005, Quadpack has signed exclusive partnership agreements with the Jin Sheng company at the beginning of 2008 and, just a few weeks ago, with the Rui Chang company. The main reason behind these agreements is the need, to strengthen the relationship and to carry-on developing new ranges through a limited number of suppliers on the base of Quadpak's quality system. In 2008, Quadack developed more than 70 moulds for its customers and carried on proposing its ""standards"" (500 approved references) also available on its web site: www.quadpack.net While the company just started operations at its new injection plant in China last October (about USD 45 million invested), Jeff Chen, HCP's President and CEO, just announced a new investment program featuring USD 15 million for 2009. The plan includes the opening of a second plant in North America, more precisely in Mexico, next October. There are also several projects in the pipe, in particular a brand new mascara, which is announced as a ""revolution"". ""We became a global company, underlines Jeff Chen. Our turnover, which is split between the USA (32%), Europe (25%) and China (24%), perfectly illustrates this."" Today, HCP in the world can propose 234 injection machines! Diam, a group specialising in the manufacture of displays and other merchandising products, is already present in China (Diam Display China Co. LTD) and is strengthening its position in Asia through the opening of a sales office in Tokyo, Japan. Within a few years, the Aptar group became the unrivalled leader on its segment (dispensing systems) in China. Even if the contribution of the local subsidiary to the group's global turnover remains modest, it enjoys an impressive growth. ""We grew by 31% in 2008 compared to 2007 and probably 20% 'only' in 2009,"" says Thierry Rabu its manager. ""And we obviously still have a heavy investment schedule for the next years, with the aim to become more than twice bigger during the next ten years!"" he adds. Knoll Packaging, a designer and manufacturer of boxes, headquartered in New York (turnover US$ 32 million in 2008) intends to use its new manufacturing facility in China (250 staff), as a springboard to the European market. Jeremy D. Cohen, President and CEO, considers that its Chinese implantation gives him the right assets to interest European cosmetics and perfumes makers."
The recession in three questions,"With a business that dropped ""by 10 to 40 percent, depending on the segments, on the first semester of 2009,"" some operators in the industry may be tempted to go it alone. ""In the present situation, each of us legitimately wants to protect its own margins and therefore wants to pay less for purchases - as it is no longer possible to increase sale prices - and to leave to others the burden of financing growing stocks of unsold items,"" Alain Chevassus explains According to the president of Cosfibel, the current recession raises three important questions. The first question relates to the continuation of business activity. Actually, the adjustment of products' costs is always longer than the drop of sale prices, as everyone is afraid by the ""sales gap"". In such conditions would below-cost selling be acceptable to help maintaining certain activities? ""No,"" answers Alain Chevassus. ""It does not comply with business ethics and there is hardly any interest to see market prices collapsing. Indeed, in such a case, reflation will be more difficult as investments will not be funded by the companies' cash-flow but through their debt."" Precisely, the second question relates to the funding system. ""Bad sales of our customers, as well as ours, are generating new stocks, together with the need to fund them and the need to clear them"". According to Alain Chevassus, ""business ethics would imply that each of us be responsible for funding its own part of the business. Attempts to comply a company to fund another one should be banned, as it would prevent the second company to fund its own investments and would therefore hinder the reflation."" Furthermore, Alain Chevassus also points out the banks' behaviour. While ECB's rates have never been so low (1.5%), rates proposed to SMEs have never been so high (9%). Last but not least, comes the question of how taking into account middle and long term goals. ""The only way to benefit from this crisis is to adapt our behaviour to short term necessities (price adjustments) but also to long term goals: to maintain a mutual trustful relation between customers and suppliers, to carry on investing at the appropriate level, and once again, to stand out from the mass through innovation"". ""We keep on ensuring that the options we choose be consistent with long term goals and contribute to a rapid return to serenity,"" concludesAlain Chevassus."
Australian beauty industry's ambitions,"The Australian cosmetics and toiletries industry has domestic sales of approximately A$ 5 billion (EUR 2.5 billion). Domestic production is estimated to about EUR 400 million for 2008, with a production tool belonging to global cosmetics manufacturers such as Unilever Procter & Gamble and Colgate, but also to several small and medium enterprises such as Jurlique, Bloom, Napoleon Perdis, Ultraceuticals, Nutrimetics and ModelCo. While the country is 14 times bigger than France, Australia counts 20 million inhabitants only. The small size of the market encourages cosmetics makers to conquer abroad markets. One of the main assets helping Australian products to achieve global success in Europe, the USA and in Asia, is their reputation for being clean and green. In terms of exports, the Australian cosmetics and toiletries industry had exports of around A$400 million (EUR 200 million) in 2008, an increase of over 8% on 2007. While the figure remains modest, it is important to consider that exports have been skyrocketing since 2004 when they were estimated at EUR 145 million and the industries are expected continuing strong export growth. Simultaneously, about EUR 550 millions cosmetics and toiletries industry were imported in 2008, growing by 20% over the last four years, the USA and France being the countries first suppliers. Drugstores are the main distribution channel for cosmetics and toiletries in Australia (14% of sales), followed by department stores (12,5%), beauty salons and speciality stores (5%) and duty-free stores. ""High quality French cosmetics brands have an in with the Australian market"", says Sylvie Patinec, from the French trade commission in Sydney. ""From a general point of view, there's a permanent interest for French products. The demand is mostly on innovative products with new ingredients, on natural and organic products, being original and with a good price-quality ratio. Cosmetic products with therapeutic effects, as well as so-called 'holistic' products are trendy too."" According to Patrice Curien [1], General director of Intercos Australia and R.D. Prestige Packaging, ""Consumers of cosmetics and toiletries in Australia are highly interested in high-end products, but there is also a strong demand in the mass market. It is also important to note that all these young Australian brands that were created a few years ago feel they have an in with overseas markets, thanks to the originality of their products and Australia's 'exotic' image. For all these reasons, all forecasts say their market share abroad should be strongly growing"". Maxime Elgue, General Director for the Oceania Area at the DFS group, one of the world's leading travel retailers , is on the same opinion: ""It is true that the Australian market changed a lot during the latest years. Several Australian brands are successful abroad, such as Jurlique, for instance. In parallel, Australian customers travel a lot. For our group, perfumes and cosmetics offer real opportunity for growth"". The impressive raise of Napoleon Perdis, the make-up ""phenomenon"" of the latest years, is perfect illustration of the strong dynamism of young Australian bands. Napoleon Perdis is a self-made man who was born in Sydney. Three years after the opening of its make-up studio in1992, he was launching its own make-up line in its first concept store on Oxford Street. Today, Napoleon Perdis is heading a real little empire. Its brand is distributed through 59 stand-alone concept stores and over 800 point-of-sale locations in Australia and New Zealand. Napoleon Perdis is also stocked at over 300 Ulta stores across the USA. Further, its mass-market line, NP Set, is now available at over 1600 Target stores as well as at 300 Target Australia stores. Another perfect example of Australian fastest growing innovative beauty brand ModelCo. Launched in 2003 by Shelley Barrett, ModelCo immediately got resounding worldwide results with its heated eyelash curler and its tan line products in spray. With a turnover of A$ 15 million last year, a talented staff of 30 people, an astonished distribution network in 1000 stores in 27 countries, the «young» brand using pink colour as a reference and focusing on innovative packaging, has known, thanks to its ambitious manager, how to take benefit of a growing interest for Australian « niche » brands from America (40% of the total sales) and Canada, Asia, Middle East, South Africa and Scandinavia as well. Since, ModelCo has enlarged its cutting-edge creativity to a complete range of makeup products, with eyes and lips key products. « The Australian market itself is essential for us, says Shelley Barrett, as far as we are concerned it has increased by more than 20% between 2007 and 2008 ». Actually, one's just needs to visit a department store in an Australian city there's no shortage of high quality Australian cosmetic brands. Jurlique, Aesop and Napoleon Perdis, of course, but there are also: Natio, Bloom, Inessence, Sugar Baby, Mor, Invisible Zinc, Chi Chi…"
"""A product must speak to the consumer"", Napoleon Perdis","Napoleon launched a small makeup studio in the Sydney suburb of Leichhardt in 1992. In 1993, he opened the Napoleon Perdis Makeup Academy, which currently has eight campuses across Australia and New Zealand and one on Hollywood Boulevard in California. Two years later he debuted his first concept store on Sydney's Oxford Street, boasting a full cosmetics collection, including foundations, eye shadows, lipsticks and accessories. Vivid, vivacious colour soon became a Napoleon Perdis trademark. Innovative designs, amazing products, freshness and energy, as well as staff training and education also contributed to the success of the brand. ""A product must speak to the consumer,"" he says. ""He must be consistent with its claims"". Today Napoleon Perdis has 59 stand-alone concept stores and over 800 point-of-sale locations in Australia and New Zealand. In the United States, the brand has four Napoleon Perdis concept stores, including the vibrant flagship on Hollywood Boulevard, and is stocked at over 300 Ulta stores across the country, as well as at select independent retailers nationwide. When Target's executives approached Napoleon to launch a second cosmetics line in the mass-market channel, he did not hesitate a while. The resulting collection, NP Set, was launched in 2008 and is now available at over 1600 Target stores in the US as well as at 300 Target Australia stores. The collection is 98% paraben-free and boasts organic benefits. Napoleon is now looking at several foreign markets where to extend its young and successful empire. South America comes first in the list, Brazil in particular, which is ""the fourth world's largest market for cosmetics and toiletries"", then Mexico and South East Asia. ""Europe is not a priority so far, it will come next but there's no hurry"". According to Napoleon, being an Australian brand is neither a strength nor a weakness. ""I was born in Australia from Greek parents. This mix of European classicism and Australian nature is likely to have helped developping my own creativity. But I am not selling Australia, I'm selling Napoleon Perdris""."
"In 2009, Cosmoprof announces its R-Evolution","Premium Beauty News - 2009 is likely to be a difficult year for the industry. What will be the impact of the crisis on the next edition of Cosmoprof in April? Aureliana de Sanctis - Our analysis is that buyers will have to make choices in order to reduce the number of tradeshows they will visit, and they will favour exhibitions where they can see the most important number of new products. Exhibitors should also make similar choices. Eventually, the situation may be very profitable for a leading trade show such as Cosmoprof. So far, we can observe that both middle size and big companies have asked for larger stands, probably after a new market analysis. Companies are reducing their budget but focus their resources on tradeshows that provide the best answers to their development strategy. And the Cosmoprof Worldwide show [1] in Bologna is one of them. Premium Beauty News - Under your supervision, the next Cosmoprof will carry on its evolution. Apparently, you made the choice of a ""retail"", rather than industrial, positioning. Aureliana de Sanctis - Cosmoprof is evolving toward the creation of synergies between the production and the distribution. This year Cosmoprof will propose ""focus on"", BtoB meetings and conferences about the affective value of design, the creation of fragrances, the use of paper and the services for spa venues. More than ever, the final consumer has an increased influence on every sector of the beauty industry. Premium Beauty News - There are now two additional exhibition halls. How did you re-organised the showfloor? Aureliana de Sanctis - One of the main changes at Cosmoprof this year is the reorganisation of the different industry sectors. We are aware that these choices are not always understood by exhibitors, but they are required by the evolution of the show. The aim is to bring a better legibility to professional visitors. A show is like a ""big city to live in"" during 4-5 days and our philosophy is to make our best to facilitate and simplify the visit of our exhibitors' potential customers. Premium Beauty News - Regarding the ""packaging"" and ""full s ervice"" sections (Cosmopack), how do you intend to highlight it? Aureliana de Sanctis - The packaging and OEM sections will benefit from their opening one-day before the rest of the show, so that professional visitors can focus on this specific segment. Exhibitors in the packaging have been appreciating this separate opening for several years. On this occasion, Cosmoprof 2009 will offer dedicated events, featuring an internationl conference on the sector and the visit of a ""Packaging Buyers Delegation"" which will meet exhibitors of Halls 19 and 20. Furthermore, our specific attention to this sector does not end with the show as we are organising ""Business or Dinner"" events all along the year in Paris or Hong Kong during which leading packaging companies are meeting decision-making staff from luxury and mass-market brands, with the aim to exchange on issues of specific interest. Premium Beauty News - What is the future of tradeshow? Aureliana de Sanctis - Tradeshows can no longer limit themselves to showcasing products. They must transform in forerunning and visionary events, in true laboratories where future trends are highlighted and where groundbreaking success stories are analysed. Cosmoff Lab, the brand new event of this edition, was precisely conceived with this aim: a real beauty laboratory where people can seize the opportunity to meet and exchange."
"""Colour cosmetics tend to resist economic downturns,"" Thomas Weckerle","Premium Beauty News - The development of the slide-up button tubes for lipsticks is often presented as a technical revolution. Could you explain why Thomas Weckerle - On the one hand, this development was a true challenge to Weckerle Machines, whereby we needed to adapt to new trends on the packaging side to create an industrial process related to the new way the packaging was conceived. By adjusting tools and modifying existing equipment, we quickly addressed this challenge. On the other hand, such an innovative process is part of every project we handle. From our point of view, every single project owns its part of innovation and R&D challenges; there is hardly any project without innovation. That's the reason why we constantly carry on improving our development processes. This project shows how much Weckerle Machines' equipment is adapted to innovation. New Weckerle machines are always made considering that enough flexibility is needed to make possible the development of innovative products. Premium Beauty News - After the launch of airtight tubes for lipsticks did you continue to develop this technique? What kind of improvements were required? Thomas Weckerle - Airtight components are more and more important due to the fact that we have been moving away from the regular wax and oil formulations. At Weckerle we are constantly improving our processes in all areas particularly packaging, formulations and production process design. This in order to create innovative concepts which don't look at a single dimension, namely packaging, but also in all the areas involved to make a cosmetics product. Premium Beauty News - What proportion of your investments does the lipsticks sector represent? Thomas Weckerle - It is extremely difficult allocate a figure to the development of lipsticks. As I mentioned before, every project implies an R&D challenge and therefore it is difficult measure investments into a specific sector. We are constantly investing into innovation. Premium Beauty News - So, what about your turnover? Thomas Weckerle - Lipsticks represent around 40% of our turnover. Premium Beauty News - Do you think the sector will suffer from the economic climate? Thomas Weckerle - We doubt about it. Colour cosmetic products tend to be resistant to economic downturns. Just asking a simple question may help to make the demonstration: ""will your wife stop buying a lipstick just because of an economic downturn?"" Make-up products have turned to be a commodity for consumers and hopefully the impact on an economic slow down is minimum. In addition, we are very active in the mass-market sector and we believe that this particular sector could even benefit from an economic downturn. Premium Beauty News - And the alleged competition between lipsticks and the glosses? Thomas Weckerle - During a couple of years, at the beginning of the decade, there has been a shift in the business from lipsticks to lip glosses but eventually the market realized that both products complement each other and in certain concepts they even work together. Also there have been new developments in formulation on both sides as well as the development of filling techniques such as the centre core for lipstick, which has brought a different dynamic to both concepts. The bottom line here is that what we can achieve with a lip gloss we can't achieve it with a lipstick and inversely, this is a challenge for us and we liked to be challenged! Premium Beauty News - Concerning the evolutions of European and foreign markets? Thomas Weckerle - Eastern Europe has become a key market for lipsticks and for the cosmetics industry in general. Actually, it is increasingly necessary to a have good knowledge of local markets in order to have a better understanding of their specific needs and to develop concepts that are relevant to today's global trends while addressing local demands. Particularly in growing markets such as Latin America, Eastern Europe and China."
Lipsticks: a safe bet,"It's not so easy to make a symbol evolve! That's probably the reason why, as far as lipsticks are concerned, brands remain cautious about innovation. However, their suppliers seem have several original projects ""in the pipe"". As far as the lipstick primary packaging (the tube) is concerned, British packaging group Rexam is the uncontested leader. Its strong position was built and consolidated during the 1990s, in particular with the acquisitions of the French company Reboul, and of the giant Chinese packaging maker, Derkwey. ""Today, our strength lies in our industrial presence worldwide (Europe, USA, Asia, South America) that we have consolidated through the creation of a global platform for our mechanisms,"" explains Pierre Marand, Make Up Business Unit Director at Rexam. However, Rexam's current strength also lies in the group's research and development capabilities. ""There are still huge innovation opportunities in this segment, and that's exactly what we demonstrated with the surface coating we applied on Dior's High Shine tubes,"" says Pierre Marand. Additional steps forward, in particular in the field of finishing, are likely to come soon. ""Packaging innovation on the segment remains challenging since traditional gestures linked to the product use have become almost natural to most women. But it's also a real opportunity for us. We have always been working hard on these issues, and this year will bring the opportunity to communicate about that,"" Pierre Marand adds. According to Jacques Cohen, president of Axilone USA: ""It is clear that state-of-the-art technologies and processes regarding metal and plastic transformation and finishing focus on lipstick tubes. This aim is to produce a beautiful object, which brings women the functionalities they're expecting, while protecting formulations. Therefore, it is necessary to perfectly handle a variety of manufacturing processes and technologies. As far as finishing is concerned, it is required to be the best in all technical areas."" From this point of view, the latest lipstick Axilone developed for MAC is an epitome of this ability to handle a multiplicity of state-of-the-art technologies. The product required lacquering, hot stamping and many other technologies, in addition to the manufacture and assembly of plastic and metal components. For packaging producers, the capacity to supply global customers is a key factor of success today. For Alcan Packaging Beauty, it has been one of the main axes of its strategy since 2006, as it has been for Rexam. ""For each geographical area, Europe, Americas, Asia, we'll be able to supply this kind of service to our major customers,"" explains Stéphane Tondenier, Alcan's Vice-President Sales & Marketing Fragrance & Cosmetics Worldwide. Alcan aims to become one of the three leading companies on this segment in 2009. ""We have multiplied our efforts in order to reach this goal,"" Stéphane Tondenier underlines. ""All or factories will be able to offer multiple injection and finishing technologies, using our industrial presence worldwide where the know-how accumulated for several years in the perfumery, skincare and cosmetic segments is one of main assets."" Thanks to this strategy, Alcan is currently involved in eight major global launches. ""We expect to double our lipsticks sales in 2009 compared to 2008,"" says Stéphane Tondenier. ""It is clear that the competition is mainly about decoration and finishing,"" he comments. Of course, the capacity to produce globally is not the only factor of success. Besides companies such as Rexam, Risdon, Axilone, HCP, Shia Shin and Alcan, there are other operators are playing their cards right. For instance, the German packaging manufacturer Oekametall holds ""four main assets"" according to its CEO, Gerald Oehlhorn: ""a well tested mechanism, with no lubricant of course; a fully integrated manufacturing process featuring the injection, the finishing and assembling; being a family owned company with a rapid decision-making process; and being a German company that was able to adapt itself to international constraints and other cultures."" On the other hand, Stéphane Tondenier is much more cautious about ""mechanical"" innovations and possible evolutions of traditional gestures linked to the use of lipsticks! ""Of course, we have several solutions in stock, but lipsticks remain a very traditional object, and major changes are unlikely to happen, even if new attempts were recently launched on the market,"" he says. At Texen's, innovation is centred on the industrial process. ""We have developed a patented mechanism, that allows us to remove one piece from the process compared to our competitors,"" says Georges Lachas, sales director. But this does not prevent the company to explore alternative solutions for its products. ""Our main evolutions are oriented towards possibilities of double-headed products,"" he adds. For Eric Bigotte, Risdon (40% of the turnover made with lipstick tubes): ""As far as we are concerned, innovation consisted in the launch of a 'one handed' mechanism, illustrated by Avon's 'Pro to Go'. Risdon is the inventor and holds the patent of the slide-up button tube, and we are developing a gloss and a mascara with the same technology"". However, according to Jacques Cohen, Axilone USA, if the one-handed lipstick tube is really an interesting idea, it is unlikely to develop further. ""There are obvious marketing arguments, but our customers usually do not mention this characteristic in their specifications for new developments."" Same analysis by Georges Lachas, Texen: ""The one-handed model developed for Chanel seems to be a success, but so far, other illustrations are limited to lip protection and lip care, and apart from Chanel it's hard to find any make-up product using it."" ""Lipstick is a different product within the cosmetics and make-up categories,"" explains Jacques Cohen, Axilone USA. For many women, it's an accessible luxury that will last. ""In the USA, lipstick retail prices are usually less than 20 dollars, even for prestigious brands, allowing women to use several shades. And the price is not yet expensive enough for preventing women to indulge themselves with these products"". An opinion that is shared by Florence Robilliart, Intercos: ""We think that make-up, as a whole, will be less impacted than other beauty segments. Lipstick in particular remains unavoidable within women's daily make-up routine"". Eric Bigotte, Risdon, is more cautious: ""Lipstick will be impacted by the current economic situation because consumers are increasing lost within a huge offer, as they are with fragrances. However, it's true that lipstick tubes are increasingly assimilated to jewellery, matching with particular social status and with a high sensitivity to fashion. I would not be surprised if celebrity lipstick and make-up lines would appear on the market."" And what about the impact of gloss products? According to George Lachas, the question does not really need to be debated. ""Gloss products have certainly conquered some market shares to the detriment of lipsticks, but global sales volumes clearly exceed the initial volume of lipsticks alone. Gloss products gained market shares, in particular with women of less than 30 years, but remain complementary to the use of a lipstick. Gloss users did not give up lipstick, its more a matter of diversification than a substitution""."
France: beauty sales slow down in 2008,"Sales of perfumes and cosmetics in specialised retail chains, independent shops, and supermarkets increased by 2.5% to 6.56 billion euros in 2008; a strong slowdown compared to 2007 (+4%) or 2006 (+5%). Actually, French consumers did not really increase their purchases of cosmetic products in 2008 compared to the previous year. As far as volumes are concerned, sales grew by less than 1%. Indeed, the market growth is mainly due to price increases in this sector in 2008. According to Precepta, the slowdown should continue in 2009. Growth in value would be less than 1.5%, while the firm considers that the second semester will be more dynamic."
A salutary crisis?,"So… is it the big one crisis or just a severe slowdown? ""There's no doubt, the market is really bad,"" comments the manager of a big brands marketer. But the development manager of one of its competitors suggests a very different outlook. ""So far the market remains stable, and at a quite good level,"" he says. ""Should we compare this crisis to periods of strong slowdown, such as 2001 or 2002, the impact on the economy should not be exaggerated,"" states the manager of a European glassmaker. ""However, it's true that our order backlog is at a low level (two months) and that the rhythm of new orders has been particularly low since the beginning of the year"". ""As far as I am concerned, the few contacts I had with big customers, such as Britain-based Body Shop, for instance, do not lead me to pessimism, on the very contrary,"" explains the sales director of a manufacturer of airless designs. ""We have a significant number of new developments in our pipes, we do not really perceive any slowdown yet,"" confirms the boss of a French plastic injection firm. Cardboards: the great purge The cardboard industry is probably one the more rapidly and harshly impacted. However, ""the rot had already set in"" explains an industry insider. ""Too many factories, too many big machines, excessive production capabilities, and a short-term vision from most of the big paper and cardboard manufacturers,"" comments the same expert. Numerous closures of cardboard factories in Northern Europe are leading to an unprecedented drop of production capacities. Actually, the demand dramatically decreased in some sectors. However, several cardboard and paper producers told Premium Beauty News that the perfumery and cosmetics businesses remain healthy, while the pharmaceuticals market is even more dynamic. Broadly speaking, cardboard producers share the opinion that it was necessary to reduce production capacities. Eventually, this purge appears as much needed but it has painful and largely unpredictable consequences. Should we believe most of the beauty insiders we interviewed: 2009 will be an extremely harsh year and many producers will meet severe difficulties, and several closures are expected. Hopefully, they say, the price of raw materials dramatically decreased! So, how to cope with the crisis? Some interviewees recommend to ""focus on niches"" or to ""preserve margins"". Others are on the opinion that ""innovation"" is the only way out. A latter strategy that some brands have been implementing for several years: with some success considering their relatively good results on the fourth quarter of 2008. Apparently, they do not intend to slowdown the path of their new developments. A very good idea, according to their suppliers!"
Cosmetic food: Danone to end Essensis sales in France,"A Danone France spokeswoman confirmed to Agence France Presse the information published on the website of specialised weekly magazine LSA: sales of the whole Essensis range, the first beautifying yoghurt to be marketed in France, will end on March 1, 2009. Launched in February 2007, Essensis did not meet the success the group expected. Despite strong initial sales, volumes rapidly dropped. Danone even had to develop new flavours after market feedbacks pointed out excessive sugar sweetness. However, price appears as the key factor to explain the failure. Marketed as a premium product, Essensis was more expensive than other yoghurts. Furthermore, daily consumption was recommended for visible effects on the skin. The stoppage of Essensis sales would be consistent with Danone's intention to concentrate on its key brands. However, the skincare yoghurt should remain available in other countries, such as Spain and Italy."
Purchasing behaviour in prestige chain stores,"The study was conducted during June 2008 into 40 outlets of the main prestige beauty chain stores in Paris: Marionnaud, Sephora and Nocibé. A total of 1628 persons participated in the survey and answered questions about their purchasing habits, from the outlet's choice to the main reasons to buy. According to the NPD's study, prestige beauty chain stores have loyal customers (90% are women): 2/3 of them only buy their scented, skincare and make-up products in prestige outlets. When questioned, 60% of participants in the study said they were in the outlet they are used to visit and where they have their habits. Eventually, 80% of them hold to the chain's fidelity program, and half of them also adhere to another selective beauty chain's program, including department stores. The study reveals that service is an important reason to opt for the prestige retail channel. 60% said it was one of the reasons to chose the chain. The other main reason for coming in a prestige beauty outlet (50%) is the large product choice brands and products available. 85% of the respondents said their purchased was decided and balanced long before the come. A large majority of consumers say they exactly know what they are looking for: 40% say they intend to buy several products, and 66% state they came into the store with a specified brand in mind. The proportion of impulsive purchases therefore remains minor, but depends on market segments (22% of impulsive purchases for make-up, 14% for skincare and 11% for fragrances). ""Eventually, half of consumers leave the outlet with the product(s) they say to be loyal to or that they already bought or used in the past,"" the NPD Group explains in a release. Concerning their budget, consumers say they expect to spend an average 63 euros and 60% of them say the are leaving the outlet with one product only, as per their purchasing intentions."
Crisis-shaped consumer trends,"The fourth quarter of 2008 confirmed that the U.S.A. and several European economies have entered into recession, but Nathalie Dessirier warns: ""as far as cosmetics are concerned, one should be careful not to be misled by the wrong crisis"". For the cosmetics industry, the credit crunch might not be the main danger. Consumers' declining of confidence towards products loosing their symbolic value may have deeper consequences. ""From this point of view, addressing sustainable development issues should remain a priority"", Nathalie Dessirier explains. Actually, mainstream cosmetic products are really distrusted by many consumers. Consequences are well known: growth of the natural and organic beauty markets, needs for enhanced information regarding ingredients and their origin. The divergent evolution of world's markets is the other key factor that helps understanding the shift in consumer needs and trends. On the one hand a new upper class of affluent consumers is growing in emerging countries, and, on the other hand, the working and middle classes are facing increased precarity, including in developed countries. According to Nathalie Dessirier, the main trends to come can already be identified: ""Consumers are turning inwards, in need of reassurance, looking to purchase less but better… They want to make their own and personal choices, and will have to decide what to buy and what budget to spend. However, consumers will still like to indulge themselves (hopefully), when there are opportunities."" Considering this picture, the cosmetics industry's interest seems to keep consumers in mind: ""to get back to marketing basics, to understand consumers' needs and to assist them during the purchase"". Which in the current context means ""to adopt an ethical and sustainable behaviour, and to be transparent regarding products' features, as today's consumers are increasingly suspicious,"" explains Cap Beauty co-founder. Of course, it remains necessary to make consumers dreaming and to boost retail sales but it becomes important to avoid the vicious circle of launches… Actually, ""get back to pragmatic and time-resistant innovations, inspired from other cultures"". Many current advertising campaigns highlighting eco-responsibility, authenticity, transparency and service offers plainly demonstrate that some operators have already switched to this new model. Coty's launch of a personalised e-coaching programme for Home Skin Lab, and Olay's offer of a personalised beauty consultations are illustrative of the increased individualisation of services… As far as eco-responsibility is concerned, Aveda's ""100% wind power"" campaign is the epitome of the sort. Commitments to information, education and transparency are well illustrated by Burt's Bees' informative messages regarding cosmetic ingredients, or Yves Rocher's new Culture Bio organic range. Eventually, the best achievement of real-life marketing is certainly Dove's campaign for real beauty. ""In the meantime, beauty must remain a dreamful industry and must carry on creating emotional relationships with consumers"" Nathalie Dessirier insists. Consumers do love paradoxes! Especially when they simultaneously are affluent Indians eager to enjoy a luxury Western lifestyle and tight-budget European employees. However, dream enhancement initiatives in other industries may be instructive. Nespresso, for instance, successfully marketed a mass consumption good as a luxury product. There are similar achievements in the beauty industry. Serge Lutens, for instance, who welcome its customer in a private parlour where the brand's make up line is presented and explained. ""A crisis is a breakthrough period from which new opportunities (such as the e-commerce), new markets (such as organic cosmetics) or technical innovations can emerge. But in order to be audacious and innovative, listening consumers is important, such as developing a better market knowledge and being curious about everything happens, in particular on side markets,"" Nathalie Dessirier concludes."
"""Consumer's power is going to increase,"" Joël Palix, Clarins","Premium Beauty News - What have been the innovation landmarks of 2008 regarding the fragrance business within the Clarins group? Joël Palix - The two main events for Clarins Fragrance Group in 2008 were the launch of Parfums Corps, Angel's new bath line, and the launch of the Porsche Design fragrance. The Parfums Corps line is a true innovation, regarding both the formula and the packaging, it's a real breakthrough on the fragrance. You know how difficult it is to address such a challenge on that saturated market. We're making a bold statement. This story started from the very simple idea of creating a new generation of fragrances that would materialize into various textures. We invented a line of perfumes for the body that we named Les Parfums Corps, it's a real breakthrough compared to the perfumed bath lines currently available on the market. As per the formula, the molecular system IDS, for Intense Diffusion System ®, is a brand new technology developed in exclusivity with Givaudan's perfumers, which can inflect the olfactory behavior of Angel to enhance its power. Regarding The Essence by Porsche Design, the main challenge was to comply with the stringent ""German-like"" specifications stipulated by the brand owner. On the one hand, we had to place the entire spray cap (a 7 piece mechanism) into a very small space, and, on the other hand, we had to combine metal and glass, two prestigious materials but with opposite characteristics. Both the technical and the aesthetics challenges were addressed through the active cooperation between our suppliers I'pack, Pochet, Qualipac and the Clarins Fragrance Group's Development division. Premium Beauty News - Forecasts for the year 2009 are not very optimistic. Within such a context, what is your message to the supply side? Joël Palix - My message is to remain confident. The crisis is similar to the speculative bubble, it is bound to come to an end, and our job implies to think and act in the long run. It's within a storm that good sailors demonstrate their qualities. We must carry on cooperating together and we must prepare the future with the aim to increase consumers' satisfaction. The power of consumers is going to increase further. They will separate the wheat from the chaff. For instance, it is therefore useless to deceive them with a lowered quality. Through its brands, Clarins Fragrance Group, has built strong relationships with suppliers, and we'll take care to preserve these links despite the dull economic context. Premium Beauty News - And what about the Clarins group itself? Joël Palix - Our group left the stock exchange just before the crisis, thus gaining the possibility to enter into the current economic environment with a broader view, if not full serenity. Clearly, we are now focusing on profitability rather that on an artificial and non-sustainable conquest of market shares. Such circumstances may lead us to delay certain new launches or investments for the benefit of our core brands that have the chance of being well established worldwide, our women's lines with Thierry Mugler (Angel, Alien) on equal footing with our men's lines with Azzaro (Azzaro pour homme, Chrome). Premium Beauty News - Does the current volatility of raw material markets affect your business? Joël Palix - Actually, current times are not easy times for forecasts, mainly because of erratic modifications in consumer trends, and storage surplus policies, and because of the way the different market operators, particularly retailers, are managing their cash flows. The volatility of raw materials is just another difficulty, but as far as the fragrance business is concerned this factor has a mild impact and I do not think it is a major impediment. However, supply shortages of some raw materials and the subsequent speculation, I am thinking about patchouli for instance, have a strong impact because they prevent us to safely organize our production. In partnership with our concerned suppliers, we are testing the development of some raw materials in new areas, such as Rwanda for patchouli. Results are encouraging and at the same time they allow us to support the development of sustainable local economies, something that perfectly matches the goals of the Clarins group. Premium Beauty News - Owners of luxury brands are apparently modifying their supply policy with regard to ""full service"". Is it the case of your company and what kind of products is concerned? Joël Palix - We keep on relying on a classical scheme and do not outsource a too important part of the product's development. Indeed we consider this job as an assurance for quality and originality. Similarly, we rely on a large choice of perfume creators, as we do not want our brands to be confined in a small olfactory style. Once again, I'm convinced that Clarins Fragrance Group must carry on with the original and, sometimes against the flow, choices that made our previous successes."
Interbrand launches top list of leading luxury brands,"In The Leading Luxury Brands 2008, its premiere study of the world's leading luxury brands, Interbrand, a global branding consultancy agency, examines how brands in the complex luxury sector are building brand value. According to the company, the ability of these brands to be resilient to economic crises could not prove true this time. ""Until recently it seemed that luxury brands remained stable through economic downturns. However, it is clear today, as we plunge forward into the challenges of global recession that no industry will remain insulated,"" said Jez Frampton, Group Chief Executive of Interbrand. ""Luxury's success at expanding its markets during the recent times of prosperity have left the sector more vulnerable today. And yet, there remains a tier of pure luxury brands that minimize risk and generate long-term value,"" Frampton added. Interbrand's study identifies the top 15 global leading luxury brands by financial brand value, and taps into the management trends that define their achievements in standing the tests of time. The study identifies that while leading luxury brands offer important lessons to others and are likely to fare better than most in the uncertain economic times ahead, the markets are proving to be unpredictable. ""The social implications of this economic upheaval may forever alter the luxury market's affluent consumer. The consistency with which leading luxury brands have managed themselves suggests that a 'business as usual' attitude in the uncertain times ahead will not be enough. As the excesses of earlier days disappear, constant determination, conviction and creativity will be a must,"" said Jean-Baptiste Danet, Interbrand's European CEO and a recognized leader in luxury branding."
Microplastics: How the EU plans to reduce pollution by 30% by 2030,"The European Union has launched an ambitious plan to reduce pollution linked to microplastics. The aim is to reduce releases into the environment by 30% by 2030. Ultimately, the new rules [1] will prohibit the sale of microplastics as such, and of products to which microplastics have been added on purpose and that release those microplastics when used. According to the European Commission, this will prevent the release to the environment of about half a million tonnes of microplastics. Microplastics are defined as synthetic polymer particles below five millimetres that are organic, insoluble and resist degradation. The first measures, for example the ban on plastic-based loose glitter and microbeads added to cosmetic formulations, have entered into force on October 17, 2023. In other cases, the sales ban will apply after a longer period (up to 12 years for some cosmetic products) to give affected stakeholders the time to develop and switch to alternatives. The immediate ban on loose glitter, mainly made of plastic and aluminium, but also on microbeads which are used in the composition of cosmetic products such as scrubs, is justified by the immediate availability of usable alternatives. In addition, the European Commission announced other proposals on Monday October 16, this time targeting plastic pellets. The proposed regulation includes compulsory best handling practices for operators, mandatory certification and self-declarations, a harmonised methodology to estimate losses, with lighter requirements for SMEs. In practice, companies will have to conduct risk assessments to ensure their operations are taking the right measures to avoid spillage. If there is spillage, they will have to act quickly to contain leaks and undertake cleaning operations if necessary. The proposed text will now be discussed by the European Parliament and the Council. According to the institution, between 52 and 184 thousand tonnes of pellets are released in the environment each year due to mishandling throughout the entire supply chain. The commission hopes the proposal will reduce pellet release by up to 74 percent. ""Microplastics are pervasive and we need to stop the pollution at the source,"" the EU's environment commissioner Virginijus Sinkevicius said. Persistent, very mobile, and hard to remove from nature, microplastics have been found all over the world, even in the most remote locations, and in the human body. The risks related to high levels of human exposure are a cause of grave concern."
French industry speaks up for octocrylene as health agency calls for a ban,"The French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health Safety (ANSES) is calling for a ban on octocrylene in sunscreen products. The information revealed at the end of last week by French media has been confirmed by the Agency. Octocrylene is commonly used as a UV filter to protect the skin from the harmful effects of sunlight. In recent years, however, this substance has been criticized for its effects on the environment. In coral, octocrylene has been shown to accumulate in the form of fatty acid conjugates and trigger mitochondrial dysfunction [1]. A 2021 study also pointed to its degradation into benzophenone over time in tested commercial products. In its latest opinion from 2021, the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) considered the use of this filter to be safe in sunscreen products at a maximum concentration of 10%. However, the committee's analysis did not cover the environmental aspect which is the base of the French health agency's request for a ban. According to the Agency, banning this filter would be the only option to reduce its presence in the environment and its harmful effects on the ecosystems. However, while it was sent on May 26 to the French Ministry of Ecological Transition, the recommendation was not forwarded to European authorities, an unusual situation. As far as it is concerned, the Ministry denied any attempt to block the process. France should therefore suggest its European partners to review all possible options regarding the safety of the substance. The French Federation of Beauty Enterprises (FEBEA) quickly reacted by stressing that the safety of octocrylene has been duly assessed by the SCCS in the 2021 decision. Regarding the impact of the substance on the environment, the FEBEA considers this allegation ""is not supported by robust methods"" and there is a lack of scientific consensus on the issue. ""Coral reef bleaching is mainly due to rising ocean temperatures linked to global warming, followed by other recognized factors such as overfishing,"" said the cosmetics industry advocacy group. In order to have a better view on the issue, the cosmetics industry is working within the International Collaboration on Cosmetics Safety (ICCS) to develop a standardized calculation model for the exposure of the marine environment to sunscreens. Once developed, the method will be made available to all stakeholders, including: cosmetic brands, public or private research organizations, and agencies. The model is expected be finalized by the end of 2023."
Canada joins countries banning cosmetic animal testing,"With the passing of Bill C-47, Budget Implementation Act, 2023, No. 1, the Canadian Parliament has amended the Food and Drugs Act (FDA) to ban cosmetic animal testing. The new legislative changes mean that in Canada, companies will no longer be allowed to test cosmetic products on animals or sell their cosmetics that rely on animal testing data to establish safety. The text received Royal Assent on June 22, 2023, with a coming into force six months later, on December 22, 2023. According to Health Canada, the practice of testing cosmetics on animals was rarely conducted in Canada. However, by implementing this ban, the country is aligning with the global shift toward animal welfare and is joining a large number of countries that have already taken such measures, including all European Union countries, Australia, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea. The new legislation states that: ""No person shall sell a cosmetic unless the person can establish the safety of the cosmetic without relying on data derived from a test conducted on an animal that could cause pain, suffering or injury, whether physical or mental, to the animal."" Some exceptions are listed, in particular when ""the test was necessary to meet the requirement in order to sell the product in that country."" ""Industry and animal protection advocates have worked together over the last several years to advance a cosmetics animal testing ban in Canada. Since this issue was first raised in Parliament through a Private Member's Bill in the Senate in 2015, our group has met frequently to build a collaborative relationship and to align on the principles with Health Canada while ensuring the ban works within the Canadian regulatory framework. We are very pleased to see the government pass this long overdue legislation,"" said Darren Praznik, President and CEO of Cosmetics Alliance Canada. ""Cruelty Free International applauds the Canadian Government for taking action to fulfil the wishes of the vast majority of Canadian citizens who supported a ban on animal testing for cosmetics. This has been a unifying issue that has earned cross-party support in Canada and will match the progress we are seeing around the world as consumers, companies, regulators and advocates come together to achieve a common goal of ensuring that animals won't suffer for the sake of cosmetics anywhere,"" also said Monica Engebretson, Head of Public Affairs North America, Cruelty Free International."
"""Industry is not looking for loopholes,"" says CTPA about ban on animal testing","The whole situation results from two decisions by the Board of Appeal of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) [1] in August 2020, requiring German chemicals manufacturer Symrise to carry out several toxicity tests on animals on two chemical UV filters (homosalate and 2-ethylhexyl salicylate), used exclusively in sunscreen formulations, to fulfil 'tick-box' registration requirements for worker safety under the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation. In the wake of the ruling, key players from the cosmetics industry, including Avon, L'Oréal, Procter & Gamble, Unilever and Lush, have joined forces with Humane Society International to oppose a decision that would undermine ""the EU's animal testing ban success story."" A joint campaign was even launched in 2021, calling on European citizens to mobilize against ECHA's decisions. To clarify the legal situation in the United Kingdom, Cruelty Free International brought the case before the High Court of Justice saying the British government had not communicated clearly on the fact that it had aligned with ECHA's Boar of Appeal ruling. In a judicial review of the Home Office's policy on animal testing, the High Court dismissed the complaint and confirmed that in some case, chemicals used in cosmetics may be tested on animals as a last resort, to prove their safety for workers or the environment for the purposes of the REACH regulation on chemicals. This has been interpreted by Cruelty Free International as the proof that the government had abandoned the ban. ""This is absolutely not the case,"" said Dr Emma Meredith, Director-General of CTPA. ""Animal testing on cosmetic products has been banned in the UK since the late 1990s and these strict bans remain in place and will continue to be a key part of the UK cosmetics law, whether or not a product makes a 'not tested on animals' or 'cruelty-free' claim."" Indeed, CTPA considers the UK High Court ruling does not override the Cosmetics Regulation bans on animal testing. The association has sought reassurance from the Home Office, and said a Government spokesperson confirmed: ""There has been no change in our legislation and the ban on using animals for the testing of finished cosmetic products remains in force."" Actually, the regulatory dilemmas are basically the same in the UK and within the European Union. Both the UK Cosmetics Regulation and the EU Cosmetic Products Regulation ban animal testing of cosmetic products and their ingredients. However, the ingredients in cosmetics are also subject to other chemical safety laws, including the REACH Regulation, which sometimes requires substances to be tested on animals, in particular to ensure the safety of workers who might be exposed to chemicals, and the environment. That was the meaning of ECHA's 2020 rulings. Cruelty Free International considers that ECHA's and the UK High Court's interpretation of the legislation is creating loopholes and that the stringent bans on animal are finally abandoned. Therefore, the NGO is now seeking permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal against the judge's ruling. Commenting on the decision, Cruelty Free International stressed the judge also said that there was nothing to prevent the Government from reinstating the policy ban. ""The Government does not have to slavishly follow legislation coming from the EU. It should do what the overwhelming majority of British people want,"" said the animal rights advocacy group. ""The UK Cosmetics Regulation is clear in specifying that in order to meet its requirements cosmetic products may not be placed on the UK market if the final formulation, ingredients in a final formulation, or a finished product have been subject to animal testing if the purpose of the tests was compliance with the UK cosmetics laws, no matter where such tests took place. There are no loopholes and the cosmetics industry is not seeking to circumvent these important bans,"" commented CTPA in a statement."
EU REACH Committee votes to ban microplastics from most daily life products,"On August 30, 2022, the European Commission presented a proposal to amend the REACH Regulation in order to address the proliferation of synthetic polymer microparticles (the so-called ""microplastics""). On April 26, 2023, after a lengthy legislative process and heated discussions between member states and consultations with the various stakeholders, the REACH Committee voted in favour of the Commission's proposal. The text aims to progressively phase out microplastics of everyday products, like cosmetics, fragrances and home cleaners, as well as of fertilizers, paints and artificial sports turfs. It defines microplastics as solid polymers contained in microparticles or microparticles which have a solid polymer surface coating, and used as a substance on their own or in a mixture in a concentration equal to or greater than 0,01% by weight. According to the European Commission, the proposed restriction would prevent the release in the environment of about 500,000 tonnes of microplastics, at an estimated total cost up to EUR 19 billion Despite intense advocacy from NGOs and from some cosmetics makers, the Committee granted several industries transitional periods to implement the ban. These deadlines range from six years for sports fields and encapsulated fragrances, to five years for detergents and some pesticides, and twelve years for some leave-on makeup products, such as lipsticks and nail polish. Rinse-off cosmetic products will have a four-year transitional period. However, the text says that ""in order to encourage the substitution of synthetic polymer microparticles in make-up, lip and nail 'leave-on' cosmetic products before the end of the transitional period,"" these products will have to bear a label informing consumers that they contain microplastics, eight years after the entry into force of the regulation. Before the official adoption of the text, EU Parliament and Council have a three-month scrutiny period, after which the Regulation will enter into force immediately."
Fragrance dupes are all the rage among younger shoppers. What the price?,"On TikTok, the #dupes hashtag has no less than two billion views. All the hashtags dedicated to fragrance dupes — and there are many of them — total well over 500 million views, reflecting the interest that users have in these imitations. Beyond fragrances, dupes exist in many sectors, including fashion, but also cosmetics, with dupes of skincare products, makeup, or perfumes. While low-cost imitations are nothing new, the phenomenon has taken on particular importance in the era of social networks where the quest for ""good deals"" has become one of Gen Z's favourite sports. In terms of perfumery, the aim is to identify accessible fragrances that smell as close as possible as some of the world's great designer scents. A game that is not very difficult, as fragrance duplicates are common in a world where there is no patent for scents. On social networks, Internet users therefore publicly engage in a big-scale game of scent comparisons. According to Stylight, the scent of the Baccarat Rouge 540 fragrance from Maison Francis Kurkdjian, for instance, would have been compared by TikTok users to the much cheaper Cloud by Ariana Grande. The fact that Internet users and influencers share ""good deals"" spotted among the plethora of perfumes available on the market is not really a problem. But the game sometimes takes a curious twist. The many videos themed on the trend seem to feature a lot of products by retailers such as Zara, Lidl, Action, Primark, or Mango. We can thus learn that Zara's 'Gardenia' apparently would smell just like Yves Saint Laurent's 'Black Opium', and that 'Lovely de Suddenly' by Lidl would be a dupe of Dior's 'J'adore' scent. Outside the social networks, the media — whether specialist and generalist — often reproduce identical lists referring to the same distributors. In many cases, it looks like these comparisons might be – at least partly – controlled by third parties and are getting dangerously close to the limits set by industrial and commercial property rights. As long as they do not reproduce the designs and models of the brands they are referring to, and as long as they do not imitate their names, dupes are not considered to be counterfeits. However, certain practices may be sufficient to bring the law into play. It might be useful to remind that in 2014, a French court found that a company managing a site named www.pirate-parfum.fr was guilty of brand infringement. According to the judges, the company was not making reference to famous brands in order to compare its own products, but to profit from their fame by sparing itself the marketing design and development costs their owners did meet to become as famous as they are now. Whether they name their products dupes, generic perfumes, or designer-inspired perfumes, brands such as Nox, Divain, Eden Perfumes or Noted Aromas are using commercial practices that are very similar to those then condemned by French courts. However, none of these brands is located in France, and the case law on these subjects is quite variable from one country to another, even within the European Union. Moreover, court delay can be very long. Recently, Spanish-based chain retailer Equivalenza was sentenced by French courts to a fine of 400,000 euros - including 200,000 euros suspended - for trademark infringement with regard to major perfume brands, after almost eight years of legal proceedings! ""Equivalenza was sentenced for the distribution and use of 'correlation' tables. But, to date, the case law history on dupes is inexistent,"" highlights Xavier Guéant, Director Legal Affairs at France's Fragrance, Cosmetics and Toiletries Federation (FEBEA). ""However, this a highly symbolic decision. It marks an important step in the defence of the intangible perfumery heritage, and it should initiate a reflection about the practices of some industry players. And we are obviously very attentive to the practices that are now driven by the rise of social networks,"" adds Guéant. In parallel to a well-informed comparison from beauty addicts searching for good deals, dupes could also hide the mere reinvention – with a new name – of old practices that have been judged illegal in the past. In any case, it is very unlikely that dupes announce the advent of a new way of consuming fragrances and the emergence of what some call ""fast perfumery"". Indeed, the practice is closely linked to the innovation and creativity of major brands and cannot get any autonomy from those who set the trends."
Group of beauty brands calls on EU for swifter ban on microplastics,"Claiming to be microplastic-free already, the letter signatories [1] say the upcoming legislation does not go far nor fast enough ""in its current format,"" largely due to ""exceptionally long transition periods"". Under the current proposal, transition periods would vary from four years for rinse-off products to 12 years for certain makeup products. Encapsulated fragrances would benefit for a five to eight year delay, and leave-on cosmetic products would have six years to adapt. The main arguments supporting these transition periods are the lack of alternatives, the cost of reformulation and the potential impact on how the products perform. A list of claims that the signatories of the open letter deem irrelevant. ""The exceptionally long transition periods in the current proposal, especially 12 years for products such as make-up, remain at odds with the principles laid down in ongoing European Commission initiatives and therefore have no justification,"" they say. They believe the legislation as it is proposed now is too flexible unnecessarily lenient since alternatives already exist. ""It is clear that part of the industry doesn't want to change,"" says Sjoerd Trompetter, co-founder of Dutch personal care brand Naïf. ""We have been making microplastic-free products for ten years. With great alternatives and without complaints. So it's not that hard!"" he adds. However, there is an urgent need to act, the microplastic-free brands say. Weleda quotes recent studies that found that 9 out of 10 care products still include microplastics. They contend that in Europe alone, 7kg of plastics from cosmetics are flushed into the environment every minute. Microplastics have been found in the human blood, lungs and even the placenta. ""We urge the European Commission to implement decisive, consistent, and rapid introduction of microplastic-free legislation as a matter of urgency. We feel there is no justification for the exceptionally long 12-year transition period when certified natural cosmetics brands such as Weleda show that working without using microplastics at all has always been possible,"" says Nataliya Yarmolenko, Chief Commercial Officer at Weleda. The request would have the support of public opinion. Indeed, more than 52.000 people across Europe have already signed a petition by the Plastic Soup Foundation to ban all microplastics in cosmetics and personal care products. The open letter signatories also underpin their request on a recent study by Provenance also shows that 9 out of 10 shoppers believe sustainability and ethics-related considerations are important when buying beauty and wellness products. [2] In 2015, Cosmetics Europe had recommended manufacturers to discontinue the use of synthetic, solid and non-biodegradable plastic particles used for exfoliating and cleansing in wash-off cosmetic products placed on the market as of 2020. However, the use of plastic polymers in the cosmetics industry is far from being limited to these products. Nevertheless, the development of alternative solutions may be complex, as in the case of encapsulation, and the need for innovation is growing urgently."
"France tightens rules on ""net zero"" claims to take aim at greenwashing","One of the most consensual measures of the French Climate and Resilience Law [1], which was voted in 2021, has entered into force on January 1, 2023. The text requires to all companies that highlight the carbon neutrality of a product or service to produce a report on all the greenhouse gas emissions of the said product or service. The report must be updated every year and cover the entire life cycle, from production to disposal or recycling. It must also explain how greenhouse gas emissions will be avoided as a priority, then reduced and finally ""offset"". If the emissions of the product or service concerned have increased between two successive years, the ""carbon neutral"" claim is prohibited. Finally, the offsetting methods used for the residual emissions will have to be detailed, including the nature and description of the projects and their cost. This obligation concerns claims as ""carbon neutral"", ""zero carbon"", ""zero carbon footprint"", ""climate neutral"", ""fully compensated"", ""100% compensated"" or with any wording of equivalent meaning or scope. [2] Advertising or packaging bearing the claim of carbon neutrality must also include a link to a website detailing the company's climate plan. In case of violation, the company may have to pay a fine of 100,000 euros, which can be increased up to the total amount of the expenses devoted to the advertising campaign. The French government has said the goal is to provide transparent information for the public, to ""progressively strengthen the commitments of advertisers"" and to combat ""greenwashing"". The measures come after United Nations experts recently issued a raft of new guidelines aimed at drawing a ""red line"" around bogus net zero claims. The new recommendations from UN experts, published in November at the COP27 talks in Egypt's Sharm el-Sheikh, say firms cannot claim to be net-zero if they invest in new fossil fuels, cause deforestation or offset emissions with carbon credits instead of reducing them. UN chief Antonio Guterres has called for companies to update their net-zero pledges within a year to meet the new criteria. In November, French climate activists from the association Notre Affaire À Tous said they had filed complaints with advertising regulators in several European countries over claims that the football World Cup in Qatar would be carbon neutral. Also last year, Britain's Advertising Standards Authority hit out at HSBC for adverts promoting its green initiatives that failed to highlight the bank's contributions to greenhouse gas emissions and banned further use of the posters. Britain's financial watchdog has also proposed toughening regulations of environmental claims, including of investment product sustainability labels and restrictions on terms such as ""green"", ""sustainable"" and ""ESG"" (environmental, social, and governance)."
New York joins the list of states that ban cosmetics tested on animals,"Governor Kathy Hochul has signed into law the New York Cruelty Free Cosmetics Act (A.5653B/S.4839B) that will prohibit the manufacture and sale of cosmetics in New York State that have been tested on animals, beginning in January 2023. Instead, manufacturers will have to use widely available non-animal testing methods. However, cosmetics currently on sale will remain available and several other exceptions are provided for by the text. The bill, which was sponsored by Assemblymember Linda B. Rosenthal and State Senator Alessandra Biaggi, passed the New York State Assembly and New York State Senate with almost unanimous bi-partisan support. ""More consumers than ever are demanding cruelty-free cosmetics, and I am proud that my legislation banning the sale of cosmetics tested on animals has been signed into law. I am proud to have worked with Cruelty Free International in passing this legislation into law and look forward to seeing more states follow in New York's footsteps,"" said Linda B. Rosenthal. ""New York has finally joined the list of forty countries that have taken a stand against this harmful practice. Protecting the safety of humans by testing cosmetics is extremely important, but does not mean that animals must serve at their expense for our wellbeing,"" added Senator Alessandra Biaggi. The new legislations was also supported by the Personal Care Products Council (PCPC). With 600 member companies representing more than 90% of the U.S. beauty industry, PCPC is the leading trade association representing cosmetics and personal care products companies in the U.S. The passing of the New York Cruelty Free Cosmetics Act could pave the way to the vote of a federal legislation. ""U.S. history has shown that state activity leads to changes at the federal level. Because of New York's association with the fashion and beauty industries, passing the New York Cruelty Free Cosmetics Act could be the tipping point that leads to the passage of a federal Humane Cosmetics Act,"" commented Monica Engebretson, Head of Public Affairs North America at Cruelty Free International. The Federal Humane Cosmetics Act - the latest version of which was introduced in the House in December 2021 - would ban the sale and manufacturing of animal tested cosmetics throughout the US. More than 375 companies have signed on to support the legislation for a nationwide ban, including Walgreens, The Body Shop, Unilever, H&M and Paula's Choice, according to the Humane Society. ""Now it is up to Congress to pass the Humane Cosmetics Act to bring about a consistent standard for ending cosmetics animal testing across the country,"" said Brian Shapiro, New York state director for the Humane Society of the United States."
California bans PFAS in cosmetics and textiles,"California is once again at the forefront of the regulation of chemical substances in the United States. After having banned PFAS in paper-based food packaging and juvenile products on October 2021, the state is now prohibiting the substances in cosmetics and textiles. Sometimes referred to as ""forever chemicals,"" PFAS have been the subject of various studies and evaluations, some highlighting how these compounds can remain in the environment or have harmful effects on health. The adoption of these of restrictions on PFAS follows several warnings about their relatively frequent presence in many everyday consumer products. Last year, a study published in Environmental Science & Technology Letters on 231 cosmetics purchased in the United States and Canada showed that sevaral of them contained PFAS. [1] In detail, more than three quarters of the waterproof mascaras analyzed — but also nearly two thirds of the foundations and liquid lipsticks, and more than half of the eye and lip products — had high concentrations of fluorine, the researchers stated. On the heels of the publication of this study, two Senators had introduced a bill titled ""No PFAS in Cosmetics Act"" in order to require the FDA to ban the addition of PFAS to cosmetic products [2]. A similar proposal has been submitted in the House of Representatives [3], but both texts still need to be discussed. However, Californian legislators moved faster than those in Washington. As far as textiles are concerned, Assembly Bill No. 1817 prohibits the manufacture, distribution, or sale within the state of any new articles containing regulated PFAS beginning January 1, 2025 [4]. When it comes to cosmetics, Assembly Bill No. 2771 prohibits the manufacture, distribution, or sale of any product in the state that contains ""intentionally added PFAS"" starting January 1, 2025 [5]. The text greatly expands on AB 2762, a bill passed on September 30, 2020, that banned the manufacture, distribution, or sale of 13 specified PFAS substances in cosmetic products. Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances or PFAS are defined as fluorinated organic chemicals containing at least one fully fluorinated carbon atom. However, Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill that would have required certain businesses to submit annual reports concerning the usage of PFAS in products sold or imported in California [6]."
Cosmetics Europe calls for a science-based cosmetic products regulation,"In line with the objectives of the European Green Deal and of the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability (SCCS), the European Commission is considering a modification of the European Regulation on Cosmetic Products (CPR). The revision would include, among other points: the Generic Risk Management Approach, the concept of essentiality [2], the definition of nanomaterials, product labelling rules, safety assessment and combination effects. The public consultation launched on this issue at the end of March was closed on June 21. In its contribution to the public consultation, Cosmetics Europe laid down its recommendations , urging the European Commission to take a holistic approach to the revision process and see it in the overall context of various legislations stemming from the European Green Deal so that coherence and consistency across legislations can be ensured. Cosmetics Europe says it fully supports the objectives of the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability (CSS) of increasing the protection of health and environment, whilst boosting innovation and promoting EU competitiveness. However, the organisation recommends that any revision of the CPR should: – foster a sustainable (globally) competitive cosmetics sector, entrepreneurship and innovation capacity; – strengthen its science-based, proportionate, effective and efficient approach, addressing human and environmental safety in the interest of consumers, industry and authorities; – acknowledge the long history of a high level of safety of European cosmetic products and keep, at its core, the principle of scientific safety-based risk assessment; – remain the ""Gold Standard"" and international reference worldwide; – maintain a level of regulatory burden achievable and manageable particularly by SMEs; and – be future-proofed by introducing digital labelling provisions. According to Cosmetics Europe, this notably involves maintaining a dedicated independent scientific committee for cosmetics safety assessment, and derogations to the concept of essentiality where safety the safety of cosmetics containing the concerned substances can be unambiguously demonstrated. Furthermore, Cosmetics Europe also says an additional systematic safety margin for all cosmetic ingredients should not be introduced. ""It is not necessary and would have significant negative impacts on practically all cosmetic products, consumer choice and public health, without a demonstrated positive effect on consumer safety,"" the organisation states. Eventually, while welcoming the introduction of a horizontal definition of nanomaterials and mandatory digital labelling requirements, Cosmetics Europe asks the Commission to ensure enough time for the industry to transition. The pevious week, the International Fragrance Association (IFRA) raised concerns about the consequences of the European Commission's strategy for the sustainability of chemicals. A new study, commissioned by the fragrance industry trade association, suggests a negative impact on the industry of up to EUR 2 billion per year."
The fragrance industry expresses concerns about the EU's Green Deal,"The study, by consultancy Ricardo Energy & Environment, focuses on how specific proposals within the European Union Commission's proposed Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability (CSS) may affect fragrance companies and the wider industry in Europe. It suggests that more than a quarter of the industry's portfolio in turnover terms would be affected in some way by the proposed changes. This impact would be felt by consumers, says the report, with a reduction in choice of products that people consider important to their mental and physical wellbeing. ""The study highlights the challenges posed by the current plans to the long-term socio-economic sustainability of our sector, especially for small businesses, which make up half of all companies in the European fragrance industry,"" commented Martina Bianchini, IFRA President. As well as addressing the potential impact on the fragrance industry, the study highlights a 'ripple' effect on the wider fragrance value chain – from raw materials suppliers, to manufacturers, consumer goods companies and retailers – due to the need to substitute and reformulate products. Published on 14 October 2020, within the EU's Green Deal, the chemicals strategy for sustainability aims to create a toxic-free environment for EU citizens, in a context where the global chemicals production is forecast to double between 2020 and 2030. It is part of the EU's zero pollution ambition, which is a key commitment of the European Green Deal. Among other things, the strategy promises to ban the most harmful chemicals in consumer products, to take into account the cocktail effect of chemicals when assessing risks from chemicals. IFRA explains that the proposals of the chemicals strategy for sustainability include: an extension of the General Approach to Risk Management (GRA) that does not take account of the specificities of fragrances; the addition of hazard classes to the EU Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation (CLP); and the introduction of a 'mixture assessment factor' to assess combination effects of chemicals. IFRA President, Martina Bianchini, expressed her support for the overall objectives of the EU Green Deal, but adds the transition ""can only be successful if it promotes sustainable growth, covering social, economic, environmental, and cultural dimensions."" Data for the study was collected from dozens of companies, large and small, from across Europe. It will be used as input to the ongoing consultative process. IFRA will present the findings to European decision-makers as work progresses on implementation of the CSS."
Bondi Sands faces US class action over 'reef friendly' claim for sunscreens,"In a class action complaint filed in the US District Court in Northern California, Bondi Sands is accused of mislabelling several sunscreen products available in the US as ""reef friendly"" while they contain chemical filters, such as avobenzone, homoslate, octisalate, and/or octocrylene, which according to the plaintiff ""are not safe for reefs"" [Moran v. Bondi Sands (U.S.) Inc., 21-cv-07961-JSW (N.D. Cal. Apr. 29, 2022)] [1]. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, which revealed the case, other sunscreen makers, including Banana Boat and Edgewell Personal Care [2], are facing similar complaints. In response to questions from the Australian newspaper, Bondi Sands said their ""sunscreen products are made in Australia and are compliant with TGA regulations, which are the strongest SPF guidelines in the world, and are compliant with strict EU and FDA laws."" On their website, the Melbourne-headquartered company now provides a definition of what does ""Reef Friendly"" mean according to them: the absence of oxybenzone [3] and octinoxate [4]. ""It's important to know that the term ""Reef Friendly"" is not defined or regulated by authorities, so when you see these words on Bondi Sands sunscreens, it simply means that our entire suncare range has been formulated in compliance with Hawaii's regulations and is free of oxybenzone and octinoxate. We will continue to evolve our product formulations based on guidance from both local and international authorities,"" the website quotes. Indeed, since January 1, 2021, the U.S. State of Hawaii has banned sunscreens containing these two filters, but did not provide a definition of what would be a reef of coral safe product. The class actions against Bondi Sands and other manufacturers should therefore focus mainly on the question of how misleading the terms 'reef friendly' and 'reef safe' are for consumers without any expertise in the formulation of sunscreen products. While the negative effects of oxybenzone on corals are fairly well documented, the impact of the numerous chemical UV filters washed into the oceans every year is still a subject of controversy, with some scientists insisting on the impact of global warming. However, research on this issue is making advances and some mechanisms of action are now better understood."
US Congress moves to ban discrimination of race-related hairstyles,"The bill (H.R. 2116, aka the CROWN Act of 2022), which now moves to the Senate, explicitly aims to protect Black Americans who have been forced to cut their hair or style it in a certain way while at school or work. ""As a Black woman who loves my braids, I know what it's like to feel isolated because of how I wear my hair,"" said Cori Bush, a Black representative from Missouri, just before the vote. Black Americans have long explained they are often treated unfairly at work and in schools because of their natural hair or protective styles like braids, knots, twists and locks and have been forced to cut their hair or change their style in a certain way to comply with standards corresponding to other ethnical hair textures. Recently, numerous instances of this kind of discrimination have risen to public attention in the United States. In late 2019, a Black teen in Texas was suspended from school and threatened with expulsion if she did not cut her dreadlocks, which officials had deemed too long. Her case provoked a heated national debate over systemic racism in schools. Another case occurred in December 2018, when a referee forced a Black wrestler to cut his hair or face disqualification, arguing that his hairstyle was against the rules. According to recent a research by Dove, a Black woman in the U.S. is 80% more likely to change her natural hair to meet social norms or expectations at work [1]. Opponents of the bill, like the Republican Jim Jordan, accused Democrats of ""avoiding the issues the American people care about,"" like inflation and the soaring cost of gasoline. ""I believe we can walk and chew gum at the same time,"" shot back Sheila Jackson Lee, a Black representative from Texas. The White House said President Joe Biden supports the bill, and underlined his belief that ""no person should be denied the ability to obtain a job, succeed in school or the workplace, secure housing, or otherwise exercise their rights based on a hair texture or hair style."" While the Democrat-sponsored bill garnered some Republican votes, most Republicans voted against it, making the bill's fate in the evenly-divided Senate uncertain. Several US states have already taken the step to ban hair discrimination, starting with California in the summer of 2019, immediately followed by New York. And after years of only allowing women in the military to wear a tight bun, the US Army revised its standards in January 2021 to better reflect the diversity in its ranks. If the Crown Act becomes law, natural hair discrimination would be treated as if it were race or national origin discrimination under federal civil rights law. Outside the U.S. too, people with afro hair texture explain they often feel obliged to change the natural texture of their hair in order to comply with social standards. Understanding that hair (or skin) stereotypes are closely intertwined, cosmetic brands have progressively changed their approach of the issue, even concerning the words the use to describe the different hair types or hair styles and whether to change them… or not."
All cosmetic products can now apply for the EU Ecolabel,"The European Commission has adopted new European Union Ecolabel criteria for cosmetics and animal-care products. As a consequence, all cosmetic products, as defined under the EU Cosmetic Regulation, can now apply for the label. Previous requirements for cosmetics to be awarded the EU Ecolabel covered a limited range of so-called 'rinse-off' products such as body wash, shampoo and conditioner. The updated rules include 'leave-on' cosmetics such as creams, oils, skin-care lotions, deodorants and anti-perspirants, sunscreens, as well as hairstyling and make-up products. The purpose of the EU Ecolabel is to help to reduce the environmental impact of products on water, soil and biodiversity, contributing to ""a clean and circular economy and a toxic-free environment."" As far as cosmetic products are concerned, the ecolabel criteria promote products that have limited impacts in terms of eco-toxicity and biodegradability, and that use less packaging, which can be easily recycled. The use of recycled material and refillable packaging is promoted. There are also sustainable sourcing requirements for some ingredients such as palm oil, palm kernel oil and their derivatives The new requirements set a total ban on substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction, on substances of very high concern, nanomaterials, those identified or suspected of having endocrine disrupting properties, phthalates, and perfluorinated and polyfluorinated substances, as well as on microplastics. The EU Ecolabel also sets rules to guarantee that packaging is minimised and/or easy-to-recycle. ""I encourage companies to apply for the EU Ecolabel and profit from its established reputation. The EU Ecolabel helps guide concerned consumers towards reliable, certified green products and supports the transition to a clean and circular economy,"" said Virginijus Sinkevičius, EU Commissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries. Awarded after assessment by an independent organisation, this label could perhaps give substance to clean beauty, which remains a vague notion for many consumers. According to the European Environment Bureau, the expansion of the eco-label to new categories could help fight greenwashing which, according to the NGO, is proliferating in the cosmetics industry, with ""three out of four products in the EU displaying an environmental claim or label."""
Mexico's Senate unanimously votes to ban animal testing for cosmetic products,"In an unanimous vote (103 votes in favor), the senators approved the changes proposed by the Chamber of Deputies to the project aiming at prohibiting animal tests for cosmetic products. The bill is derived from an initiative presented, in April 2019, by Senator Ricardo Monreal Ávila. As a consequence, the country's General Health Law (Ley General de Salud) will prohibit manufacturing, importing or marketing cosmetic products that have been tested on animals or contains ingredients or combinations of ingredients that have been tested on animals. The bill was supported by animal rights advocacy groups the Humane Society International Mexico and Te Protejo. ""We are thrilled to see Mexico become the first country in North America to outlaw cosmetic animal testing, and commend our bill sponsor Senator Ricardo Monreal, and all congressmen and women for voting to end cosmetic animal testing in Mexico,"" said the organizations in a statement. Commenting on the vote, Senator Ricardo Monreal Ávila called it ""historic"": El @senadomexicano aprobó, por unanimidad, la iniciativa #BellezaSinCrueldad, cuyo objetivo es prohibir el uso de animales en experimentos de la industria cosmética, y fomentar el desarrollo de mecanismos alternativos. @_AnimalHeroes_ @HSI_Mexico pic.twitter.com/UytwD6godR — Ricardo Monreal A. (@RicardoMonrealA) September 3, 2021 The bill was also supported by Lush, Unilever, P&G, L'Oréal, Avon and others in the beauty industry, who are working with HSI globally through the Animal-Free Safety Assessment (AFSA) toward policy alignment, and training measures to support smaller companies and government authorities in transitioning from animal testing to state-of-the-art non-animal methods, which are readily available. With the addition of Mexico, animal testing for cosmetics is officially already banned in 41 countries, as well as 10 states in Brazil and seven in the United States. Three other U.S. states - New Jersey, Rhode Island and New York - are currently considering similar bills, and federal bills are pending reintroduction in both the U.S. and Canada."
Cosmetics brands campaign against ECHA to maintain EU's ban on animal testing,"Animal rights groups and cosmetics industry giants are joining forces to say no to the re-introduction of animal testing for cosmetic products in Europe. The move follows new requirements from ECHA, the European Chemicals Agency, seeking to make animal testing possible again in order to evaluate certain substances already used in the industry. The Body Shop and Dove, with the support of organizations including PETA, Cruelty Free Europe, HSI, Eurogroup for Animals and ECEAE, are today calling on European citizens to mobilize against these decisions by signing a ""European Citizen's Initiative"" petition now available online. In a joint statement, the brands explain that animal testing is no longer necessary to ensure safety in cosmetics, since modern, scientific, non-animal and equally human-relevant methods have been developed and used by specialists for decades. After many campaigns and advances in the fight against animal cruelty, the ban on the sale of cosmetic products tested on animals came into force in March 2013 in the European Union. The ban proved a model in the field, inspiring debate and reflection in many other countries around the world. But NGOs and cosmetics industry players now fear a return to the past following a decision by the ECHA's Board of Appeal in 2020 to conduct tests on animals to assess two substances, homosalate and 2-ethylhexyl salicylate. While terminating animal testing on finished products was achieved well before 2013, putting an end to the tests on ingredients required a huge amount of investment to develop alternative methods. And most of the research has been funded by the industry. ""At Dove, we stand passionately against animal cruelty. We strongly believe that there is no role for animal testing for beauty products or their ingredients, and have pioneered safe and humane alternatives to assess the safety of products and ingredients for many years. This commitment drives us to take urgent action to protect the ban against animal testing in the EU,"" explains Firdaous El Honsali, Senior Director of Global Communications and Sustainability at Dove. In order to make the European petition known to as many people as possible, The Body Shop and Dove are taking to the streets of Berlin, Paris, Milan and Madrid with a full-scale awareness campaign. Thus, citizens will discover dedicated artworks on the walls of their cities, together with a slogan inviting people to join the fight to end animal testing and save cruelty-free cosmetics in Europe. The campaign is being led hand in hand with the artist and activist, Nina Valkhoff. ""It's sad that — once again — we have to fight a battle that Europe's citizens thought they had already won, but with a successful European Citizens' Initiative (ECI), we can make decision-makers listen, protect the groundbreaking bans, and secure concerted action to end the suffering of animals in EU laboratories for good,"" hope the animal protection groups involved alongside the two cosmetic brands."
USA: Study prompts Senate bill to ban PFAS in cosmetic products,"The study recently published in Environmental Science & Technology Letters surveyed some 231 cosmetics purchased in the United States and Canada [1] and therefore submitted to the regulations concerning chemicals in cosmetics in these countries. However, this new research builds on previous, more limited studies that detected PFAS in cosmetics sold in Europe and Japan. Using particle-induced gamma-ray emission (PIGE) spectroscopy to rapidly screen total fluorine concentrations, the researchers first found that most of the waterproof mascaras, liquid lipsticks and foundations tested contained fluorine. According to the authors, this indicates the ""probable presence"" of PFAS in the tested items. In detail, more than three quarters of the waterproof mascaras analyzed — but also nearly two thirds of the foundations and liquid lipsticks, and more than half of the eye and lip products — had high concentrations of fluorine, the researchers state. The products with the highest levels of fluorine were analyzed further. The verdict: they all contained at least four PFAS that the researchers consider to be ""of concern."" A total of twenty-nine products were selected for further analysis, which revealed detectable levels of at least four specific PFAS in all of them. The study authors note that these included ""PFAS that break down into other PFAS that are known to be highly toxic and environmentally harmful."" Sometimes referred to as ""forever chemicals,"" PFAS have been the subject of various studies and evaluations, some highlighting how these compounds can remain in the environment or have harmful effects on health. The study also revealed that only a scarce few products, among those that were further analyzed, mentioned the presence of these substances on their ingredients list. According to the authors of the study, this may be linked to the ""series of exemptions and generalized guidelines for polymers, silanes and siloxanes, color additives, and substituted compounds"" that complicate the use of the International Cosmetic Ingredient (INCI) Dictionary and Handbook. According to the Personal Care Products Council (PCPC), the trade association that gathers the main producers of cosmetic and personal care products in the USA, some of the fluorine levels detected in the study could be the result of trace amounts from materials naturally occurring in the environment or as a result of the manufacturing process. ""Since trace amounts are not intentionally added to products, they are not required to be listed on the label. FDA recognizes their possible presence and offers guidance on allowable levels,"" commented Alexandra Kowcz, Chief Scientist, Personal Care Products Council. ""All cosmetic products and their ingredients are subject to the same safety requirement under the FD&C Act - they must be shown to be safe for consumers before they are marketed. The labeling of those products must be truthful and not misleading,"" she added. In the wake of the publication of the study, Senators Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) introduced a bill titled ""No PFAS in Cosmetics Act"" in order to require the FDA to ban the addition of PFAS to cosmetic products. Let's note that several PFASs were banned by the Toxic Free Cosmetics Act that was passed in California last year. ""Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a diverse group of chemicals with more than 6,000 ingredients and widely differing chemistries. It is inappropriate to assume that anything with a fluorine atom has the same safety profile. (...) PCPC, working with the Environmental Working Group, has supported prohibition of certain PFAS from use in cosmetics. Our member companies take their responsibility for product safety and the trust families put in those products very seriously. Science and safety are the foundation for everything we do,"" emphasized Alexandra Kowcz."
China to end compulsory animal testing for imported cosmetics on May 1,"A series of drafts aiming at implementing the new Chinese regulations on cosmetics [1] had given a glimpse of this possible exemption. Now it's official! Indeed, the Provisions for Management of Cosmetic Registration and Notification Dossiers, which were published on March 4th by China's National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), provide that so-called ""general"" cosmetic products can be imported into China without having to be tested on animals first. Actually, as far as cosmetic products are concerned, Chinese regulations make a distinction between two categories of products: ""special-use"" cosmetics and ""general"" cosmetics. ""Special use"" cosmetics include: hair dyes, hair perming products, freckle-removing/whitening products, sunscreens, anti hair loss products, as well as all cosmetics ""claiming new efficacy"". All other products complying with the definition of cosmetics given by the Cosmetic Supervision and Administration Regulation (CSAR) are classified as ""general cosmetics"". The exemption from animal testing therefore concerns the majority of cosmetics imported into China. However, to benefit from this exemption regime, the Provisions for Management of Cosmetic Registration and Notification Dossiers require to provide two documents: – A certificate of compliance to the good manufacturing practices (GMP), issued by the competent authority of the country of origin; – The results of the product's safety assessment. Depending on the country of origin, obtaining GMP compliance certificates could be more or less difficult. In France, however, governmental authorities have anticipated the publication of the Chinese text and provided for an online procedure for requesting and obtaining the document. In addition, certain ""general"" cosmetic products will still have to be tested on animals when they are imported into China: – Products intended to be used by children; – Products using new ingredients (as defined by the Chinese regulations) during the compulsory 3-year monitoring period; – Products notified, imported or manufactured by a person listed as a key supervision target by the NMPA. ""We were pleased to see that the anticipated update to China's cosmetics animal testing rules by the National Medical Products Administration has been finalised, exempting some imported ordinary cosmetics from mandatory animal testing from May 1st this year. While some ingredients and products remain ineligible and there are questions about GMP requirements, it is too early for cruelty free certainty, but we're definitely getting closer. We hope that it won't be too long before Leaping Bunny brands will be able to import their cosmetics ranges into China and stay cruelty free,"" commented Michelle Thew, CEO of animal welfare organisation Cruelty Free International. Despite these restrictions, this is an important step towards removing impediments on accessing the Chinese market."
Brazil's Anvisa clarifies new ingredients labelling rules for cosmetics,"Anvisa, the Brazilian agency responsible for overseeing the safety of drugs and cosmetics, has just published a technical note (Nota Técnica (NT) 5/2021 [1]) specifying the procedures for labelling in Portuguese the ingredients of perfumes and hygiene and cosmetic products sold in the country. The note complements the rules laid down in the resolution (RDC) 432/2020 of November 4, 2020, which provides that personal hygiene products, cosmetics and perfumes marketed in Brazil must be labelled with the list of their ingredients in Portuguese. ""The International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI) remains mandatory in the labelling of personal hygiene products, cosmetics and perfumes,"" Anvisa first emphasizes in its note. In practical, as the November text already mentioned, the translation into Portuguese appears to be a complement to the INCI list, the two pieces of information will thus have to coexist on the label, whether on the original product label or thanks to an additional label sufficiently resistant so that the information cannot be removed or erased, even partially. Regarding the translation of INCI terms, operators will have to refer to the official Brazilian pharmacopoeia (Denominação Comum Brasileira - DCB). In the absence of a translation available in the DCB, the Agency advises companies to translate the INCI terms in accordance with the method provided in Article 7 of DRC 63/2012, namely: a) the translation must respect the usual spelling and phonetics of the Portuguese language of Brazil; (b) the translation must be distinct phonetically and by its spelling from other existing translations and be spelled as simply as possible; (c) the use of a trade name, trademark or other fanciful name in the translation is prohibited; and d) translations which, due to their spelling or phonetics, would induce a reference to anatomical, physiological, pathological or therapeutic effects or which could lead to confusion with other names, should be avoided. The technical note also details the rules to be followed so that the information be clear for consumers: a) the translation of the ingredients into Portuguese must appear in parentheses or after a bar, next to the corresponding terms in the INCI list, which must be introduced by the terms Composição or Ingredientes; or in a separate list preceded by the terms Composição (português) or Ingredientes (português); b) ingredients in Portuguese will be in the same order as in the INCI list of ingredients; c) the terms ""e o corante"", ""e os corantes"" or ""Pode conter os corantes"": must precede the list of colour additives in Portuguese; d) knowing that these different terms may or may not be in upper case. The entire Technical Note (NT) 5/2021 is available (in Portuguese) here below or on the Brazilian government website www.gov.br"
"Allergenic fragrances found in cosmetics sold as ""perfume-free"" in Europe","Conducted by the European Network of Official Cosmetics Control Laboratories (OCCLs) the market surveillance study was part of the Council of Europe's effort to assess compliance of cosmetic products with European legislation governing their safety, labelling and claims. In total, 932 samples of cosmetics, such as skin, hair and lip care products, as well as deodorants and perfumes, were collected in eight European countries between 2018 and 2020. The sampled products had been manufactured in 34 different countries, with the majority (85%) manufactured in Europe. Of these, 544 samples were marked ""perfume-free"" (or a similar statement). The overall compliance of products tested in this market surveillance study was 80% but it fell to 59% for perfumes. All samples were tested for the presence of 24 allergenic fragrance compounds [1]. Results showed that 7.7% of samples were non-compliant with legislative requirements due to a missing or false declaration of allergenic fragrance compounds and 2.3% due to claims that the authorities considered misleading. Furthermore, 3.1% [2] of products marketed as ""perfume-free"" contained allergenic fragrance compounds. Linalool, benzyl alcohol and limonene were the most frequent sources of non-compliance. The study also found 12.7% of non-compliant samples for other reasons than the analysis of allergenic fragrance compounds. Most of the problems were linked to wrong labelling or unauthorised claims. Missing or wrong notifications in the CPNP portal were also identified. Preservatives not in accordance with Annex V of Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 (iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, methylisothiazolinone), high content of cadmium or low molecular weight mineral-oil compound in lip-care products accounted for further objections. Two products (0.2%) were assessed as unsafe products, one due to the prohibited use of iodopropynyl butylcarbamate in a body lotion and one because of microbiological contamination. According to the EDQM, there was no significant difference in the non-compliance levels within the different European countries included in the study. ""Ensuring compliance of cosmetic products is key to avoiding potential health risks. The problems revealed by this study demonstrate the continuing need for close co-operation between Official Cosmetics Control Laboratories, in the interest of public health in Europe,"" commented Susanne Keitel, Director of the EDQM."
Brazil: Anvisa changes cosmetics labeling rules,"From November next year, the labels of cosmetic products sold in Brazil will have to be labeled with a Portuguse translation of their list of ingredients. This translation will be added to the INCI [1] list currently required. According to the article 1 of the resolution RDC No 432, approved by the collegial council of the Agency, the text was adopted because of a court decision in a civil action. According to article 2, ""personal hygiene products, cosmetics and perfumes marketed in Brazil must be labeled with the list of their ingredients in Portuguese, without prejudice to other requirements provided for in the regulations in force."" Consequently, the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI) remains mandatory and must appear on the products. The Portuguese translation and the INCI list will thus coexist on the label. In fact, the composition in Portuguese may be included either on the product's original label or in a complementary label, provided that the integrity of the colors and the material with which the label is made is guaranteed, in order to prevent it from being partially or totally removed. The measure was published in the Federal Official Journal on November 5, 2020 and comes into force a year from this date, on November 5, 2021. Products manufactured before November 5, 2021 can be marketed without a list of ingredients in Portuguese until their respective expiration dates (art. 3)."
Cosmetics giants say EU authorities are undermining cosmetic animal testing ban,"The call comes in the wake of two decisions by the Board of Appeal of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) [1] last August, requiring German chemicals manufacturer Symrise to carry out several toxicity tests on animals on two chemical UV filtres (homosalate and 2-ethylhexyl salicylate), used exclusively in sunscreen formulations, to fulfil 'tick-box' registration requirements for worker safety under the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation. According to the signatories, the EU's animal testing ban ""success story is now being undermined"" by the European Chemicals Agency and its Board of Appeal, continuing ""the trend of systematically requesting unnecessary animal data despite a legal obligation to promote non-animal methods."" They say that, far from ensuring occupational safety for workers in chemical manufacturing plants, ""these data demands are to ensure ECHA has an administratively complete set of data for hazard classification and labelling, regardless of whether additional data are in fact needed to ensure worker protection."" Actually, Avon, L'Oréal, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Lush and Humane Society International consider that lessons learned in animal-free safety assessment of cosmetics over many years can be ""readily applied to occupational safety assessment of ingredients without compromising human safety"". With no reaction yet from the European Commission, the signatories fear the two chemical ingredients currently under ECHA's scrutiny could be just ""the tip of the iceberg"", with the EU Chemicals Agency and some Member States demanding new animal tests for cosmetics at a time when the rest of the world is taking action to eliminate them. ""This is a direct threat to the EU's historic ban on cosmetics animal testing which is widely supported by consumers and cosmetic companies alike because causing animals to suffer and die for beauty products or their ingredients is both ethically and scientifically unjustified. Chemical authorities need to urgently shift their perspective to embrace 21st century science instead of dragging us back to cruel and outdated animal tests,"" said Marina Pereira, Humane Society International's regulatory science advisor. If one refers to the two decisions of the ECHA Board of Appeal (below), the growing contradiction between two regulations pursuing opposing goals reads clearly. According to ECHA, these tests are needed to assess the safety of ingredients. The Board of Appeal says that, if this safety is confirmed, the tests will not have to be included in the cosmetic file and will therefore not lead to a ban on the marketing of the ingredients concerned. At no time is the goal of eliminating animal testing mentioned in the decisions. Obviously, this is not in the Board's scope of concerns. For the cosmetics industry, the goal now seems to have recognition of the validity of alternative methods under the REACH regulation, even if it means having to adapt them."
Might California's new regulations help upgrade confidence in beauty products?,"Signed into law on 1 October 2020, the set of legislations originates from two bills: Assembly Bill 2762, dubbed ""California's 'Toxic-free Cosmetics' Act"", and Senate Bill No. 312, also known as ""Cosmetic Fragrance and Flavor Right to Know Act"" (see documents here below). The first text prohibits 12 chemicals in cosmetics sold in California starting in 2025, all of which are already banned by the European Union, under Annex II of Regulation No. 1223/2009. Under the second text, manufacturers of cosmetics sold in California will have to disclose their products' fragrance ingredient information to the Division of Environmental and Occupational Disease Control within the California State Department of Public Health. The obligation applies in particular to fragrance allergens as listed in Annex III of the EU Cosmetics Regulation No 1223/2009 and subsequent updates, when at or above the following concentrations: 0.01% (100 ppm) in rinse-off cosmetics and 0.001% (10 ppm) in leave-on cosmetics. These new provisions strengthen the legislative framework for cosmetics in California, already the most stringent in the United States. They are the result of concomitant and joint actions from consumer associations, feminist movements and environmental activist groups who have raised public awareness on the discrepancies between the US and EU legislation, thus contributing to sparkle the 'clean beauty' movement in the country. The US industry has traditionally denied that the EU legislation would offer a better level of consumer protection than the US one. The main argument was that the general safety requirement was sufficient. This line of reasoning suggested it was useless to explicitly ban specific substances from cosmetic products since cosmetic makers, legally responsible for product safety, would not knowingly use substances that endanger consumers. Indeed, most of the substances prohibited by the European legislation are never used in cosmetics sold in the United States. Most but not all. A laissez-faire logic which has the advantage of not imposing excessive regulatory constraints on new entrants, these start-up companies which contribute so much to the dynamism of the American market. However, it fails to admit that the safety assessment of a substance and a formula is a very complex job that is highly regulated in Europe, but not at all in the United States. While US multinationals, which sell around the world, tend to align their practices with the most stringent rules, this is not always the case with smaller players. Eventually, the growing gap in the level of requirements between European texts, which are regularly updated according to scientific progress, and the American legislation, which remained almost unchanged since the beginning of the 20th century, generated distrust among U.S. consumers. By once again playing a leadership role at the national level, California could push for the adoption of similar rules across the country. Even if this is not the case, the need to market their products in the Union's most populous state will prompt many American manufacturers to adapt their formulations. In contrast, the impact on consumers is much more uncertain. In Europe, a much more robust legal framework has not prevented mistrust from taking hold. Actually, trust cannot be decreed, it is built. For instance, in 2017, Mintel pointed out that only 24% of Italians, 30% of French and 39% of English trusted the cosmetics industry. ""Companies must be ready to provide consumers with quantified and qualified facts,"" explained the market research firm. In a post-truth and post-trust world, transparency and trustworthiness become the key tools for building trust. When action groups need to pressure lawmakers to get more transparency from the industry, it is unlikely to reinforce confidence, on the contrary it is likely to reinforce preexisting doubts. Doubts on which young brands have skillfully learned to build their marketing ..."
California officially bans a series of toxic chemicals in cosmetics,"Introduced by Assembly member Al Muratsuchi, the Assembly Bill 2762, dubbed ""California's 'Toxic-free Cosmetics' Act"", prohibits 12 toxic chemicals in cosmetics in California starting in 2025, all of which are already banned by the European Union, under Annex II of Regulation No. 1223/2009. ""The science is clear on the harmful nature of these chemicals and AB 2762 will provide Californians with the same consumer protections already provided in the European Union. I thank Governor Newsom for his support and the bill cosponsors for their leadership and hard work to get this bill signed into law,"" said Assembly member Al Muratsuchi. The new law bans 12 substances: 1. Dibutyl phthalate (CAS no. 84-74-2) 2. Diethylhexyl phthalate (CAS no. 117-81-7) 3. Formaldehyde (CAS no. 50-00-0) 4. Paraformaldehyde (CAS no. 30525-89-4) 5. Methylene glycol (CAS no. 463-57-0) 6. Quaternium-15 (CAS no. 51229-78-8) 7. Mercury (CAS no. 7439-97-6) 8. Isobutylparaben (CAS no. 4247-02-3) 9. Isopropylparaben (CAS no. 4191-73-5) 10. m-Phenylenediamine and its salts (CAS no. 108-45-2) 11. o-Phenylenediamine and its salts (CAS no. 95-54-5) 12. per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and their salts: – Perfluor­ooctane sulfonate (PFOS); heptadec­afluorooctane-1-sulfonic acid (CAS no. 1763-23-1) – Potassium perfluor­ooctanesulfonate; potassium heptadec­afluorooctane-1-sulfonate (CAS no. 2795-39-3) – Diethano­lamine perfluor­ooctane sulfonate (CAS 70225-14-8) – Ammonium perfluor­ooctane sulfonate; ammonium heptadec­afluorooctanesulfonate (CAS 29081-56-9) – Lithium perfluor­ooctane sulfonate; lithium heptadec­afluorooctanesulfonate (CAS 29457-72-5) – Perfluor­ooctanoic acid (PFOA)(CAS no. 335-67-1) – Ammonium pentadec­afluorooctanoate (CAS no. 3825-26-1) – Nonadeca­fluorodecanoic acid (CAS no. 355-76-2) – Ammonium nonadeca­fluorodecanoate (CAS no. 3108-42-7) – Sodium nonadeca­fluorodecanoate (CAS no. 3830-45-3) – Perfluor­ononanoic acid (PFNA)(CAS no. 375-95-1) – Sodium heptadec­afluorononanoate (CAS no. 21049-39-8) – Ammonium perfluor­ononanoate (CAS no. 4149-60-4) Both the Environmental Working Group (EWG) and the Personal Care Products Council (PCPC) applauded Governor Newsom for signing the Bill into law. Indeed, this very symbolic text was supported by both the NGO and representatives of the cosmetics industry. ""Californians now have greater assurance of the safety of the consumer products they use every day, like lotion and body wash, toothpaste, shampoo and conditioner, and makeup,"" said EWG President Ken Cook. ""This marks a momentous milestone in the history of cosmetics and personal care products regulation. And for the first time, groups like EWG along with a diverse group of stakeholders and the industry's trade association, the Personal Care Products Council, support legislation to modernize the rules governing these products."" In practice, this law should not disrupt fundamentally the habits of cosmetics makers, since most of the substances concerned are hardly found in personal care products sold in the United States. ""We all agree that this bill helps protect public health in California while safeguarding the jobs of the more than the 415,000 Californians who work for the overall personal care industry and the more than $28 billion contributed to the state's economy,"" said PCPC President & CEO Lezlee Westine. The law only addresses substances added ""intentionally"" and does provide for unavoidable trace contaminants that occur during manufacturing. Read the full text here below:"
Cruelty Free International extends support to brands selling in China,"Cruelty Free International and Australian aromatherapy, natural skincare and wellness brand, Subtle Energies have announced the successful shift of the animal welfare organization's Shanghai-based Leaping Bunny pilot project to an all-China route to market for cruelty free certified international brands. As a matter of fact, Subtle Energies will now supply Peninsula Spa, based in the Chinese capital. Back in 2018, Cruelty-Free International launched its Leaping Bunny China Pilot Program, which helps leaping bunny approved brands to enter the Chinese market without having to test perform animal tests. Before entering this new phase in their Chinese journey Cruelty Free International worked closely with Shanghai-based regulatory advisors Knudsen&CRC to carefully review the recent regulatory changes announced by Chinese authorities, in particular the possible end of compulsory animal testing for imported ""ordinary"" cosmetics (also named ""general cosmetics""). [1] ""Our pilot allowed us to ensure that expertise was on hand to allow companies to remain free from pre-market animal testing and expertly find a way through all the other requirements. To manage the complex issue of post-market testing - testing that could take place on a product after it has hit the shelves - we worked closely with Oriental Beauty Valley and Fengxian district, Shanghai to be sure this would not happen,"" explained the organization. All international Leaping Bunny brands wanting to sell in China using this all-China route must: – Agree plans with Cruelty Free International; – Manufacture the products at approved facilities within China; – Maintain ongoing contact with their distributors and retailers to monitor any risks of animal testing; – Only use ingredients that already feature on the list of approved cosmetics and personal care ingredients in China (in other cases, animal tests will be required by Chinese authorities); – Not include special use cosmetics in their sales offer (as animal tests are required for these products). As an increasing number of countries globally, and lately Colombia, are prohibiting animal testing for cosmetic purposes, in the wake of the EU initiative in 2013, China's rules requiring that all ""special cosmetics"" and imported ""general cosmetics"" (locally made ""general cosmetics"" are exempted under certain conditions) has long been see as a major impediment to trade. Indeed, some brands have given up their prospects regarding the Chinese market so as not to be forced to test their products on animals. However, the situation could change. Following the publication on 29 June 2020 of the long-awaited Cosmetics Supervision and Administration Regulation (CSAR), which will replace the existing Cosmetics Hygiene Supervision Regulations, which was first released in 1989, it is expected imported ""ordinary cosmetics"" will no longer have to be tested on animals. While the CSAR is note clear on this issue, a formal and official clarification should come in the next few months. ""Although it is anticipated that regulations will follow to spell out that non-special use imported cosmetics would no longer require animal tests as part of their safety assessment if other specified requirements are fulfilled, until these are published and details become clear, Leaping Bunny brands remain unable to export into mainland China,"" highlights Cruelty Free International. For so-called ""special cosmetics"", the legal situation is even worse, since hardly any exemption from animal testing is expected yet."
Colombia to ban use of animals in cosmetics testing by 2024,"The bill has been in the works since 2018, initially introduced by vegan House Representative Juan Carlos Losada. A recognized environmental and animal advocate, Mr. Losada welcomed the news on Twitter: ¡TENEMOS LEY! Colombia el primer país suramericano que prohíbe las pruebas cosméticas con animales! Aquí puedes consultar la Ley 2047 de 2020 https://t.co/DDz5hM4NWY pic.twitter.com/STdqnrEiiV — Juan Carlos Losada ॐ (@JuanKarloslos) August 12, 2020 The Law 2047 of August 10, 2020 (available here, in Spanish) prohibits the import, manufacture and marketing in Colombia of cosmetic products and their ingredients when they have been tested on animals. These provisions will come into force 4 years after the promulgation of the law. However, the law provides for two exceptions. The first, when an ingredient requires safety tests, in the interest of human health or to assess its safety to the environment and there are no alternative tests validated by the international scientific community. The second: when safety data generated through animal testing for an ingredient has been performed for a purpose other than cosmetic. Actually, these provisions are quite similar to those already in force within the European Union."
California's Toxic-Free Cosmetics Act moves forward after Committee vote,"On Thursday May 14th, the Assembly Bill 2762 passed out of the State Assembly Committee on Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials. Authored by Assembly man Al Muratsuchi (D-Torrance) a co-sponsored by Assembly Members Bill Quirk (D-Hayward) and Buffy Wicks (D-Oakland), the bill would ban 12 chemicals from being used in cosmetics in California. ""This bill, which passed in a bipartisan vote 7-0, will now go to the Appropriations Committee,"" announced Assemblyman Muratsuchi on Twitter. Today I presented my AB 2762 - the Toxic- Free Cosmetics Act - to the ESTM Committee. This bill, which passed in a bipartisan vote 7-0, will now go to the Appropriations Committee. Women deserve to know that their personal care products and cosmetics are toxic-free. — Asm. Al Muratsuchi (@AsmMuratsuchi) May 14, 2020 If adopted, the Act would ban 12 chemicals from cosmetics, including Dibutyl phthalate, diethylhexyl phthalate, formaldehyde, isobutylparaben, isopropylparaben, long chain PFAS chemicals, methylene glycol, mercury, paraformaldehyde, phenylenediamine, and quaternium-15. All these ingredients are already banned in the European Union and other regions. It will be possible to add new ingredients to this list when they have been identified after a stakeholder process and provided that they listed as a banned substance in Annex II of Regulation No. 1223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council or in any updates to that Annex. The Personal Care Products Council (PCPC), the most important national trade association representing the cosmetic and personal care products industry in the US, praised the move. ""We are proud to have joined a broad coalition, including the Black Women for Wellness, Breast Cancer Prevention Partners, CalPIRG and the Environmental Working Group, in supporting well-crafted, science-based reforms like AB 2762. Such legislation modernizes California's cosmetics regulation and also strengthens consumer confidence in the products they trust and enjoy every day,"" said the organization in a statement. A better alignment of cosmetics laws in the U.S. with the E.U. regulations has long been a key demand of consumer advocacy groups such as Environmental Working Group (EWG), Breast Cancer Prevention Partners, or Black Women for Wellness. Breast Cancer Prevention Partners, Black Women for Wellness ""Today's vote to ban 12 ingredients from cosmetics is just the first step in the legislative process. But this vote is an important milestone in the history of cosmetics regulation. For the first time, groups like EWG and the industry's trade association, the Personal Care Products Council, support legislation to modernize the rules governing these everyday products. Industry and consumer advocates agree that ingredients like formaldehyde and mercury have no place in cosmetics and other personal care products. This is good news for consumers, who should not have to worry about the presence of these chemicals, and good news for cosmetics companies, which benefit from greater harmony among global rules,"" said EWG President Ken Cook."
EU Commission's scientific body says aluminium is safe in cosmetics,"The CSSC's final opinion reiterates the terms of its preliminary opinion submitted for comments at the end of last year. The Committee - which gathers seventeen independent experts in chemistry and toxicology - considers that the use of aluminium compounds is safe at the following equivalent aluminium concentrations up to: – 6.25% in non-spray deodorants or non-spray antiperspirants, – 10.60% in spray deodorants or spray antiperspirants, – 2.65% in toothpaste and, – 0.77% in lipstick. Aluminium is a known systemic toxicant at high doses. Therefore, the safety of its use in cosmetics, especially in antiperspirants, has been the subject of numerous controversies and alarming media reports. Indeed, some studies have suggested that cosmetics may be a more important source of exposure than food. In 2011, based on an in vitro study evaluating the cutaneous absorption of aluminium, the French Health Products Safety Agency (Afssaps) recommended a re-evaluation of the risks linked to the use of this substance in cosmetics. In 2013, the risk assessment issued by the Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety concluded that the contribution of cosmetic products to the total systemic aluminium exposure was significantly larger than the contribution of diet. Those questions led to a previous SCCS opinion on aluminium in 2014. At that date, the Scientific Committee considered that there was a lack of adequate data, in particular regarding the dermal penetration of aluminium. The new opinion supplements and updates the previous opinion of 2014 taking into account the latest scientific data, in particular those obtained from three studies, two of them dating from 2020. According to the committee, recent studies show that aluminium is hardly absorbed by the skin, including freshly shaved skin, and is not stored in the skin. Therefore, the systemic exposure to aluminium via daily applications of cosmetic products ""does not add significantly"" to the systemic body burden of aluminium from other sources. According to the SCCS, exposure to aluminium may also occur from sources other than cosmetic products, in particular from the diet. ""The latest results show, among other things, that aluminium contained in antiperspirant products is neither absorbed nor stored by the skin. In addition, all the latest assessments and bibliographies carried out up to 2017 by other scientific committees have been reviewed and confirm that aluminium contained in cosmetic products does not has any role in breast cancer,"" comments FEBEA, the French Federation of Beauty Businesses, in a statement. The safety margin calculated by the SCCS - taking into account the different routes of exposure (oral, dermal, respiratory) linked to cosmetic products, is always greater than 2,000. This means that the amount of aluminium consumers are exposed to is, at least, 2,000 times lower than the dose identified as having no toxicological effects. This assessment has not taken into account the daily dietary intake of aluminium. According to Anne Dux, FEBEA's Scientific and Regulatory Affairs Director: ""This report puts an end to more than ten years of controversies that have generated anxiety among consumers using antiperspirant products. The European opinion, which has just been issued after an extremely rigorous procedure, gives users of such products the full assurance they are both safe and effective."""
Cruelty Free International helps Aussie beauty brands access China,"Highlights include seeing entire nations beyond the EU to ban the sale of newly animal-tested products including New Zealand, Switzerland and Turkey. The organization has also witnessed success with individual brands including Covergirl, which announced back in November that it is entirely cruelty-free, meaning none of its products or ingredients are tested on animals, nor are those of the brand's suppliers. Last week Cruelty-Free International CEO, Michelle Thew, hosted a presentation in Sydney, Australia - in collaboration with Covergirl - to show how the organization provides pioneering scientific and legal expertise to brands and governments. One current area of interest for the NGO is China, a country that has proven near-impossible for cruelty-free brands to access given its law that requires cosmetics to be tested on animals. In the past, beauty brands have used workarounds such as cross-border e-commerce (the Chinese law is only for brands that physically retail in the country), however, this option is handicapped by restricted cross-border spending limits. Back in 2018, Cruelty-Free International launched its Leaping Bunny China Pilot Program, which enables leaping bunny approved brands to enter the Chinese market without animal testing, for the first time. ""Historically it's not been possible for brands and it is still not possible to import directly to China. But our program makes use of the unique agreement we've struck with Shanghai Gengpu Industrial Park, Oriental Beauty Valley and Knudsen&CRC,"" Thew explained. ""This enables brands to make use of domestic manufacturing and then, supervised by us, launch onto the market."" Last month, UK men's skincare brand Bulldog was the first Leaping Bunny certified brand to reach the Mainland Chinese market. ""We want Australian brands to know this market is actually open to leaping bunny brands,"" she continued. ""If there are brands not currently selling in China who are interested in that market, they can talk to us about getting leaping bunny approval and joining the pilot program."" Michelle Thew hopes that the pilot program will significantly speed up overall regulatory changes in China. When it comes to the cruelty-free state of play in Australia, Thew believes there is still work to do. Earlier this year, however, the Australian Government committed to prohibiting reliance on animal test data for ingredients in cosmetics with introduction of the Industrial Chemicals Act 2019. From July 1 2020, the IC Act 2019 will give effect to the ban for ingredients used solely in cosmetics. ""This is an important signal from the Government,"" said Thew, ""it's very future-looking and it's very specific to cosmetics ingredients. We know that here in Australia there are a huge number of brands that have an organic, ethical feel so we know animal testing is also an interest of concern with Australian consumers."" Should any Australian beauty brand wish to know more about how the IC Act will impact them, Thew recommends getting in touch with Cruelty-Free International for advice on how to prepare."
"Proposed Natural Cosmetics Act aims to define ""natural cosmetics"" in the US","Introduced by Representative Sean Patrick Maloney from New York state and co-sponsored by Representative Grace Meng, also from New York, and Rep. Janice Schakowsky from Illinois, the Natural Cosmetics Act (H.R.5017) aims to define the terms ""natural"" and ""naturally-derived ingredient"" as they relate to personal care products. According to Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, falsely labeling products as ""natural"" does not qualify as misbranding and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) currently has almost no authority to take these products off the shelves. To date, no details are available regarding the exact content of the bill. However, according to Rep. Maloney, the bill requires cosmetic products sold, labeled, or represented as ""natural"" to contain at least 70 percent natural substances, excluding water. The bill would also require suppliers to conduct Carbon-14 testing which they must submit to manufacturers and would give the FDA authority to issue a cease distribution order, public notice on the FDA website, and voluntary recall authority of any product deemed misbranded under this act. ""Right now, the FDA doesn't consider it misbranding for companies to label products as 'natural,' even if they contain toxins like coal tar, asbestos, and other harmful chemicals. That's just not right,"" said Rep. Maloney. ""Increasing protections, transparency and oversight of personal care products is desperately needed. (…) All Americans deserve nothing less than full transparency and accountability from companies that market their products as 'natural.' I look forward to this important bill moving through the House, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it."" The bill is endorsed by clean beauty brand Beautycounter and its founder and CEO Gregg Renfrew. ""While words like 'natural' can signal a safer product, there are currently no industry standards. For years, Beautycounter has been asking Congress to create clear standards for marketing terms and so we are thrilled to support the Natural Cosmetics Act. This landmark bill sets clear and reasonable standards for companies who want to claim an ingredient or product is natural, while instilling confidence in today's savvy consumer."" Beyond the endorsement, Beautycounter is also mobilizing its base in support of the bill, including its clients and network of more than 45,000 Independent Consultants across all 50 states. Other brands such as BaboBotanicals and NakedPoppy also endorsed the bill, as well as biotech beauty ingredient maker Aprinnova and retailers Credo, Follain and Ivy Wild. According to Beautycounter, the natural beauty market accounts for $70 billion in the USA."
"Natural and organic cosmetics: A booming market and a legal fight about ""free from claims""","With a double-digit growth in 2018, sales of natural and organic cosmetics are the driving force behind the French market. With sales reaching a record 757 million euros in 2018, a leap of +18.7% compared to 2017, France is ranks second in Europe and third in the world, behind the United States, the world's largest market with a turnover of 4.32 billion euros, and Germany, the world's second market and the first European one, with 1.34 billion euros in 2018, according to figures published by Ecovia Intelligence. In France, natural and organic cosmetic products represent 6.4% of the total cosmetics market value. At the European level, sales of natural and organic cosmetics grew by +7.2% in 2018 compared to the previous year, and recorded an annual growth of +7% over the last five years, much more than the overall market. Sales of natural and organic cosmetics in Europe reached 3.82 billion euros in 2018 and are expected to reach 5 billion euros by 2023, an annual rate of about 6.3% per year, according to Ecovia Intelligence. In Europe, specialty stores dominate the natural and organic cosmetics market. Although their importance is decreasing, they still account for 38% of sales, ahead of pharmacies, parapharmacies and drugstores (33%). Mass general retailers account for 7% of sales of natural and organic cosmetic products, while other retail channels (perfumery shops, hairdressing salons, beauty salons, online sales, etc.) account for 23% of sales. In this context, Cosmébio, a trade association created in 2002 to speak on behalf the organic and natural cosmetics industry in France, demand that so-called ""free from claims"" be maintained to better inform consumers. Such claims have been prohibited by France's Autorité de Régulation Professionnelle de la Publicité (ARPP), the French advertising self-regulatory organization. ""Today, consumers no longer want certain ingredients to be in their daily beauty routines and the 'free from claims' help them to immediately spot the products that meet their expectations,"" the association said in a statement. Cosmébio criticizes ARPP, for having over-interpreted European law in a sense considered much too narrow. Indeed, according to the ARPP, claiming that a product is ""free from"" an ingredient that is authorised by the cosmetic regulation implies a denigrating message and such claims should therefore be prohibited. In particular, claims such as ""free from parabens"" or ""free from phenoxyethanol"" are under fire. According to Cosmébio, the ARPP's guidelines [1] do not have any binding value and rely on a technical document that is just an interpretation of the European law [2]. ""We cannot accept the way we promote our products to be imposed by a text that is not legally binding. Within Cosmebio, we remain convinced that 'free from claims' are a useful information for consumers. Consumers have the right to be able to quickly spot the products that do not contain unwanted ingredients, even when such ingredients are allowed by the regulations,"" said Romain Ruth, President of Cosmébio. On the other hand, those defending the prohibition of ""free from claims"" say that cosmetic products need a more ""positive communication"" that would ""contribute to a promote the image of the cosmetic products"". In practice, the market context could eventually work in favour of Cosmébio and of the other labels whose specifications prohibit controversial substances. Boosted by the consumer demand, the rise of the so-called clean cosmetics and the success of cosmetics apps are based on the implementation of black lists intended to reassure consumers. That is to say: ""Free from claims"" without explicitly writing them."
French and European authorities in disagreement about the safe use of phenoxyethanol on babies,"ANSM has requested for all non-rinsed cosmetic products containing phenoxyethanol to be labelled with the words ""do not use on the buttocks of infants less than three years."" [1]. Companies marketing these products will have a period of nine months (until December 20, 2019) to comply to this measure, which concerns all non-rinsed cosmetics containing phenoxyethanol, with the exception of deodorants, hair styling and make-up products. In practice, the text targets more particularly the wipes used to clean the nappy area of babies. Phenoxyethanol (or phenoxy-2-ethanol) is a germicidal and germistatic glycol ether commonly used as a preservative by the cosmetics industry. European regulations [2] require its concentration in cosmetics to be limited to 1% in the formulas of finished products. Suspected of reproductive toxicity, phenoxyethanol has been in the crosshairs of the French agency for several years now. In 2012, as a precautionary measure, the ANSM recommended not using this preservative in cosmetic products intended for the nappy area of babies and that its maximum authorised concentration threshold for use as a preservative should be lowered to 0.4% in cosmetic products for infants less than three years. Subsequently, in its opinion of October 2016 [3], the European Scientific Committee for Consumer Safety (SCCS) considered that phenoxyethanol used at 1% in cosmetic products was safe for use whatever the age group. In its decision taken ""as a precautionary measure, in order to guarantee the safe use of cosmetic products intended for infants"", the ANSM explains that it relied on ""new scientific data concerning exposure to phenoxyethanol"". After the publication of the opinion of the European scientific committee, the ANSM has indeed wished to continue its investigations and in 2017 formed a temporary specialized scientific committee (CSST) consisting of experts in toxicology, epidemiology, expology, dermatology and allergology with the aim of evaluating the advisability of maintaining its 2012 recommendations. These experts came to the conclusion that ""the 2012 recommendation for the non-use of phenoxyethanol in cosmetic products intended for the nappy area of babies should be maintained."" These experts also expressed the wish to extend this recommendation to all cleansing wipes, even those intended for adults, as they are frequently used to clean the buttocks young children. ""In all other cosmetic products intended for children less than three years, the maximum concentration of phenoxyethanol could remain at 1%."" The opinion of ANSM is therefore directly opposed to the EU's. In such a situation, Article 27 of the European Cosmetics Regulation [4] provides that the Agency will have to communicate to the Commission and the competent authorities of the other Member States any supporting data on which it bases its decision so as to determine, as soon as possible, whether the provisional measures are justified or not. COSMED and FEBEA, the professional trade associations defending the interests of French cosmetics manufacturers, have already indicated that they would use the various means of redress available to have the validity of the ANSM decision re-examined. The FEBEA has announced in particular its intention to refer this decision to the Conseil d'État (French highest administrative jurisdiction) for suspension and then cancellation. The FEBEA also asked Cosmetics Europe, the Brussels cosmetics industry lobby, to immediately refer the matter to the European Commission. On the eve of this legal battle, two scenarios are therefore to be considered: – Either the provisional measure decided by the French health authorities is considered groundless by the European authorities, in which case the Commission will inform the Member States and the ANSM will have to repeal its text without delay; – Either the French provisional measure is considered justified (probably after a new SCCS opinion is issued) in which case the European regulation will have to be modified. Whatever the outcome of the procedure, phenoxyethanol appears to be again in the hot seat. At a time when apps assessing the safety of cosmetic products are mushrooming, and 'clean beauty' being a buzzword in the cosmetics industry for some times, there is a fair chance that the days of this substance are already numbered, even though it is of interest to formulators."
No-deal Brexit: What should the cosmetics industry be preparing for?,"After the UK parliament's overwhelming rejection of Theresa May's Brexit deal, the French government considers a no-deal scenario as the most likely now. Therefore, French authorities have triggered a EUR 50 million (GBP 44 million) contingency plan to prepare the country's customs as well as the port and airport infrastructures. A no deal Brexit would see Britain leave the European Union without a formal agreement on the future trade relationship with member countries of the bloc. ""From one day to the next, without any transitional period, the United Kingdom will shift from EU Member State status to third country status. As far as trade is concerned, this will mean a shift to EU rules to WTO rules,"" warned Pierre Chabrol, Head of the Trade Policy, Strategy and Coordination Office at the French Ministry for the Economy and Finance. New rules will therefore apply to exports and imports to and from the United Kingdom. ""In such a situation, the measures taken by the administration cannot replace the necessary preparation of private businesses that are trading with the United Kingdom,"" he added before members of the cosmetics industry convened by the FEBEA on January 24 in Paris. From a general point of view, companies must quickly: – carry out a self-assessment of the impact of Brexit on their activity, – identify the measures to be taken, – check their supply chain and alert their subcontractors, – implement the measures identified. As far as the cosmetics industry is concerned, beyond additional customs procedures - for both imports and exports - which can seriously disrupt logistics flows, other issues need to be anticipated. Cosmetics companies must prepare to: – Appoint a Responsible Person in both the EU and the UK. ""As soon as the Brexit is effective, marketers of cosmetic products will need a Responsible Person in the UK for the products placed on this market,"" explains Olivia Santoni, Director, Regulatory and International Services de la Cosmetic, Toiletry & Perfumery Association (CTPA). – Update labels to feature an address in the UK for products from the EU and an address in the EU for UK products. However, for products placed on the British market, a transition period of 24 months is foreseen. – Re-make notifications to the CPNP (Cosmetic Product Notification Portal), since those made via the UK will no longer be valid after Brexit, and for EU companies notify the products to the new Bristish Portal. ""As far as cosmetics are concerned, we are fortunate to have a draft of the future regulation of the United Kingdom, [1]"" said Olivia Santoni. In particular, the new text no longer refers to the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS). In the future, the status of ingredients will be decided at UK level. If it is not yet certain, the no-deal scenario must be seriously considered and companies cannot wait to prepare."
"Brexit: ""We need to get ready for a no-deal exit""","""The UK's exit is enacted. The question is, will there be an agreement with a transitional period or a brutal separation? The first solution would give everyone more time,"" explains Virginie D'Enfert, FEBEA's VP of Economic, International, and Environmental Affairs. Since Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union was implemented, on March 29, 2017, the UK and the EU have been trying to agree on the terms of their separation scheduled for March 29, 2019. In the event of a deal, an 18-month transitional period will allow for a ""soft"" exit, since the EU law will apply in the UK until December 31, 2020. Unfortunately, if many points are resolved, a number of issues are still preventing a final compromise, in particular the Irish border. If these difficulties are not overcome, there will be no deal (""Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed""), and there will be no transitional period. And as D-Day is approaching, this hypothesis is getting more and more plausible. ""Companies should get ready for a possible hard Brexit, which would definitely not offer any period of adaptation,"" warns Olivia Santoni, Director of Regulatory and International Services of the CTPA. Of course, an extension of negotiations can be considered, but this additional period of time would be short: it would not go beyond the May 2019 European elections. As soon as the divorce is pronounced, the UK will become a ""third country"". Starting from March 29, 2019, in the event of a hard Brexit or at the end of the transitional period, if there is a deal, the European regulations will no longer apply in the UK, which will also be out of the Customs Union. As a result, for cosmetics companies [1], there is an urgent need to prepare for the worst-case scenario, i.e. for: – The obligation to appoint a Responsible Person in both the EU and the UK. – Updating labels to feature the two Responsible Persons' addresses and the exact product origin since the UK will be a third country. Let's remind that ""made in EU"" is not accepted by customs authorities outside the Union. – Re-making notifications on the CPNP (Cosmetic Product Notification Portal), since those made via the UK will no longer be valid (it should be possible to create drafts). – Making notifications on the future British portal. – Having to pay customs duties on materials and goods crossing the Channel one way or the other. – Increased transit costs and complexity, and delays due to customs procedures all along the supply chain. Beyond the European Cosmetics Regulation, other regulations will have to be translated into English law, including REACH and CLP. However, Brexit will create no legal vacuum. At first, the British will use the original European legislation by replacing the words ""European Union"" by ""United Kingdom"", where needed, as soon as 2019, in case of a no-deal Brexit, and at the end of the transitional period, if there is a deal. But once this phase is over, the UK will regain control of its legislation – which is what Brexit supporters want. No doubt they will copy the better part of the European legislation, but in the long run, there will be inevitable divergences. Ideally, cosmetics manufacturers on both sides of the Channel would have preferred deals specific to their own sector to maintain British participation in a few European agencies, like ECHA, the European Chemicals Agency, and avoid any duplications. But the details of the future relationship between the UK and the EU will only be discussed after a deal on the exit – which just cannot be found yet. Right now, the negotiation process is horizontal, not sector-based, and unsurprisingly, both parties have opposed ambitions and interests. When the British seek a tailor-made status that best meet their interests, the Europeans try to avoid cherry-picking, which would lead to the UK only taking part in – and financing – the agencies and policies they are interested in. As the third cosmetics market in the EU, behind Germany and France, and ahead of Italy, the UK is also one of France's major trading partners: in 2017, France exported 996 million cosmetics across the Channel (the UK is the French industry's third client, after the US and Germany). This issue is obviously not trivial."
Brazil: ANVISA agrees to simplify the regulations of cosmetics for children,"The regulatory move is a consequence of the public consultation on the technical and administrative requirements applicable toiletries, cosmetics and perfumes placed on the Brazilian market. ""The main change resulting from the public consultation is the migration of children's products from compulsory registration to registration exemption. The only products remaining subject to registration are: sunscreens, insect repellents, hair straighteners and antiseptic gels for the hands. The move will not put children at risk. These products are considered as low risk and, in most parts of the world, registration is not required,"" said João Tavares Neto, Manager of the Hygiene, Perfume, Cosmetic and Sanitation Products Directorate (GHCOS) at ANVISA. According to ABIHPEC, the regulatory change does not alter efficacy and safety requirements but reduces bureaucracy thus enhancing innovation. ""This breakthrough is very important for providing consumers with an increased access to key health products; and for the Brazilian personal care industry, which will enjoy a greater predictability for the launch of new products. We are making progress in simplifying administrative processes and gradually putting the sector in line with the more advanced countries in relation to low risk products,"" said Renata Amaral, manager of Technical and Regulatory Affairs at ABIHPEC. According to ANVISA's Board of Directors, the change in the RDC 07/2015 reinforces the need to increase in-market control. As required by Brazilian law since 1976, it is the responsibility of the manufacturer to comply with all the rules and regulations and to carry out all the tests to place safe products on the market. The improvement of the procedure for regulating Children's Products only refers to an administrative change, this means that all the technical requirements provided by RDC 15/15 will not be modified."
Nanoparticles: What is the meaning of the complaint of the French consumer watchdog?,"UFC-Que Choisir has analysed 16 consumer food and cosmetics products for nanoparticles of titanium dioxide, but also silicon dioxide, iron and zinc oxides (dyes). As a result, according to the consumer association, ""100% of products analysed contain nanoparticles."" While, only three products mentioned them on their label. Applying the name and shame method, the Association unveiled the names of the products concerned, among which, M&M's Peanuts (Mars), the toothpaste Aquafresh triple protection+blancheur ( GlaxoSmithKline), the deodorant Sanex Natur protect 48h (Colgate-Palmolive), or Avène's Cold Cream nourishing lip balm (Pierre Fabre Group). UFC-Que Choisir has also lodged a complaint in Paris against nine manufacturers [1], which it accuses of knowingly concealing the presence of these substances. Consumer associations have long been concerned about the presence of these nanoparticles in consumer products. The publication in January 2017 of a study confirming that chronic (oral) ingestion of titanium dioxide (TiO2) could contribute to the growth of precancerous lesions in rats has reinforced these fears. [2] Identified by the food industry under the code E171, Titanium Dioxide is an additive used to whiten and intensify the shine of sweets or of some pastries. It is also used by the pharmaceutical industry and in cosmetics, more particularly in toothpastes and sunscreens. To respond to the concerns of NGOs, the government had announced at the end of August the reinforcement of controls by the DGCCRF (fraud control). The results of these tests showed that 87% of the 40 cosmetics and 39% of the 74 food products analysed contained nanoparticles. But ""only one product mentioned, on its labelling, the presence of all identified nanomaterials"", according to the Ministry of Economy. ""The procedure asking manufacturers of these products to comply, is pending,"" indicated to the AFP Alexandre Chevallier, Deputy Head of Office at the DGCCRF, also ensuring that investigations would continue in 2018. At this stage, however, the supervisory Bodies shall refrain from any legal proceedings. Indeed, just because nanoparticles are found in a product does not mean they were voluntarily introduced by manufacturers. Many substances naturally contain nanoparticles. ""This is why the European Regulation only requires their labelling under two conditions: It has to be manufactured intentionally, i.e., when more than 50% of it is present in an ingredient, and it must be insoluble or bio-persistent,"" Anne Dux told the AFP. While the DGCCRF prides itself on having ""developed innovative methods of analysis"", the issue at hand concerning the detection of nanoparticles is very complex. Certain techniques, such as electron microscopic analysis, can break apart molecular aggregates and reveal nanoparticles where there were none before. Others techniques can have the opposite effect. Some analyses conducted by the DGCCRF were for example unable to detect the presence of carbon black in a nano form in a product that mentioned it on its labelling! The reactions of companies concerned are mixed. Indeed, it is a thorny issue to address. To avoid problems some of them have already decided to give up the use of TiO2. ""We are well aware of the issue raised by UFC-Que Choisir,"" responded the Casino Group, ensuring that it had engaged in steps with the supplier of an additive present in a soup, towards its removal. ""This will be effective in the coming weeks,"" emphasised the Group. Mars Chocolat France officials assured that their products complied with ""all regulations in force"", while underlining that the phase-out plan for TiO2, which was decided to meet consumers' preferences for more natural ingredients, was a ""priority"". For its part, the Avène brand (Pierre Fabre Group) asked the UFC-Que Choisir Association to have some details on the methodology used in tests. ""Our Cold Cream lip balm does not contain nanomaterials as defined by European cosmetic Regulations, as shown by the certificates given to us by our raw material suppliers,"" underlined Avène officials. In summary, complaints from UFC-Que Choisir are probably more indicative of the flaws in the methods of analysis than of a supposed lack of transparency from the industry. This probably explains why, for its part, the DGCCRF did not find it appropriate to prosecute. Supervisory Bodies have access to the technical files of products that must contain all the data on the ingredients used and their suppliers. To date, it seems that controlling this file remains the best way to detect a possible fraud."
Natural and organic cosmetics: The new ISO standard continues to be debated,"Like all ISO standards, the aim was to reach consensus among the various stakeholders to best meet expectations of brands and consumers. The standard attempts to establish common definitions and calculation bases, internationally recognized, to determine the minimum level of organic and natural ingredients required in the composition of cosmetics with such claims. The result of a compromise, the standard was criticized by historic labels who disagreed on several points. Through the voice of its Director Valérie Lemaire, the Ecocert Greenlife Group - the world's leading certifying body of natural and organic cosmetics, based chiefly on the specifications of the European label COSMOS - disagrees on three points: the definition of natural ingredients, and the minimum percentage calculation required for organic ingredients and natural ingredients. ""It's a standard of calculation and to make these calculations, definitions were necessary, but we don't agree on these definitions,"" explains firstly Valérie Lemaire. For Anne Dux, Director of Scientific and Regulatory Affairs at FEBEA, the French trade association representing the cosmetics industry, ""the ISO 16128 standard represents an international consensus, which cannot limit itself to the position of various European private labels"". For the industry, the standard has the advantage of offering an international standard serving as a global reference without however replacing national or regional specifications of various labels. The first point of disagreement concerns the definition of natural ingredients, which specifies that according to the specifications of the COSMOS label, a natural ingredient cannot be qualified as such from the moment it originates from a plant that has undergone genetic transformation. On this point, the ISO 16128 standard specifies that ""GMOs are only allowed in the regions of the world that authorize them"". In theory, they should not be allowed in the European Union. However, according to Valérie Lemaire, it is commonplace that ingredient manufacturers in France or Europe supply themselves with plants originating from areas of the world where GMOs are allowed. ""Today, corn and soy are almost systematically sourced from the United States, and therefore are 100% GM, however ingredients originating from them will be described as natural,"" she adds. On the other hand, organic ingredients should not be concerned, since they cannot be certified organic in Europe if they come from a GM plant. The second sticking point concerns the percentage calculation of ingredients of biological origin. Anne Dux stresses on the fact that ""the standard does not enable an industrialist to claim that his product is organic, but more to guarantee that it incorporates a certain percentage of organic ingredients."" To this end, the standard provides for the calculation of the ratio of organic ingredients introduced at the beginning of the product's manufacturing process. This calculation at the beginning of the manufacturing process puzzles Valérie Lemaire. She considers that the mode of transformation of the product is not taken into account to validate the biological index. ""A manufacturer can very well start with a certified organic ingredient and then add a solvent or petrochemical molecules. Once the formula is transformed, the biological molecule is completely modified and will be mixed. This ingredient, which however no longer respects the principles of organic farming, will be valued in a percentage of ingredients of biological origin,"" she says. An issue that she also raises for the calculation of the natural origin as well as for the resulting claims. This is the third point of concern. ""Today any product on the market may claim having a percentage of natural origin, for example surfactants are plant derived, but during the transformation process, some far from green petrochemicals can come into play. It is therefore a wide open door for having claims on all products and for consumers to be completely misled,"" she explains. ""It's impugning motives"", answers Anne Dux who, on the contrary, sees in the standard an opportunity to simplify things for consumers often confronted to the diversity and contradiction of labels. Does the solution lie in a better control of environmental claims, similar to what is done in France? This point, in contrast, seems to have reached consensus."
Scientists recommend avoiding the use of triclosan and triclocarban in consumer products,"The news comes after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced last year that 19 different antimicrobial chemicals, including triclosan and triclocarban, were not effective and should not be used in over-the-counter consumer hygiene products. However, the scientists behind the report say the FDA's decision does not go far enough. ""I was happy that the FDA finally acted to remove these chemicals from soaps. But I was dismayed to discover at my local drugstore that most products now contain substitutes that may be worse,"" said Arlene Blum of Green Science Policy Institute. In addition to being used in soaps and hygiene products, antimicrobials are found in a variety of everyday products including paints, exercise mats, flooring, apparel, food storage containers, home textiles, electronics, kitchenware, school supplies, and countertops. Although the report acknowledges that antimicrobials can be useful in certain products, such as paint, they also point out that any health claims about products with antimicrobials are largely invalid. ""In personal care products like hand soap, there is no evidence that use of triclosan or triclocarban improves consumer or patient health or prevents disease,"" claim the scientists behind the statement. The scientists add that triclosan or triclocarban ""are source of toxic and carcinogenic compounds"", ""have detrimental effects on aquatic organisms"", ""are endocrine disruptor"". Furthermore, overusing these substances ""may contribute to antibiotic/antimicrobial resistance and may modify the microbiome."" Despite this, sales of products marketed with antimicrobials are expected to rise. ""Customers may think added antimicrobials are a way to reduce infections, but in most products there is no evidence that they do,"" said Ted Schettler of the Science and Environmental Health Network. ""People think antimicrobial hand soaps offer better protection against illness. But generally, antimicrobial soaps perform no better than plain soap and water,"" added Barbara Sattler from the University of San Francisco. The reports by the scientists concluded that non-medical uses of antimicrobials should be reduced, with Rolf Halden at Arizona State University explaining that, ""Environmental and human exposures to triclosan and triclocarban are widespread, affecting pregnant women, developing fetuses, and breastfeeding babies. We must develop better alternatives and prevent unneeded exposures to antimicrobial chemicals."" The statement was published while the FDA is in a multi-year process of establishing a new Healthcare Antiseptic Monograph, which regulates the use of most antiseptic hand hygiene agents in healthcare settings, including what are commonly known as antibacterial soaps, hand sanitizers and pre-operative scrubs."
"Sunscreens and aluminium salts, the FEBEA takes the floor","The first themes addressed at the workshop led by Anne Dux, Director of Scientific and Regulatory Affairs, concerned issues related to sunscreens and deodorants. First finding: only one French out of four bought suncare products in 2016, (26.5% exactly), for an average of 1.6 product per year. It is not much, especially considering that skin cancer is making progress and is one of the top three cancers in the world [1]. The often high price of suncare products, could explain the lack of interest of French people for sunscreens, a public health issue. ""Products are expensive because filters are expensive,"" explained Anne Dux. Filters, – key components of the product –, their quality, performance, relevance and environmental impact are at the heart of issues. To be efficient a suncare product generally uses two types of filters to protect the skin against UVAs and UVBs: mineral filters, playing the role of sunray reflectors like a mirror, and organic filters that absorb UVs. Some manufacturers are questioning the need of adding IR filters (against infrareds) in sunscreen formulas. ""We do not recommend their use, because these rays impart a sensation of heat on the skin, protecting himself from IRs will encourage the user to stay longer in the sun or to expose himself during the hottest hours of the day,"" emphasised Anne Dux. There is currently a debate going on about the evaluation of the protective effect of sunscreens. According to the FEBEA, concerning SPFs (sun protection factor), which measures the protection against UVBs, only in vivo measurements, i.e., on human volunteers, are reliable. However, this poses an ethical problem, while in vitro results are more uncertain. ""In terms of innovation, improvements both in efficiency measurements and in the development of more eco-friendly filters are expected. Maybe with the introduction of natural filters, which so far, lack efficiency, or with formulas minimizing the presence of filters,"" assured Anne Dux. Because the other much debated issue on sunscreens is their environmental impact on wildlife and marine life. ""Yet, there is no scientific evidence of this impact"", according to the specialist. Mineral filters are deposited on the ocean floor and do not degrade. But as far as pollution is concerned, sunscreens are not the biggest polluters in the field, way behind industrial paints. Finally Anne Dux recalled that at present, the EU regulation was one of the safest in the world concerning suncare products. There is currently In Europe a list of 25 modern filters authorized, while in the United States this list, regulated by the FDA has not been updated since 1974. It only has 9 authorized filters, hence old generation filters. ""This creates a real burden for U.S. and international companies, and a lack of safety for consumers,"" she concluded. The speaker focused on recalling the differences in their mechanism of action and therefore their composition. Deodorants fight against perspiration odours by using agents and perfumes that limit bacterial growth. Aluminium salts, which have been in the hot seat for many years due to a possible link with breast cancer, are present in antiperspirant products to block sweat excretion from sweat glands. Anne Dux looked back on the issue concerning these aluminium salts recalling that aluminium was present everywhere in our environment without impacting the organism because it did not cross the skin or digestive barrier. Adding that, no reliable study proved so far that these aluminium salts could cross the skin barrier and justify the presence of the substance in the ganglia of women with the disease. ""In all logic, if the link between deodorants and breast cancer was established, it would then cause bilateral cancers and also affect men. There is no conclusive study on the crossing of the skin barrier. The recommendations of the AFSSAPS (French Agency for the Safety of Health Products) are based on invalid tests because they were performed in an environment charged with aluminium,"" commented Anne Dux. A new in vivo study is underway on which the SCCS (Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety) will soon take position."
Brazil: Anvisa updates definition and labelling rules for sun products,"The purpose of the regulation was to complement and to clarify existing technical requirements and to fill in gaps in the definitions of these products. According to Anvisa, these gaps were generated by the repeal of Decree 79094, dated January 5, 1977, in August 2013. The Agency provides the following definitions: A sunscreen (bronzeador) is a cosmetic preparation intended to come into contact with the skin, with the sole or principal purpose of protecting it against UVB and UVA radiations without, however, preventing the tanning action of the sun. A self-tanning (bronzeador simulatório) is the cosmetic that darkens the skin by external application, regardless exposure to solar radiation, it shall be dermatologically innocuous and free of irritating or photosensitizing substances. A tan activator or accelerator (ativador/acelerador de bronzeado) is intended to promote the darkening of the skin by external application, it shall be dermatologically innocuous, and free of irritating or photosensitizing substances. The procedures for the regularization of these products with the Anvisa remain unchanged and must comply with the requirements established in regulation RDC No. 7/2015, that is to say that sunscreens are subject to registration, while self-tanning products and tan activators or accelerators are exempt from registration. Furthermore, sunscreens shall also comply with the requirements of the regulation RDC No. 30/2012. As far as labelling is concerned, companies that already have tan activators or accelerators listed with the Anvisa have 180 days to update the labelling of the products, which shall now display on both the primary and secondary packaging, the words: ""This product is not a sun protector,"" (Este produto não é um protetor solar,)in addition to the warnings already required by regulation RDC No. 7/2015."
Zinc oxide makes official entry into the list of UV filters approved in the EU,"Following a vote by member states in the EU Commission Working Group on Cosmetics in October last year, zinc oxide in both its nano and non-nano forms has now been added officially to the list of UV filters allowed for use in cosmetic products. Being known for decades for its beneficial properties as skin protectant and its antimicrobial activity, zinc oxide is one of only two UV filters approved for UVA1 protection in sun care applications in the US. According to Regulation (EU) 2016/621 of 21 April 2016, amending Annex VI to the Cosmetics Regulation [1], both the nano and non-nano forms will be authorized for use at a maximum concentration of 25%, except in applications that may lead to exposure of the consumer's lungs by inhalation. Therefore, the use in an aerosol sunspray would not be allowed as part of the formulation could be unwittingly inspired. Furthermore, only the nano forms meeting the criteria mentioned in the annex of the regulation - including particle size, morphology, purity and solubility - are allowed. This modification to the Cosmetics Regulation is effective on May 11, 2016. Suppliers of these substances applaud the move, which will widen formulation options for products aimed at filtering UV rays. ""The formal approval of new options to achieve effective UVA and UVB protection is a major milestone for formulators of UV protection products. Having a wider choice of globally approved filters enables brands to meet consumer needs more easily,"" said Helene Hine, Marketing Manager at Croda. The company offers a range of zinc oxide dispersions under their Solaveil Clarus brand, Solaveil CZ-100 and Solaveil CZ-300. ""UV radiation is responsible for various physiological effects in the skin. These include sunburn, premature appearance of wrinkles and - with frequent intensive exposure - an increased risk of skin cancer. Each approval of a UV filter offers new options and a wider choice for formulators of sun care products to provide vital protection for the skin against these harmful effects of UV radiation,"" also said Dirk Mampe, BASF's Head of Business Management for Personal Care Specialties in Europe. BASF offers zinc oxide - with and without coating - under its Z-Cote brand. The EU may soon approve other nano UV filters. In February 2016, titanium dioxide has received a positive vote by the EU Commission Working Group on Cosmetics. The official entry of the nano UV filter into Annex VI of the EU Cosmetics Regulation is expected for the second half of 2016. Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutyl-phenol (MBBT) is still on the voting list. In 2015, the Scientific Committee for Consumer Safety (SCCS) published a positive scientific opinion on MBBT in nano form. Its official entry into Annex VI is anticipated for 2017. Both titanium dioxide and MBBT were already approved as UV filters and have been used in sunscreens for years. However, a new approval as ""nano"" was required due to the new EU Cosmetics Regulation."
Audit of cosmetics advertising practices shows high compliance level,"The European Regulation on the justification of claims used in relation to cosmetic products [1] and the guidelines and recommendations adopted by the cosmetics industry [2] to regulate its advertising practices are well followed. This is the conclusion of the audit conducted, upon the request of Cosmetics Europe, by the European Advertising Standards Alliance (EASA) - a non-profit organisation based in Brussels, which brings together national advertising self-regulatory organisations. The audit, which was conducted across six representative European countries (France, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Sweden and UK), also checked the compliance of advertisements against the national self-regulatory advertising codes and laws. Results are very positive for the European cosmetics industry. Indeed, EASA's audit report finds that 91% of the advertisements of cosmetic products were in compliance with all relevant advertising codes/laws. A total of 1,861 advertisements were reviewed, including 577 television and 1,284 print advertisements aired/published over three month periods - September 2014, March and June 2015. Only 6% of the advertisements were found to be in breach of relevant advertising codes/laws while 3% of the advertisements could not be assessed, as the experts did not receive the information necessary to assess the compliance of the claims made in the advertisements. Poland and France reported the highest compliance rates with 98% and 95% respectively. The compliance rates in Sweden (89%), UK (87%), Hungary (86%) and Italy (83%) showed in comparison a lower compliance rate. ""The high level of compliance found in the EASA report highlights the effectiveness of self-regulation by the industry and the vital role it plays as a component of the overall EU policy and regulatory system for cosmetics advertising; the system works well! Nevertheless, our industry is not complacent. Cosmetics Europe is committed to promote continuous improvement of industry's advertising practices, through compliance with the regulatory and self-regulatory framework and will seek to take learnings from the results of the EASA audit for the future,"" said Loïc Armand, President of Cosmetics Europe. The main issue identified with the 6% of advertisements found to be in breach was misleading advertising followed by social responsibility, health and safety and taste and decency. Misleading advertising mainly concerned unsubstantiated claims and health/medical claims. Other misleading issues flagged by the experts were related to: claims regarding legal requirements, claims related to studies/tests, denigration of the use of ingredients that are legal to use, testimonials, promotions with no expiration date, misleading imagery and comparative advertising; Finally, let's note that 97% of the television advertisements were considered as compliant with all relevant advertising codes/laws while only 88% of the print advertisements were considered as compliant."
Cosmetics under fire: What is the impact on consumers and the industry?,"The last few weeks have been rough for cosmetic manufacturers. The safety of their products, which is a regulatory requirement, has come under fire. Charges have multiplied with cosmetics successively accused to pollute indoor air, to contain substances potentially harmful for babies or for everybody… Each time, the industry tried to respond. Regarding indoor air quality, the Cosmetic, Toiletry & Perfumery Association (CTPA) explained that media reports linking the use of personal care products and harmful indoor air quality were ""based on a misrepresentation"" of a report issued by the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. Indeed, the report is very clear, when it comes to the quality of indoor air, as few substances such as cigarette smoke and carbon monoxide are pointed out as very serious hazards. While personal care products may contain VOCs, the report clearly says: ""Although they are very common in the air, their health effects are generally minor."" Similarly, the French Federation of Cosmetics Makers (Fédération des entreprises de la beauté - FEBEA) immediately responded to the publication of the reports from Women in Europe for a Common Future (WECF) and UFC-Que Choisir. As far as baby products are concerned, FEBEA reminded that all cosmetic products marketed in Europe are subject to a safety assessment and that specific and reinforced procedures apply to cosmetic products intended for children under three years of age. It is the same for substances in the products. When a potentially hazardous substance is identified, the European Commission may, where appropriate, prohibit or limit its use to ensure that it presents no hazard. ""For the scientific authorities, there is no question of accepting that legislation would not be up to date,"" highlights the Federation. For several years, the representatives of the cosmetics industry have also created websites to provide answers to consumer concerns: ParlonsCosmetiques.com in France, The Facts About Cosmetic Products in the United Kingdom, and CosmeticsInfo.org in the United States. However, one must admit that the industry's arguments hardly emerge from the mass of scaring stories. It is likely that the opinions of cosmetics makers are regarded with suspicion due to their supposed bias. But when whistle-blowers themselves temperate their previous affirmation, or the way they were interpreted, they face the same difficulties. UFC-Que Choisir has just published a new article strongly moderating some of the conclusions that were drawn from its previous report (in French). Let's bet it will not make much ado. In this case, the media mechanics are to blame. In a basic economic calculation, media tend to prefer sensational news generating high audience levels (or a lot of clicks) rather than complex and costly investigations that are much less impactful. Moreover, the behaviour of cosmetics makers, which are eager to maximize sales, does not always help to clarify things. When consumers began to be suspicious about parabens, many brands have seen it as a business opportunity, either because they never used parabens, as for natural or organic brands, or because they were able to quickly reformulate their products. The ""paraben-free"" claim becoming a commercial argument, it confirmed consumers' worries. Despite the lack of conclusive studies and despite (or because of) frequent confusions between different types of molecules, the arguments of experts defending parabens have fallen flat. Today, among the substances blamed for their potentially harmful effects are materials such as methylisothiazolinone (MIT), which have been used to replace parabens. History repeats itself and scaring stories about endocrine disruptors in cosmetics are leading to the emergence on the marketi of cosmetics claiming to be ""free from endocrine disruptors"". [1] For Celine Couteau and Laurence Coiffard, who teach cosmetology at the University of Nantes' Faculty of Pharmacy, these alarming reports mix very different things. In a recent opinion paper (in French) the two scientists criticized ""excessively scaring information"" that ""creates confusion between irritating molecules, allergens and endocrine disruptors."" Legitimate criticism about the honesty of so-called hypoallergenic products containing well-known allergens (such as MCI and MIT), are placed alongside questions on possible endocrine disruptors, for which there is no scientific consensus. Such confusion greatly complicates the response from the industry. ""Different and incomparable things are placed at the same level,"" Céline Couteau told Premium Beauty News. ""It is as absurd as to say that a food market is full of allergenic products such as strawberries or photo-sensitizers such as celery."" Will consumers eventually benefit from these polemics? It is very unlikely according to Céline Couteau. ""In my opinion, it is not in the interest of consumers to cry wolf constantly. This can lead to remove molecules that are not perfect but that have a very well known spectrum. The risk is that they are replaced by apparently less problematic substances for which we actually lack of detailed information."" Meanwhile consumers seem rather puzzled. According to a recent survey by Toluna for the magazine Challenges, nearly a quarter (24.8%) of respondents in France believe that the safety of products sold in supermarkets is declining, but a half believe that it remains stable and 18.8% that it improves! ""These scandals reinforce the suspicion from the most pessimistic consumers towards products,"" Philippe Guilbert, CEO of Toluna, told Premium Beauty News. ""We also note that certifications still play a key role to reassure consumers, even if occasionally they may fail to guarantee full product quality."" What conclusions can be drawn from all of that? One can certainly note the paradox of multiplying alerts in an increasingly stringent regulatory environment. But one must admit that safety requirements are becoming stronger and that the succession of scandals even areas not related to cosmetics - such as pharmaceuticals or food - tends to increase the defiance of consumers regarding the industry in general. The trend towards more natural products will certainly continue, although natural and organic cosmetics are far from being beyond reproach. However, consumers do not panic, they are suspicious but still measured in their conclusions. One of the main challenges is certainly to allow the emergence of independent and expert voices, which could translate complex scientific facts into nuanced and well-argued analyses understandable by the general public. From this point of view, web and social media cannot be perceived as just dangerous. Many talented bloggers and vloggers have demonstrated their ability to build bridges between consumers and scientists. Just read, for instance, the interesting posts from French bloggers Capucine Piot (in French) and Sophie Strobel (in French)."
USA: Ban on microplastic beans in rinsed-off cosmetics,"The Microbead-Free Waters Act of 2015 prohibits ""the manufacture and introduction into interstate commerce of rinse-off cosmetics containing intentionally-added plastic microbeads."" The Bill (H.R. 1321) was co-sponsored by both Republican and Democrat congressmen and passed the U.S. House on December 7 and the Senate on December 18, 2015. According to the law, the term ""plastic microbeads"" means ""any solid plastic particle that is less than five millimetres in size and is intended to be used to exfoliate or cleanse the human body or any part thereof."" The text also includes toothpastes within the rinse-off cosmetic category concerned by the ban. The new law will phase microbeads out of consumer products over the next few years, starting with a ban on manufacturing the beads beginning on the July 1, 2017, followed by the ban on sales on July 1, 2018. However, in the case of a rinse-off cosmetic that is also a non-prescription drug, the ban on manufacturing will begin on July 1, 2018, and the ban on sale on July 1, 2019. The Personal Care Products Council applauded the new law ""which creates a planned and pragmatic national phase-out process in the interest of both consumers and the industry."" Legislations prohibiting microbeads particles in cosmetic products were already passed in several U.S. States. The new law ""is aimed at the proliferation of conflicting state and local restrictions that create unnecessary disruption and confusion for both consumers and companies,"" said Lezlee Westine, President and CEO of the Personal Care Products Council. The persistence of plastic debris in the marine environment and waterways is an issue of increasing public debate. In Europe, Cosmetics Europe, the European personal care association has issued recommendation to discontinue their use in wash off cosmetic and personal care products as of 2020."
North America on the way to ban plastic microbeads in cosmetics,"With the recent adoption on June 29 by the Connecticut legislature of a number of items as budget implementers including a ban of plastic microbeads used in cosmetics and personal care products, the prospect of a general ban in North America gained ground. The text prohibits the manufacture of personal care products - with the exception of over-the-counter drugs - containing synthetic solid microbeads from December 31, 2017. It also prohibits the importation of such products from December 31, 2018. Several other states have already passed similar laws or are considering their adoption. The list of states that have passed a ban or discussing this issue includes California, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, New Jersey, New York and Wisconsin. In New Jersey, for instance, Governor Chris Christie signed the legislation (S2178) into law on March 2015, after having vetoed an earlier version of the law in December 2014. On the 1st of May 2015, Congressman Fred Upton and members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Health held the first legislative hearing on H.R. 1321, the Microbead-Free Waters Act of 2015. This bipartisan bill, authored by representative and Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone, would require the Food and Drug Administration to prohibit the sale or distribution of personal care products containing plastic microbeads by January 1, 2018. A Federal legislation would have the advantage to establish a national standard to protect the environment and therefore ensure that manufacturers do not face a patchwork of State laws. In Canada, the House of Commons unanimously voted a proposition from the New Democratic Party (NDP) to add microbeads to the list of toxic substances managed by the government under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. The NDP initiative has received support from many people across the country, NGOs and the Canadian Cosmetics, Toiletry and Fragrances Association. A public petition on Change.org has gathered over 30,000 signatures in a few short months. All these legislative initiatives show a clear direction and it is quite reasonable to expect that a ban on plastic microbeads in cosmetics will be effective across the North American continent around January 2018."
USA: What's in the Personal Care Products Safety Act ?,"For several years, the Personal Care Products Council (PCPC), the trade organization which represents the leading producers of cosmetic and personal care products in the United States, has expressed its support to strengthening FDA oversight of these products. However, the organization's position proved difficult to conciliate with those of consumer advocacy organizations. Having support from all stakeholders is certainly the main asset of the text proposed by Senators Feinstein and Collins, which is the result of numerous discussions and extensive consultations. [1] The bill requires FDA to review chemicals used in cosmetic products and provide clear guidance on their safety. A minimum of five ingredients per year would be evaluate to determine their safety and appropriate use. The first set of chemicals for review includes: – Diazolidinyl urea, which is used as a preservative in a wide range of products including deodorant, shampoo, conditioner, bubble bath and lotion. – Lead acetate, which is used as a colour additive in hair dyes. – Methylene glycol/formaldehyde, which is used in hair treatments. – Propyl paraben, which is used as a preservative in a wide range of products including shampoo, conditioner and lotion. – Quaternium-15, which is used as a preservative in a wide range of products including shampoo, shaving cream, skin creams and cleansers The Personal Care Products Safety Act would also: – Provide the FDA the authority to order recalls of certain personal care products that threaten consumer safety. – Provide the FDA the authority to require labelling of products that include ingredients not appropriate for children and those that should be professionally administered. – Require complete label information, including ingredients and product warnings, to be posted online since many personal care products are purchased over the Internet. – Require companies to provide contact information on their products for consumers and report serious adverse events to the FDA within 15 days, including death, hospitalization and disfigurement. Health effects that could have resulted in hospitalization without early intervention would also be required to be reported. – Require manufacturers to register annually with the FDA and provide the agency with information on the ingredients used in their personal care products. – Direct the FDA to issue regulations on Good Manufacturing Practices for personal care products. – Encourage the use of alternative testing methods that provide information that is equivalent or superior in scientific quality to the animal testing method. The bill is available here below or on Senator Feinstein's website."
"UEAPME, IFRA and Cosmebio recommend a pragmatic approach to labelling of fragrance allergens","The possible addition of tens of fragrance components to the current list of 26 allergens that must be labelled on cosmetic products is a source of concerns for the whole cosmetics industry and in particular for SMEs. According to IFRA and the two other trade organisations, efficient and relevant information must be provided to people suffering from skin allergy, this information must be provided before choosing to use a cosmetic product containing certain skin sensitizers, it must be straightforward and easily accessible, as well as rigorously identical across the industry and proportionate, and manageable by all concerned in the supply chain. ""Given the intrinsic nature of elicitation thresholds to each individual, it is essential that the way in which the information is structured helps each individual tailor his management of the risk under consideration,"" explain the three organisations. According to the trade bodies, a hybrid informative approach combining ""several tools such as pictograms, on-pack warnings, web sites and toll free access to consumer help centres,"" would be the best way to address all the efficiency, proportionality and manageability pre-requisites. They recommend adding 12 ""allergens of concern"" (as enumerated in table 13.5 of the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety opinion [1]) to the list of substances that must be labelled on the external packaging of cosmetic products. ""These substances are the ones frequently prevalent in the reported cases of skin allergies"", they say. For all other substances, a pictogram could be used to draw consumers' attention to a specific web based data bank disclosing the full list of skin sensitizers contained in the product. ""This website will enable downstream consumer product companies to add any relevant information, notably the one relative to the presence of allergens and guidance on applications and warnings,"" add IFRA, Cosmebio and UEAPME. According to the three trade organisations, this hybrid approach could also offer additional advantages. For instance, the voluntary recommendations provided by the brands through their websites could generate a substantial benefit for allergic consumers. For the medical community, on-line consultation of information would even offer the option to analyse the patient's extensive products usage without the burden of referring to the physical products."
Cosmed calls for a simplification of the Cosmetics Regulation,"Responsible for making concrete proposals to strengthen the competitiveness of European SMEs, Commissioner Timmermans met six organizations representing the interests of small and medium French companies through a dinner organized by the General Confederation of Small and Medium sized Enterprises (CGPME [1]), an interprofessional organisation for employers. On this occasion, the President of Cosmed called for a simplification of regulations that, according to him, could have a direct positive impact on the margins of SMEs, without compromising consumer safety. Six proposals were put under the spotlights by Cosmed: – Extended deadlines for the compliance of products after regulatory changes. Current deadlines for the compliance of new products and the removal of old products from the market are limited to 6 and 12 months respectively. Cosmed proposes to double this period (1 year and 2 years). – Suppression of Certificates of Free Sale (CFS). Cosmed said the Commission could pressure non-EU countries requesting this document to obtain a simplification of import procedures. – International recognition of self-certification of compliance with European GMP, which is not easily accepted by some national authorities. – Consistence and coordination in the treatment of sanitary risks by avoiding pointing out the cosmetics industry alone when complex health issues also involve other sectors. – Simplification of product labelling, by focusing on essential information only and allowing using digital information to inform a specific population, for instance on the presence of allergens. – Vigilance in the TTIP negotiations (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership). Eventually, the CGPME Directorate highlighted more general issues, in particular the lack of harmonization in several areas, such as social and fiscal regulations, thus leaving national discrepancies unsuited to the economic context. ""Franz Timmermans has asked the members of its cabinet to investigate these issues and to maintain contact and regular dialogue with Cosmed for the cosmetics industry, and the CGPME for general topics,"" said Cosmed."
Brazilian health agency simplifies registration of cosmetic products,"According to the resolution DRC 07/2015 of the 10th of February 2015, a large part of products that are classified as risk grade 2 [1] will now be exempt from registration. These products will only have to be notified to health authorities before being placed on the market, with the exception of product categories that are submitted to specific regulations (sunscreens, insect repellents, products for children, as well as alcohol gel products and hair straighteners). Products classified as risk grade 1 were already exempt from registration. Advance notification is a simplified administrative procedure to inform ANVISA about the intention of placing a product on the market. As a consequence, products of Grade 1 and Grade 2 submitted to the procedure can be placed on the market as soon as the notification is confirmed on the ANVISA's web portal. Products of Grade 2 that remain subject to registration can only be placed on the market when the official registration is granted and published in the Official Gazette. Registration generally requires about 60 days, while the notification is usually completed within 48 hours. The control of products exempt from registration will be carried out through procedures including periodic and random controls, as well as market monitoring including the control and analysis of products available on retail shelves. Products that still need to be registered are listed in Annex VIII of Resolution RDC 07/2015. The list includes tanning products, hair straightening products, sunscreens, insect repellents, antiseptic hand gels and children's products. ""Considering their higher level of risk, these products remain submitted to analyses performed by the Agency,"" said the AVINSA. The new rule aims at providing more flexibility to the sector and enabling the Agency to focus its analyses of products with the higher level of risk. ""This is a historic change for the personal care, perfumery and cosmetic industry,"" said the Brazilian Association of the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Industry (ABIHPEC). ""We have debated this issue since 2008 and we celebrate now another step forward for the Brazilian industry, which comes closer from global practices. This achievement will provide greater predictability to the industry to launch products, resulting in a more competitive and innovative market. It will also speed up consumer access to the industry's products and help improve health, well being and quality of life,"" said João Carlos Basilio, President of the ABIHPEC. Technical and safety requirements applicable to cosmetic products remain unchanged. The person responsible for marketing cosmetics must ""ensure that the product does present any risk to health when used in accordance with the instructions,"" says the article 10 of the new resolution."
Ban on cosmetics animal testing makes progress around the world,"The South Korean Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs has announced that finished cosmetics product testing on animals will be banned, followed by consideration of a further ban on the testing of ingredients. This move is part of the Ministry's 5 Year Plan for Animal Welfare. ""We very much welcome this important breakthrough and we are grateful to the members of the National Assembly who helped us press the case. We will now be urging implementation as soon as possible so that the full ban can be achieved at the earliest possible date, bringing Korea into line with Europe and India"", commented Michelle Thew, Chief Executive of Cruelty Free International. ""We hope to see this echoed in 2015 by other Asian countries where we are active. This is a great start to the New Year,"" she added. As far as cosmetics animal testing is concerned, 2014 can be viewed as a milestone year with awesome breakthroughs worldwide. After having prohibited the tests in its territory, India has announced a ban on imports of animal tested cosmetics, China has made important progress towards ending mandatory animal testing, and several countries, including Brazil and Australia, are discussing bills to ban tests on animals for cosmetics. Ban on cosmetics animal testing: 2014 Highlights – India bans cosmetics animal testing and the sale of animal tested cosmetics – China removes mandatory animal testing for most domestically-produced cosmetics – Brazil's state of Sao Paulo bans cosmetics animal testing – Brazil bill launched for national test ban – New Zealand MP launches bid for cosmetics animal test ban in Animal Welfare Act – New Zealand's Labour Party pledges support for a ban on cosmetics animal testing – Australia's Green Party launches End Cruel Cosmetics Bill – Australian Senate Motion launched with unprecedented cross-party support – United States' Humane Cosmetics Act backed by more than 140 companies and the bill is introduced by Representative Jim Moran ""We've ended cosmetics animal testing in India, started the ball rolling in China, seen bills introduced in Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, Taiwan and the United States. There are still thousands of animals suffering for our lip sticks and shampoo, so we have a long way to go but I'm excited to see the progress we'll make for animals in 2015,"" said Claire Mansfield, #BeCrueltyFree Campaigns Director at the Humane Society International (HIS)."
Australia bans commercial sunbeds over cancer fears,"The ban - which came into force in the states of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, Queensland and in the Australian Capital Territory on January 1 - made Australia the second nation after Brazil to impose such a restriction, public health campaigners said. Western Australia has said it would also implement a ban, though it has yet to announce a start date. There are no commercial solariums in the only other part of Australia - the hot and humid Northern Territory. Cancer Council Australia welcomed the ban, which it has long pushed for, adding that it would help to reduce rates of skin cancer, which affects two out of three Australians by age 70. ""Australia has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world,"" advocacy director Paul Grogan said in a statement to AFP. ""Solariums expose users to extremely highly levels of UV (ultraviolet) radiation, greatly increasing their risk of melanoma and other skin cancers."" Australia is sometimes referred to as the sunburnt country, where beaches are thronged with bathers basking under blue skies and the rates of melanoma, a potentially fatal form of skin cancer, are the highest in the world. Australia's proximity to Antarctica, where there is a hole in the ozone layer which normally filters out UV rays, also increases the risk. Public health campaigners and authorities have long pushed to promote awareness of the dangers of exposure to the sun, urging people to wear sunscreen, hats and sunglasses. They have also warned that tanning on a sunbed is not safe. ""Queensland already has the highest rate of skin cancer in the world and there is no question there's a direct link between regular sunbed use and the incidence of malignant melanoma,"" the state's interim Health Minister Mark McArdle told Australian Associated Press. The incidence of skin cancers in Australia is two to three times the rates in Canada, the United States and Great Britain, the Cancer Council said. More than 2000 Australians died from skin cancer in 2011, the majority from melanoma, which is caused by harmful ultraviolet light from the sun, the council added. Previous research suggested that the use of sunbeds by people aged 18 to 39 increases their risk of developing melanoma, the most common form of cancer among young Australians, by an average of 41 per cent. The ban was supported by a majority of Australians, the council said, in a recent survey of 6,300 people, while fewer adults and youths said they had used a solarium in the past year. About one per cent of adults and 0.3 per cent of youths used a sunbed, the data showed, down from 2.2 per cent and 1.2 per cent a decade ago. Several European countries and American states have also banned the use of sunbeds by minors, according to research published in the journal Nature."
High Court refers questions about the scope of the ban on animal testing of cosmetics to the ECJ,"Brought before the High Court by the European Federation for Cosmetic Ingredients (EFfCI), the action concerned the interpretation of the EU ban on animal testing of cosmetic products and their ingredients. The Court concluded the claim involved a real issue and referred questions to the European Court of Justice (ECJ). [1] Contained in Article 18 of Regulation (EC) 1223/2009 on cosmetics products, the ban prohibits the marketing in the European Economic Area (EEA) of cosmetics products tested on animals or containing ingredients tested on animals. The questions referred concern the extent to which the ban applies to cosmetic ingredients tested on animals for the purposes of regulatory requirements imposed by non-EEA countries. Actually, countries outside the European Union, such as China and Japan, may require some cosmetic ingredients to undergo certain tests, including tests on animals, to demonstrate the safety of those ingredients. According to EFfCI, there is uncertainty about whether placing cosmetic products incorporating these ingredients upon the market in the United Kingdom, or the rest of the European Union, would involve a breach of the prohibition imposed by Article 18(1)(b) of the Cosmetics Regulation. The Humane Society International (HSI), animal rights group, said this action could to undermine the EU's historic cosmetics animal testing ban. ""The industry's legal action could be a potential disaster for animal welfare and is a betrayal of the clearly expressed desire by EU consumers to end cruel and needless animal testing for cosmetics no matter where in the world that animal testing is taking place. EFfCI's case would undermine both the spirit and the letter of the EU ban, effectively allowing companies to continue testing cosmetics on animals abroad, and importing them back into the EU. We hope the ECJ will see fit to reject this case and find in favour of a strong and comprehensive ban,"" explained Susie Wilks, HSI's #BeCrueltyFree Policy Advisor.

The Sunscreen Innovation Act: What is changing?,"In the US, products that protect the skin against sunburns are classified as OTC drugs (standing for ""over-the-counter drugs""). One of the consequences of this classification is that the approval of new active ingredients (in this case new UV filters) for these products is subject to a process initially designed for the approval of new drugs. Over the years, the acceptance of new sunscreens has proved much more complex and long in the United States than in Europe or Asia, where sunscreens are generally considered as cosmetic products. ""The last over-the-counter (OTC) sunscreen ingredient to be approved by FDA was in the 1990s. Since 2002, eight new sunscreen applications have been filed and are still awaiting review 12 years later,"" said the Public Access to SunScreens (PASS) Coalition, which members include the Skin Cancer Foundation, Prevent Cancer Foundation, Melanoma Research Foundation, Dr. Fallick, Dr. Henry Lim, Dr. Nadim Shaath, Dr. Steven Wang, Dr. Warwick Morison, Beiersdorf, L'Oréal USA Products, Ashland Inc., BASF Corporation, DeWolf Chemical, Fitz Chem Corporation, and McCullough & Associates. The new law: – Requires the FDA to reduce the existing regulatory backlog of sunscreen applications and ensure an improved, reliable approval pathway for future sunscreen applications while maintaining the existing safety and effectiveness requirements for sunscreens; – Requires the FDA to provide expedited approval pathways for pending sunscreen ingredients; – Requires the FDA to regularly report to Congress on its efforts to reduce the backlog of existing applications and review of new ingredients; – Requires independent reporting by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) on the regulatory pathway for sunscreen products and other OTC products; – Requires the FDA to finalize its regulations related to all OTC sunscreens. ""We are confident that the new law will enable Americans to have greater choice when it comes to protecting their skin from the sun's harmful UVA and UVB rays,"" said Michael Werner, PASS Coalition Policy Advisor.

Plastic microbeads: Australia to stop; ban is on governor's office in New Jersey,"The latest news regarding the withdrawal of polyethylene beads from cosmetic and personal care products came from Australia. In a statement dated November 21, Accord, Australia's industry association for the hygiene, cosmetic and specialty products industry, announced that the local operators are committed to working towards a phase-out of polyethylene microbeads by the end of 2017. Accord says its decision reflects both the importance of environmental protection for the Australian industry and the need to adapt to a change in market conditions as several U.S. states are considering a ban on these substances. This summer, Illinois was the first state to adopt a binding legislation on this subject. In August, the Council of State Governments (CSG), a U.S. body that monitors and highlights innovative legislation from one state that may be beneficial to other states, has added the new Illinois' law into its annual Suggested State Legislation (SSL) volume. This decision was applauded by the Personal Care Products Council, the leading trade association representing the cosmetic and personal care products industry in the U.S. ""The nation's personal care products companies are pleased to support efforts that demonstrate their longstanding commitment to the global stewardship of their products. We urge policy makers to work with all sectors of the business community as they seek to eliminate plastic waste in our waterways and to identify effective and realistic solutions that consider the existing and emerging science as it becomes available,"" the Personal Care Products Council stated. Actually, a ban on the manufacture and sale of plastic microbeads used in personal care products by December 2017, as specified in the Illinois' legislation, seem to be acceptable for the US association. Most recently, the New Jersey Senate voted the final text of the A3083 Diegnan, Moriarty bill, which aims to ban the production of cosmetics containing plastic beads from 1 January 2018 and to prohibit the presence of such products on the market after 1 January 2019. The text is now awaiting New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's approval."
Preservatives: The EU Commission further restricts the scope of possibilities,"These new decisions follow a risk assessment by the independent Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS). The first measure adopted by the Commission [1] limits the maximum concentration of Propylparaben and Butylparaben, from currently allowed limit of 0.4% when used individually and 0.8% when mixed with other esters, to 0.14%, when used individually or together. Furthermore, the two preservatives are being banned from leave-on products designed for the nappy area of young children below the age of three. Indeed, the Commission explains, ""existing skin irritation and occlusion may allow increased penetration than intact skin."" The new rules will apply for products put on shelves after April 16, 2015. Non-complying products must be withdrawn from the market by October 16, 2015. You can download Commission regulation (EU) No 1004/2014 here below: Earlier this year, the Commission banned the use of five other parabens in cosmetic products - Isopropylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Phenylparaben, Benzylparaben and Pentylparaben [2] due to the lack of data necessary for reassessment. Products placed on the market after 30 October 2014 will have to be free from these substances. However, this decision was a mere reflect of the industry's practice as most manufacturers had already banned these substances from their formulations. Secondly, the Commission bans the mixture of Methylchloroisothiazolinone and Methylisothiazolinone (MCI/MI) from leave-on products such as body creams [3]. The measure is aimed at reducing the risk from and the incidence of skin allergies. You can download Commission regulation (EU) No 1003/2014 here below: However, the mixture can still be used in rinse-off products, such as shampoos and shower gels at a maximum concentration of 0.0015 % of a mixture in the ratio 3:1 of MCI/MI. The measure will apply for products placed on the market after July 16, 2015. Non-complying products must be withdrawn from the market by April 16, 2015. Last December, Cosmetics Europe, the association representing the personal care industry in Europe, recommended to discontinue the use of methylisothiazolinone (MIT) in leave-on skin products, including cosmetic wet wipes. However, the Commission also reiterated the important role of preservatives for the safety of consumers. ""Preservatives in cosmetics serve a valuable function ensuring that the products we use on a daily basis are free from pathogens. We need however to ensure that the preservatives guarantee the maximum degree of protection,"" said the European Commissioner for Consumer Policy, Neven Mimica. The status of other parabens, like Methylparaben and Ethylparaben, remains unchanged. The EU Commission reminded that the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) has repeatedly confirmed them as safe. ""They are also some of the most efficient preservatives,"" the Commission added."
"French justice imposes a fine on perfumery ""pirates""","As intellectual property rights are being challenged all over the Internet, Pin thought of the 12/10/2013 French Court of Cassation's decision to refuse the protection of perfume copyrights [1] as a ""perfume liberation"". The company then presented its activity as operated by a ""handful of mavericks"" describing themselves as ""adventurers armed simply with an idea, a vision: essences have never had owners"". The www.pirate-parfum.fr website thus provided Internet users with a search engine so that they could find the references of an alternative fragrance (Pirate) by typing the name of a well-known perfume. In short, it was like a modern version of the ""concordance tables"" that French lawyers in industrial and commercial property used to hunt down on small town markets. Twenty companies owning the brands used issued a writ against Pin. The company defended itself mainly by maintaining it used these brands for purely descriptive and comparative purposes. The Court rejected this argument, considering in its judgment that ""word marks in the comparative lists published are not used for purely descriptive purposes, but for advertising purposes"", thus enabling Pin to ""unduly take advantage of the (…) brands, the said brands being known for identifying fragrances associated with a world of prestige, and which were subject to massive marketing investments Pin could spare itself, while benefitting from them through the system of access to products it set up"", and ""damaging the communication, investment or advertising function attached to the brands concerned"". All in all, Pin does not refer to the brands it mentions in order to compare its own products, but to profit from their fame by sparing itself the marketing design and development costs their owners did meet to become as famous as they are now. The judges considered the brand infringement was blatant, and therefore imposed on the defendant a fine of €564,000 for damages on account of ""the damage to their brands as a result of the infringement acts"", and of €640,000 on account of ""the loss of earnings as a result of the infringement acts"". They also obliged Pin to cease any use of the litigant brands on its website. However, judges rejected the ""misleading advertising"" grievance, as they considered nothing established the falsity of the information published on the www.pirate-parfum.fr website, in particular regarding the mention stating the geographical origin (Italian and/or French) of the alternative fragrances available. More surprisingly, the judges also refused to consider the mentions ""three times cheaper"" and ""the only label which is able to guarantee 95 % product costs for 5 % marketing costs, whereas this trend is completely the opposite for all others"" disparaging, on the ground that ""consumers reasonably well-informed of commercial practices (…), particularly when it comes to luxury products, know that a significant part of the price results from the investments made for their design, advertising and place of distribution, so they are not surprised to see a product imitating a premium brand perfume (…), which did not get the same publicity, is cheaper"". This decision contributes to reinforcing brands' rights when dealing with the – often aggressive – practices of some website operators, and that is rare enough a ruling to be welcomed."
Ukraine: A new regulation for cosmetic products?,"Of course, Ukrainian authorities surely have other priorities and emergencies to deal with! Nevertheless, the implementation of the new Technical Regulation on the safety of cosmetic products has not been postponed. The new Technical Regulation provides a definition of cosmetic products and several lists of regulated ingredients that are almost identical to those in force in the European Union. The text also includes a definition of nanomaterials that is similar to the definition provided in the European cosmetics regulation, and it refers to GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices). Furthermore, the definition of ""manufacturer"" is complemented by the notion of ""person responsible for placing the product on the market"". If its entry into force is confirmed, the new regulation should facilitate the access to the Ukrainian market. However, in the meantime, the current procedure remains applicable. The foreign manufacturer or its authorized representative must: – Meet the requirements of the Ukrainian Ministry of Health's Sanitary and Epidemiological Service, – Meet the requirements of the UkrSepro standards (for some hair products), – Provide access to the technical file, – Provide the instructions of use, – To comply with UkrSepro health inspection and certification procedures, – Get a positive sanitary and epidemiological assment and provide it together with the products, – Obtain the UkrSepro Certificate of Conformity (for some hair products). In practice, the original conclusions of the sanitary and epidemiological assessment and the UkrSepro Certificate of Conformity, or certified copies, are required upon the entry of products on the Ukrainian market - namely from the clearance - and thereafter to the point of sale. The conclusions of the sanitary and epidemiological assessment is issued by accredited bodies with the Sanitary and Epidemiological Service of the Ministry of Health, based on a documentary analysis and laboratory product testing. Most of the cosmetic products are subject to this requirement. The procedure for obtaining lasts about 3 weeks and the document is valid for a period of 3 to 5 years. Several hair product categories (such as shampoos, soaps, sprays, etc.) are subject to mandatory certification on the basis of documentary expertise and laboratory testing products. The procedure for obtaining the UkrSepro Certificate of Conformity lasts about 3 weeks and the validity of the document is of 3 years. Given the current political situation in Ukraine, forecasts regarding the market trends are largely pessimistic. The eventual enforcement the new Technical Regulation should obviously be considered in relation to this broader context."
The perfumery industry faces a harsh regulatory environment,"Invited to open the discussion, Patricia de Nicolaï, an independent perfumer and the current president of the Osmothèque, the International Conservatory of Perfumes, reminded how perfumery is an important patrimonial heritage in France. While we can trace its origins to the Renaissance, the perfumes and cosmetics sector is also a strong reality in today's France where it is the third largest net exporter of the French industry. Furthermore, it is composed of 81% of SMEs. Having invested heavily to adapt their processes to the new requirements of the European Cosmetic Regulations [1], the perfume industry is now worrying about the possible consequences of a regulatory environment that has considerably tightened. Michèle Elbaz, Delegate Director Regulation and Safety at Chanel, has reviewed the perfume substances whose legal status is under review whether in application of the Cosmetics Regulation or in application of REACH. Some of these substances correspond to series for which the European Commission questioned the Scientific Committee [2] some years ago and which are still under discussion, waiting for regulatory measures (Tagetes minuta, patula; Methyl -N -methyl anthranilate; Vetiveryl acetate; Acetaldehyde). Some substances also fall under the scope of Article 15 of the Regulation on cosmetic products, which prohibits the use of CMR substances classified in category 1A (known CMR effect on humans), 1B (Suspected CMR effect on humans) or 2 (suspected CMR effect, but the available information is insufficient). Furthermore, some substances are also impacted by some additional REACH procedures besides registration, namely Substance Evaluation and Harmonized Classification and Labelling. This is the case, for example, of BMHCA, Furfuryl alcohol, Citral and Citronellal. ""However, this does not necessarily mean that these substances are about to be prohibited or restricted,"" said Michèle Elbaz. Indeed, the deadline of their assessment may be delayed, depending on priorities, or they may be removed from the list if their REACH dossier has been fulfilled. However, the situation for the fragrance industry could become even more complex. Indeed, REACH procedures are currently very focused on CMR but should be massively expanded to include sensitizing and endocrine disruptors. ""The challenge will be to demonstrate that the risk posed by skin sensitizers is sufficiently managed by the Cosmetics Regulation and the Regulations for the protection of workers, and that skin sensitizers cannot be treated a as CMRs,"" said Michèle Ebaz. Florian Schellauf, Issue Manager at Cosmetics Europe, exposed the situation regarding the other big concern: perfumery allergens. The measures proposed by the European Commission in response to the recommendations of the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) are currently subject to public consultation. The Commission is pursuing two main goals: to prevent induction (the onset of allergies), and to prevent elicitation (the trigger of allergic reactions among sensitized individuals). The Commission therefore proposed to prohibit certain substances, to restrict the concentration of a series of others, and to add many substances to the list of allergens that must be labelled. ""In this context, Cosmetics Europe is proposing a series of solutions which, while being very pragmatic, will ensure that consumers be properly informed,"" says Florian Schellauf. In particular, Cosmetics Europe suggests that companies may chose to label the list of allergens on the package or to provide this information electronically. A logo (left) could inform concerned consumers that the information they need is available online. ""The general revolution of providing information in electronic format has progressed in such a manner that a majority of consumers today prefer this way of receiving information. Accessing information electronically has become a fact of life and an integral part of society"", said Florian Schellauf. Cosmetics Europe also supports a change in the INCI nomenclature, in order to allow abbreviations. The European Association also requested a transition period of at least 6 years for products already placed on the market. The public consultation period on this issue will end mid-May 2014. The Commission will then submit its final proposals to the Parliament and the Council for final adoption in late 2014 or early 2015. Then perfumers will know their fate."
Access to genetic resources: the European Parliament votes new rules,"The European Union and all of its 27 Member States are Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), which entered into force on 29 December 1993. The CBD recognizes that states have sovereign rights over genetic resources found within their jurisdiction and the authority to determine access to such resources. The Convention obliges all Parties to facilitate access to genetic resources over which they hold sovereign rights. It also obliges all Parties to share in a fair and equitable way the results of research and development and the benefits arising from the commercial and other utilization of genetic resources with the Party providing these resources. However, the CBD provides little detail on how access and benefit-sharing (ABS) for the use of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge should be done in practice. This is precisely the aim of ""Nagoya Protocol"" adopted on 29 October 2010. The aim of the new Regulation is to implement a European set of rules on access to genetic resources and fair and equitable sharing of benefits resulting from their utilization, thus preparing the ratification of the Nagoya Protocol. ""This regulation eventually sets up a tool to fight biopiracy as it prohibits the use in the European Union of any genetic resources that would not have been legally acquired. It is the first European instrument in favour of biodiversity since the habitats directive of 1992,"" highlights Sandrine Bélier, the Parliament's rapporteur on the convention on biological diversity. The new EU rules also aim to monitor and support compliance with ABS requirements already implemented around the world. Laws and regulations in biodiversity rich countries such as Brazil, South Africa, and India already include requirements on how to access biological material for research and development and how to share the monetary and non-monetary benefits resulting from innovations or new products. ""The Parliament vote is a landmark vote that will significantly impact the way biodiversity based R&D is conducted"", says María Julia Oliva, Senior Coordinator for Policy and Technical Support at the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT). This mainly concerns the food, pharmaceutical, biotechnology and cosmetic sectors. Companies involved in biodiversity-based research and development will have to seek, keep and transfer information such as on the date and place of access; their source and any subsequent users, and the relevance and compliance with any ABS requirements. When there are uncertainties around ABS compliance, they must obtain relevant permits or discontinue utilization. In turn, EU Member States will establish different checkpoints, including during final stages of product development, for companies to declare compliance with due diligence requirements. The new regulation still has to be adopted by the Council, but that should be a mere formality as EU Member States have already agreed on the current version of the text during a meeting of the Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER) in December 2013. Also note that latest developments on ABS, including the practical implications of the new EU rules for companies working with natural ingredients, will be analyzed at the upcoming conference on the ""Beauty of Sourcing with Respect,"" organized by the UEBT on 8 April 2014 in Paris (www.ethicalbiotrade.org/bsr_2014)."
Australian senator introduces legislation to end animal tests on cosmetics,"The bill introduced by Australian Senator Lee Rhiannon, who is also Greens animal welfare spokesperson, aims to modify existing legislation, in particular the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989 to ban cosmetics animal testing within Australia as well as the import and sale of cosmetics newly animal-tested abroad. ""We are encouraged that MPs from both Labor and the Liberals have pledged their support to the Be Cruelty-Free Australia campaign. This takes us one step closer to ending cosmetics animal cruelty in Australia,"" Senator Rhiannon said. Indeed, this landmark legislation follows more than a year of campaigning by Be Cruelty-Free Australia - a coalition of Humane Society International and Humane Research Australia. Thus, several federal politicians have already pledged their support for Be Cruelty-Free Australia, including the legislation's sponsor Senator Lee Rhiannon, Deputy Opposition Leader Tanya Plibersek, Leader of the Greens Christine Milne, Greens MP Adam Bandt, Labor MP Anna Burke, Liberal MP Jason Wood, Senator Scott Ludlam, Senator Richard Di Natale, Senator Penny Wright, and Senator Peter Whish-Wilson. ""There is overwhelming public support for a national cosmetics animal testing and sales ban in Australia, so we are delighted that politicians are joining with our Be Cruelty-Free Australia campaign to achieve this shared goal,""commented Hannah Stuart, Be Cruelty-Free Australia The proposed new Australian legislation would mirror the test and sales ban introduced in the European Union in 2009 and 2013 respectively. ""The European Union, one of the world's biggest markets, is already cruelty-free and it's great that Australia will be joining the list of cruelty-free countries,"" said Greens deputy leader Adam Bandt. A similar bill was introduced last week in the USA, in context where there is a global pressure to end animal testing."
USA: A step forward towards the end of cosmetic testing on animals?,"Introduced by Congressman Jim Moran, The Humane Cosmetics Act (H.R. 4148), aims at ensuring animals are not harmed in the process of creating or manufacturing cosmetics. ""The U.S. can and should phase out the use of animals in cosmetic safety testing. Not only are animal-based tests fundamentally inhumane, they also rely on outmoded science that can fail to accurately predict safety for humans,"" said Representative Moran. ""This legislation would encourage the use of testing alternatives that are more effective and cheaper to conduct, helping the American cosmetic industry remain the dominant, and humane, leader in the global cosmetics market."" If it would be enacted, The Humane Cosmetics Act, H.R. 4148, would make it unlawful for anyone to conduct or commission cosmetic animal testing in the U.S., and would prohibit selling, offering for sale or transporting any cosmetics in interstate commerce if the final product or any component was developed or manufactured using animal testing. See text here below: This Federal bill is endorsed by animal rights organisations, such as The Humane Society of the United States, the Humane Society Legislative Fund and Humane Society International, along with members and stakeholders of the personal care products industry, including Lush, Jack Black, Biao skincare and Aubrey Organics. ""Our customers and ingredient suppliers support the Humane Cosmetics Act, and we urge members of the House of Representatives to co-sponsor this important bill. We believe all cosmetics should be cruelty-free,"" said Lush North America CEO & President Mark Wolverton. Bans on animal-tested cosmetics have been implemented in the 28 states of the European Union, and in Israel. India has prohibited domestic animal testing for cosmetic products and ingredients, and is working on a follow-up import and sales ban. The State of São Paulo, Brazil, recently signed a bill prohibiting cosmetics testing on animals, and the Brazilian federal regulatory body for animal experiments will be voting on this issue later this month. In China, where animal testing has historically been required, the Chinese Food and Drug Administration announced it will remove the mandatory animal testing for non-essential domestically produced cosmetics in June 2014. The international trend is clearly toward the ban of animal tests for cosmetics. The bill was assigned to a congressional committee, which will consider it before possibly sending it on to the House or Senate as a whole. Statistics show that this bill has a 4% chance of getting past committee first. Furthermore, only 11% of bills made it past committee and only about 3% were enacted in 2011–2013."
Fragrance allergens: the measures proposed by the EU Commission,"After more than a year and a half of concerns, the fragrance industry eventually knows what are the new European Commission's proposals regarding the protection of consumers from potential fragrance allergens: some substances will be prohibited and others will have to labelled. At the origin of the strong worries within the perfumery community was the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) dated 26-27 June 2012. The SCCS then recommended – To add more than 50 fragrance components to the current list of 26 allergens that must be labelled on cosmetic products – To limit the concentration of substances of special concern (twelve single chemicals and eight natural extracts) at 0.01% or 100 ppm in cosmetic products in order to prevent elicitation for the majority of individuals. Another cause for concern for perfumers: the SCCS recommendation to ban certain substances, some of them being used for years and in a huge number of perfumes. Eventually, the Commission proposals fall short of the SCCS recommendations, while being in line with its main axes: – The three substances which were found to be unsafe (HICC, atranol and chloroatranol) should be banned from cosmetic products, through the revision of Annex II of the European Cosmetics Regulation (EC No. 1223/2009). – Additional allergens should be mentioned in the list of ingredients, in addition to the words 'parfum' or 'aroma', when their concentration exceeds 0.001% in leave-on products and 0.01% in rinse-off products. Thus, tree mosses should not be prohibited, but will have to be purified so as not to contain prohibited molecules. Regarding the twenty substances of ""special concern"", the Commission does not provide direct answer but opens the door to the adoption of thresholds, using the QRA approach. [1] ""We broadly welcome the proposed measures,"" said Pierre Sivac, President of the International Fragrance Association (IFRA). ""The Commission has devoted a great deal of effort to assess all the aspects of this issue and we think that the measures are relevant and will be effective."" However, IFRA says to be concerned that the extension of the current labelling of allergens ""may not improve the level of information for consumers already sensitized."" The organisation, which represents the fragrance industry, considers that combining meaningful labelling and additional information through a website could have been more effective. The Commission's proposals are now open for public comments. Interested parties, including EU Member States, manufacturers of cosmetic products, producers of fragrances and consumers associations, may send their comments by 14th May at the latest. Taking the consultations into account, the proposed changes to the Cosmetics Regulation in the form of an implementing act will be subject to a vote by the Member States in the standing Committee on Cosmetics. Once the measures are approved by the Member States, the European Parliament and the Council will have three months to exercise their right of scrutiny. If the proposal is not opposed the formal adoption of those changes is expected at the end of 2014/beginning 2015."
Japan and the USA under pressure to end animal testing for cosmetics,"While testing cosmetics and their ingredients on animals is now prohibited in the European Union, India, Israel and in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, over 80% of the world - including the United States - still allows animals to be used in experiments for cosmetic products. To change the situation, Cruelty Free International, the leading animal rights association fighting against vivisection, has partnered with The Body Shop to collect the signatures of consumers and supporters in more than 65 countries including Japan, the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Russia. Customers of The Body Shop stores were asked to sign a pledge calling for an end to tests on animals for cosmetic purposes, and about one million signatures were collected. Last week, Cruelty Free International, Japan Anti-Vivisection Association (JAVA) and The Body Shop called on Japan to end the use of animals to test cosmetics. Dr Nick Palmer, Director of Policy with Cruelty Free International, was in Japan to help present a petition to the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare, Norihisa Tamura. ""In today's Japan, some cosmetic companies have given up animal experiments in response to consumers' appeals whilst others are still testing on animals. In order to improve such a confused situation without a level playing field for all companies, the Japanese government should proactively introduce into its policies the new ethical value to promote the abolition of animal testing,"" explained JAVA Executive Director, Yuichi Hasegawa. According to Dr Nick Palmer, Mr Norihisa Tamura, said that it was now clear that the global trend was away from animal testing for cosmetics. The Minister of Health still saw difficulties in an early Government initiative but encouraged members of the Diet [Japanese Parliament] to bring forward suggestions. ""The meeting was an important step. Up to now, Japan has not engaged with us on the issue so we very much welcome Mr Tamura acceptance that the problem needs to be tackled. We look forward to a constructive dialogue on the way forward,"" Dr Palmer commented. As far as the U.S.A. is concerned, representatives from Cruelty Free International and The Body Shop met with Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) to discuss the petition. Mrs Schakowsky is the leading legislator working on cosmetics regulation reform in the United States. ""We appeal the to the United States Government to listen to the collective voice of one million people and start putting plans in place to end these experiments and prevent further unnecessary suffering for thousands of animals,"" said Cruelty Free International Chief Executive, Michelle Thew."
Sao Paulo to ban animal testing for cosmetics,"Bill 777/2013 prohibiting the use of animals in testing and experiments performed for the development of cosmetics, toiletries, fragrances and their components, was signed on Thursday the 23rd of January by, Geraldo Alckmin, governor of the State of Sao Paulo. This project had already been approved by the Sao Paulo Parliament, at a special session on 11 December. Before signing the law, Governor Alckmin met all stakeholders, including animal rights advocates, representatives of the cosmetics industry, and scientists etc. ""We have screened all aspects related to this issue, including international law, and heard all sectors,"" explained Geraldo Alckmin. For their part, animal advocates warmly welcomed this decision, the first of its kind in Latin America, which will be enforced in the most populous and mst industrialized Brazilian state, where most of the country's cosmetics production is located. ""We congratulate the Parliament and Governor Alckmin on their progressive decision and call on other state governments and the national government to follow their example,"" stated Cruelty Free International's representative in Brazil, Frank Alarcón. According to the new law, any violation by an institution or research centre could be fine one million reais (about 305,000 euros or 415,000 US dollars) per animal. The amount of the fine will be doubled in case of new offense and the establishment may be closed. Fines may also be imposed on concerned physical persons. The new law (No. 15316 of 23 January 2014) came into force on the 24th of January 2014, the day of its publication in the official journal of the state of Sao Paulo."
No more methylisothiazolinone in leave-on cosmetics,"Following a surge of dermatological consultations resulting from allergic reactions to methylisothiazolinone (MIT), the dermatology community recently alerted public authorities and the industry about the risks linked to the presence of this substance in cosmetics. For instance, a study released at the British Association of Dermatologists' Annual Conference, which was held in Liverpool in July 2013, showed a sharp rise in contact allergy to the MCI/MI [1] mixture and to MI alone over the past three years. In the wake of these reports, the European Commission proposed to amend Annex V of Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 on cosmetic products in order to limit the use of the MCI/MI mixture and MI alone. However, Cosmetics Europe recommends companies do not wait for regulatory intervention under the Cosmetics Regulation but stop using MIT in leave-on skin products as soon as feasible. The European trade association says that industry experts have concluded there was evidence to suggest a relationship between the use of leave-on skin products, including cosmetic wet wipes containing MIT, and the induction of contact allergy and allergic contact dermatitis. ""Following close analysis of clinical data, market feedback and Quantitative Risk Assessment analysis, Cosmetics Europe has concluded that the discontinuation of MIT use in leave-on skin products would result in a significant decrease in the incidence of sensitisation to this ingredient,"" explains Cosmetics Europe. MIT was introduced to the market as a cosmetic preservative in 2006, and since then has been widely used due to its broad spectrum preservation properties. However, this substance was previously used in combination with chloromethylisothiazolinone under the trade name Kathon-CG. Once widely and commonly used, Kathon-CG was gradually abandoned and its use restricted to certain rinsed off products such as shampoos. Kathon-CG has been gradually replaced by parabens, which had the advantage of being much more tolerated. As a consequence, parabens were present in nearly 70% of cosmetic products, until their safety was questioned. Allergenic problems linked to preservatives have led some cosmetic manufacturers to look for non-chemical alternatives to protect their formulations, including new formulation concepts, sterilisation processes or protective packaging. Experts will take stock of the latest innovations in this field at a conference organised by Premium Beauty News in Paris on January 23, 2014."
"France: about 500,000 tons of nanomaterials placed on the market","Approximately 500,000 tons of nanomaterials have been placed on the French market in 2012. This figure is the result of the mandatory ""census"" required by the law. A first report, based on the data collected during the census was released by the French Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy. ""This is the first time that all manufacturers, distributors or importers of substances in a nanoparticle size - a billionth of a meter length scale - must declare the uses and the annual quantities produced, imported and distributed on French territory,"" says the Ministry. The first series of declarations, covering the year 2012, was collected via a dedicated web site [1]. In total, more than 930 registrants have made more than 3400 declarations. Of these 500,000 tons, 280,000 tons were produced in France and 220,000 tonnes were imported. Cosmetics and personal care products represent 6.1 % of reported uses, ranking in the third position of identified uses, behind the formulations (mixtures) of preparations and / or re-packaging (19.6% of all declarations), coats and paints, solvents, thinners (8.1%). Despite difficulties in accurately identifying reported substances, the report includes a list of the substances for which the largest quantities (over 100 tonnes) were declared. The list is topped by: carbon black, silicon dioxide, calcium carbonate, titanium dioxide and aluminum oxide. As far as the industry is concerned, the Union of Chemical Industries (UIC) emphasized the strong mobilization of chemical manufacturers, despite practical difficulties with the collection system, but expressed its concerns regarding ""the impact of this initiative on the chemical industry in France."" ""So far, France is the only country in the world that has implemented a mandatory declaration, while regulations concerning chemicals are almost exclusively developed at the European level, at least,"" said Jean Pelin, Director General of the UIC. A second report will be published in January 2014."
Animal testing: Asia shows growing interest for alternatives,"Last February, Shiseido was the first among the leading Asian cosmetic companies to announced its will to eliminate on animal tests in line with the European ban. ""Shiseido does not test its cosmetic products on animals, under any circumstances. As for cosmetic ingredients, we do not conduct animal testing save for exceptional cases where it is required by law, or where there are absolutely no other alternative methods (…). Shiseido's goal is to eliminate 'animal testing' for cosmetics, rigorously working to ensure the safety of cosmetics, in order that our customers can feel safe to use them, while paying full respect to animal protection as well. Shiseido shall proactively seek the abolition of animal testing in line with EU regulations,"" the company explains. A few weeks later, Shisieido's Korean competitor, Amore Pacific, made a similar announcement. ""Amore Pacific is responding to the wishes of our consumers,"" said the company. ""We look forward to the time when there will be a global agreement to end animal testing for cosmetics."" On this issue, the views of the industry leaders have changed dramatically. Now that the full ban on animal testing is implemented in Europe, China's maintained obligation to test cosmetics on animals is seen as both an unnecessary burden and a barrier to market access. And it is also viewed as a risk for the brands' image. Thus, a number of companies have refused to sell cosmetics in China until it becomes possible to do so without animal testing. ""Traditionally, animal protection groups and industry have been on different sides in the debate over cosmetic regulation. However, with the China FDA consultation in progress, our sister organisation Cruelty Free International has adopted the innovative approach of a joint submission with leading European companies keen to avoid mandatory animal testing in China,"" commented Cruelty Free International in a release. Thus, companies such as The Body Shop, L'Occitane, Montagne Jeunesse and Marks and Spencer have joined forces with the animal rights activists to try to change the Chinese regulations. Apparently, these pressures are producing effects gradually. The Chinese government, which until recently was hardly concerned with this issue, has repeatedly expressed there was no objection in principle to a regulatory change. After a first step consisting in the recognition of some alternative methods, the Chinese authorities have recently announced that the reform of the regulation governing cosmetic products would address this issue. The Chinese authorities have invited input from industry and other interested parties in a review of cosmetics regulation, with new proposals expected by the end of the year. China does not make a commitment to alternatives, but animal rights groups see it as an opportunity to press for positive change. ""This is the first review of Chinese policy in the area for a quarter of a century and we are eager to seize the opportunity,"" says Cruelty Free International's Chief Executive Michelle Thew. The Humane Society International also confirmed recently that Korea is to develop its first national centre of excellence for the development and validation of alternatives to animal testing. With 166 billion Korean Won (USD 145 million) allocated to the project, the centre is expected to be completed by 2016. It will focus on developing new microbial, cell, tissue and in silico approaches that can replace, reduce or refine the use of tests on animals. This change of attitude on the part of Asian authorities is more than the expression of a sudden and new attention to animal welfare. The overall aim is also to ensure the competitiveness of local industries towards regulatory developments in Europe in both the cosmetics and chemical fields (REACH)."
The hassle of importing cosmetics into China,"Along the years, the organization system of regulatory offices has been quite modified with a growing involvement of the China Food & Drug Administration (CFDA) in the cosmetics industry. It has more and more replaced the role of the Hygiene Bureau and consequently has increased the importance of toxicology and concern on impacts for consumer safety. Similarly the involvement of the powerful AQSIQ (General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine) has been increasing with recent scandals on food industry, leading to a strengthening role of the ministerial-level agency in control of cosmetics companies. As AQSIQ also administrates the Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau as well as the Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision, the respective roles of these two provincial-level entities have also grown in importance. All these constraints have been an increasing problem, in particular for small and medium size companies that have more difficulties to overcome the extra-costs. However, the worst impact of these regulations seems to be on manufacturers and importers of cosmetic ingredients. Indeed, the list of officially approved ingredients is not that much comprehensive, compared to international practices. Furthermore, as any new ingredient (i.e. which is not in the list approved by Chinese authorities) needs to pass through a very long registration process, the whole system appears a huge barrier for players of the cosmetic ingredients industry, in particular when innovation is at stake. For new comers, the barrier is high and entering into the Chinese market is not always the best strategic option. While procedures are longue and burdensome for cosmetic products that are made in China, it appears that in practice the hassle is much stronger for imported products and registration then becomes a major issue. The 5-year plan voted last year is focusing on domestic consumption, with the aim to support the Chinese industry. The context is not favourable to imported products. These politics have a real and strong impact on the business timeline the approval of imported cosmetic products is usually going through at the national level in Beijing, while the registration of domestic products is performed at the regional level. For a brand, the whole registration process would require one year in average for new products with a new formula, in particular due to the toxicology tests that must be performed in China. Such a delay may lead to tricky situations, in particular for products that must be marketed quickly, especially on some special occasions such as Chinese New Year or the upcoming Singles Day on the next November 11th."
"Fragrance allergens: Is the ""worst case scenario"" away?","In an opinion published on July 31, 2012, the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety's (SCCS) has recommended to add more than fifty fragrance components to the list of allergens that must be labelled on cosmetic products in order to inform sensitized persons that are keen to develop an allergic reaction to one of these substances. However, the Committee did not stop there. The SCCS also considered that a level of exposure up to 0.8 μg/cm² (0.01% or 100 ppm in cosmetic products) would suffice to prevent elicitation from probable allergens for the majority of individuals. This very low limit, applied to relatively common substances in perfumes, triggered a worried reaction among the industry. Especially as, at the same time, the Committee suggested a total ban of other substances such as hydroxyisohexyl 3-cyclohexene carboxaldehyde (HICC) or chloroatranol and atranol. According to the representatives of the perfumery industry, should the limits and bans suggested by the Committee be enforced, most of existing perfumes (about 90%) and the major part of skincare products (78-88%) would need to be reformulated. The three actions suggested by the Committee - the prohibition of certain substances of particular concern, the restriction of use for a range of other substances, to limit the increase in allergies, and additional labelling requirements for better information of people already allergic - should remain in the draft regulation to be presented by the Commission in October. The perfume industry made several remarks, in particular regarding the 100 ppm threshold for probable allergens identified by the SCCS. Instead of a maximum concentration applicable to all allergens and products, the industry would prefer a Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) calculation, namely a maximum allergen concentration for each allergen in a given product. According to the industry, this would enable to better manage risk, to protect people who are not sensitized, while avoiding unnecessary restrictions. Regarding new labelling requirements, the representatives of industry and of Member States have deemed that the period of two years initially proposed by the Commission was too short. The Commission has confirmed that she was considering a possibility reconsider this delay. Questioned by MEP Gaston Franco, the European Commission confirmed in June that it was exploring the possibility of implementing the QRA method and that it would ask the CSSC to assess it suitability to serve as a basis for the development of future regulatory measures. While they prefer remain cautious, fragrance manufacturers hope their view will betaken into consideration by the Commission. Anyway, the text that will be presented in October will be the result of negotiations between the different stakeholders. The regulatory draft that will be presented in October will be submitted to public consultation during an 8 week period. Then the Commission will have the possibility to reshape its text again before submitting it to the European Parliament."
European Commission plans to restrict the use of MCI and MI,"Dermatologists, in particular in France and in the United Kingdom, have raised the alarm on a ""contact allergy epidimedic"" allegedly caused by two cosmetic ingredients, methylisothiazolinone (MI) and a mixture of methylchloroisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone (MCI/MI), used as preservatives in some cosmetic products as well as in certain household products. A study released at the British Association of Dermatologists' Annual Conference, which was held in Liverpool in July, showed a sharp rise (up to 6.2 per cent sensitivity) in contact allergy to MCI/MI and MI over the past three years. [1] This was also reported by a team of researchers at St John's Institute for Dermatology at St Thomas' Hospital in London who had seen a rapid rise in contact allergy to MI in the last two years going from one case in 2010 to 33 cases in 2012. [2] According to the British Association of Dermatologists, other dermatology centres across the UK are also noticing rapid rises in numbers of acute allergic contact dermatitis related to MI exposure. British researchers suspected that the recent use of MI as a single agent preservative in quantities up to 100 ppm in personal care products may be a major contributor to this outbreak of MI allergy. ""Across the large patch test centres in the UK, data suggest that rates of allergy to these two preservatives are now nearing 10 per cent – and in some cases higher – this is clearly far too high and is an unacceptable situation,"" said David Orton, President of the British Society of Cutaneous Allergy. ""The last time a preservative had this type of effect it was banned by the EU,"" he added. In the wake of the release of these two study, reports in the British press also called for immediate ban on methylisothiazolinone. ""This is a complex issue and the cosmetics industry is committed to working in partnership with dermatologists, the broader scientific community and regulatory authorities to find out what this means for the population at large and how it can be most effectively managed in a timely manner. Preservatives are essential in many consumer products, including cosmetics. Simply banning MI could have unforeseen consequences, so whatever action is taken it must be done with all the facts in front of us to ensure it is the most appropriate in the circumstances,"" commented the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association (CTPA), the voice of the cosmetic, toiletry and perfumery industry in the UK. For its part, the Commission proposed to amend Annex V of Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 on cosmetic products in order to limit the use of the mixture of methylchloroisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone (MCI/MI) to rinse-off products and clearly indicate that the use of this mixture is incompatible with the use of methylisothiazolinone (MI) alone, because the 3:1 ratio in the mixture would be affected (see document here below). The proposed implementation dates are: six months, after the date of entry into force of the restriction, to place on the market compliant products, and twelve months, after the date of entry into force of the restriction, to withdraw from the market non-compliant products after the entry into force of this Regulation. Interested parties can send their comments regarding the proposed ruling to the European Commission by mail or e-mail by 8 October 2013 at the latest."
The European cosmetics regulation enters into force,"As of today, cosmetics marketed in the European union [1] must be fully compliant with the cosmetics regulation [2] replacing the Directive that was applicable so far. ""For the first time, the world's largest personal care market of more than 500 million consumers will be served by a single, harmonised piece of legislation, directly applicable in all the Member States of the European Union. The regulation both gives consumers a uniform level of protection in a single market, and brings unprecedented clarity for industry,"" commented Bertil Heerink, Director-General of Cosmetics Europe, the trade association representing the European cosmetics and personal care industry. Indeed, unlike a directive, a European regulation does not need to be transposed into the law of Member State: it is directly and immediately applicable. In short, everyone must comply with it in the same way. According to Neven Mimica, European Commissioner for Consumer Policy, the regulation makes ""enforcement easier, bringing greater peace of mind and confidence in the products purchased."" The Cosmetics Regulation provides more accurate definitions of certain existing legal provisions, reproduces the previous requirements and also adds new one. The main changes are: – Strengthened safety requirements for cosmetic products: As of today, manufacturers need to follow specific requirements in the preparation of a product safety report prior to placing a product on the market. – Introduction of the notion of ""responsible person"": Only cosmetic products for which a legal or natural person is designated within the EU as 'responsible person' can be placed on the market. The new Cosmetics Regulation allows the precise identification of who the responsible person is and clearly outlines the obligations. The responsible person must also keep the product information file, including the safety assessment of the product, available and up-to-date in case of inspection of the national market surveillance authorities. – Centralized notification of all cosmetic products placed on the EU market: Manufacturer will need to notify its product only once - via the EU Cosmetic Products Notification Portal (CPNP), which has been started several months ago. The information stored in the portal will allow the personnel of national Anti-Poison Centres to access the composition of the products within seconds, in case of accidents, and the competent authorities to easily access information on all the cosmetic products placed on the EU market for market surveillance purposes. – Introduction of reporting of serious undesirable effects: a responsible person will have an obligation to notify serious undesirable effects to competent national authorities. The authorities will also collect information coming from e.g. users and health professionals, and will be obliged to share the information with other EU Member States. – New rules for the use of nanomaterials in cosmetic products: Colorants, preservatives and UV-filters, including those that are nanomaterials, must be explicitly authorized. Products containing other nanomaterials not otherwise restricted by the Cosmetics Regulation will be the object of a full safety assessment at the EU level, if the Commission has concerns. Nanomaterials must be labelled in the list of ingredients with the word 'nano' in brackets following the name of the substance, e.g. ""titanium dioxide (nano)"". In addition, a new Commission Regulation adopted yesterday sets out common criteria for cosmetic claims [3] (here below). Manufacturers wanting to put a claim on their product, e.g. ""48 hrs efficiency"" for deodorants, will have to follow six common criteria: legal compliance, truthfulness, evidential support, honesty, fairness and informed-decision making. National competent authorities will be able to check claims against these criteria."
"Commissioner Borg sees ""first signs of acceptance of alternative methods in China""","Following a four-day visit to China, where he took part in several high-ranking meetings focusing among others, on product safety, medical devices, cross-border health threats and cooperation in the area of animal diseases control and anti-microbial resistance, EU Commissioner Tonio Borg said he also used his stay ""as an opportunity to have an exchange with the Chinese authorities on the European ban on animal testing for cosmetics, which applies fully since 11 March 2013."" Indeed, testing cosmetics on live animals is still legally required in China and this strong divergence of legal requirements poses difficulties to the both Chinese and the European cosmetics industry. ""I have encouraged the Chinese authorities to avoid unnecessary testing for cosmetics. There are many areas where animal testing can be replaced, for example, where the proof of safety can be based on ingredients. In this case, the respect of animals as well as the costs of animal tests speak in favour of not doing them,"" said Commissioner Borg. ""I see first signs of acceptance of alternative methods in China which I welcome very much,"" he added. According to Mr. Borg, acceptance by Chinese authorities of OECD validated alternative methods ""is clearly key to limit animal testing for cosmetics internationally."" ""I invited the Chinese authorities to work in closer cooperation with the EU Joint Research Centre in the area of alternative methods. Here we have already had first promising contacts. In the same vein, I have also welcomed China's participation as an observer at the next meeting of the International Cooperation on Cosmetics Regulation, aiming for acceptance of validated alternative methods at international level."" Borg's statements were warmly welcomed by animal-rights organisations. ""Commissioner Borg's intervention is hugely significant, and paves the way for further progress towards ending cosmetics animal testing worldwide. China, unlike other markets, requires animal testing for cosmetics products already safely on sale in the EU and elsewhere, so the Commissioner's statement is particularly welcome,"" commented Humane Society International's Be Cruelty-Free Campaigns Director, Troy Seidle."
"Serious Adverse Effects: ""The implementation of specific procedures is essential""","Premium Beauty News - What is the situation like in Europe today in terms of cosmetovigilance? Nedjwa Abbadi - Currently the amended Directive 76/768/EEC governing the placing on the market of cosmetic products in the member countries of the EU, does not provide for a harmonised cosmetovigilance system. No one can deny that the situation is quite disparate depending of countries mainly because of Member States regulatory specificities. In some countries, like France, Portugal and Norway, a cosmetovigilance system is formalized and formally implemented. In other countries, it is in the process of being implemented, this is the case in the Netherlands, Italy and Spain. Elsewhere, a simple system of incentives for the declaration is effective for health professionals and manufacturers, with no real formal framework. This is the case in Belgium, Ireland, Sweden or Denmark. Premium Beauty News - But this should change as of 11 July 2013 with the entry into force of the Regulation 1223/2009? Nedjwa Abbadi - Indeed! Firstly, the new Regulation defines what is meant by ""adverse"" and ""serious adverse reaction"" [1] and, mostly, clarifies the obligations of the responsible person for placing on the market and of the distributors in the occurrence of such events and also the obligations of Member States. As this new regulatory framework is now supported by a Regulation and no longer, as was the case until now, by a Directive, these obligations will apply uniformly to all operators inside the EU and the European Economic Area. Upon entry into force of the Regulation, people will have to comply with these new rules. They will be directly applicable, It is no longer a question, as before, of ""transposition"" by Member States. Premium Beauty News - And what are these new requirements? Nedjwa Abbadi - Article 23 of the new Regulation requires that the responsible person and the distributors notify certain information to the authorities in the occurrence of serious adverse effects. They must describe these effects, indicating the name of the cosmetic product(s) concerned – so that it/they may be identified – and specify the corrective actions taken, if any. These new obligations complement those already provided for in the amended Directive 76/768/EEC, which are to make easily available to the public, the existing data on the undesirable effects. Premium Beauty News - How can this be organized in practice? Emmanuelle Amsler - This is the tricky bit! The management of serious cases requires both skills and the setting up of specific procedures that must complement those used in ""classic"" cases of cosmetovigilance. This is not specific to serious cases, but of course the feedback on these cases will need to be organized. People will also need – and this is new – to be very reactive because the deadline for reporting serious cases is only of 20 calendar days from the time when any person in the company is informed of the case. Finally, the person will need to be able to decide on the seriousness of a case and have sufficiently documented it to then fill in a notification form and send it to the competent authorities of the country of occurrence. If we focus on what is meant by severity, the regulation defines severe cases according to 6 criteria: temporary or permanent functional incapacity, disability, hospitalization, congenital anomalies, immediate vital risk or death. However, the exact definition for some of these criteria remains unclear. Let's take for example, temporary functional disability, how can it be considered in an objective and reproducible way? How to judge a functional disability in a pensioner, a school child or a housewife? Even sick leave is not easy to handle because there are some variations depending of the labour law and health systems in the different European countries. About hospitalization, it is quite clear that a simple visit to the hospital emergency service is not within its scope, but is there a clear definition of hospitalization for all countries concerned by the Regulation? The reporting of information, for serious cases, is important. The possible entry doors need to be identified for consumers, educate and inform the teams involved in the detection of the level of seriousness (which needs to be clearly differentiated from severity) because they will be the first links in the chain. Another issue is to be able to properly qualify these events. With of course the use of specific standardized questionnaires, but in the case of serious cases, the medical documents provided by consumers, and in their native language (medical certificates, hospitalization report, copy of the sick leave report, ...), will need to be decrypted! In summary, at this stage, brands will need to have organized themselves and anticipated the answers to some key questions: Who fills in and sends the form to the competent authorities? Who monitors the case? Who ensures the relationship with the authorities? Premium Beauty News - And at the distributor level? Emmanuelle Amsler - Indeed, they are subject to the obligation of notifying severe cases the same way as the responsible person. Distributors are in direct contact with consumers, we can imagine that in the event of problems it is to them that they will turn to spontaneously. They also need to organize and structure their relationship with the responsible person. Premium Beauty News - Some difference of opinion will certainly arise with authorities? Emmanuelle Amsler - It is indeed conceivable, depending on differences in experience in terms of cosmetovilance between the different EU Member States, for some differences of opinion in the assessment of cases, to occur. Today it is difficult to anticipate what is going to happen. There will certainly be a need to communicate/explain/argue in the case of divergence on a case. Premium Beauty News - What can you bring to brands? Emmanuelle Amsler - IRIS is a unique centre of vigilance which, with over 20 years of experience, offers assistance and support to brands in the investigation of their cases of cosmetovigilance. At the request of brands, we contact the consumers concerned to collect the relevant and specific data on the adverse effect reported. Then, depending on the case, we can propose a contact over the phone with a physician, or a consultation with a possible allergy investigation (tests with the product, and if necessary its ingredients). All this helps to document the case, an essential step in its appraisal. Once the investigation is completed, an internally validated conclusion by a physician is sent to the brand. This document specifies in particular the diagnosis for the presented reaction, if it is possible to make one, and the evaluation of the accountability between the use of the product and the adverse effects reported. With the new Regulation, and the management of severe cases, this mission is still topical and IRIS has complemented its services to assist brands in their regulatory obligations, particularly by making an assessment on the severity and by helping them to fill the notification forms."
European Union: Full ban on animal testing for cosmetics enters into force,"The European Commission has announced, in a communication adopted today, the entry into force of the full marketing ban of cosmetic products for which test on animals have bee performed. Testing finished cosmetic products on animals has been prohibited in the European Union (EU) since 2004, as with animal testing of ingredients since 2009. In addition to these prohibitions, after March 2009 there has been a marketing ban on selling cosmetic products within the EU containing ingredients that have been tested on animals after this date, irrespective of the place of testing. However, some very complex tests [1], for which there is currently no alternative method available, the deadline for the marketing ban was extended to 11 March 2013. According to European Commissioner in charge of Health & Consumer Policy, Tonio Borg, this decision ""gives an important signal on the value that Europe attaches to animal welfare."" The European Commission deemed that, despite the difficulties linked to the lack of alternative methods for replacing certain of the tests that are required to ensure the safety of consumers, maintaining the 2013 marketing ban was preferable to the other options: postponing it or introducing a derogation mechanism for innovative ingredients with a significant added value to consumer health, well-being and/or the environment. ""This is in line with what many European citizens believe firmly: that the development of cosmetics does not warrant animal testing"" the Commission says. ""If product safety cannot be demonstrated the product simply cannot be placed on the market,"" it adds. In the same time, the Commission intends ""to continue supporting the development of alternative methods and to engage with third countries to follow our European approach."" The Communication published today outlines the Commission's contribution to the research into alternative methods and the recognition that these efforts must be continued. The Commission has made about 238 million euros available between the years 2007 and 2011 for such research. The cosmetics industry has contributed as well, for example by co-funding with EUR 25 million the SEURAT1 research initiative, a five year research initiative, which was launched to develop a consistent strategy for the replacement of in vivo repeated dose systemic toxicity testing. In order to continue these efforts, the Commission will engage with stakeholders to define the research priorities going ahead and the best implementation instruments which, for example, could take the form of a new public-private partnership. Cosmetics Europe, the organisation representing the European cosmetics industry, said the entry into force of the marketing ban for cosmetic products containing ingredients tested on animals ignores the reality that science is not yet ready to bridge existing knowledge gaps and that non-animal alternatives cannot address all ingredient safety questions. ""The ban acts as a brake on innovation for the European cosmetics industry while achieving little to improve global animal welfare,"" claims the trade organisation in a release. ""It is our hope that today's deadline will provide the impetus for even greater collaboration between our industry's scientists, regulators and the wider scientific community. This will be vital to address those challenging areas where non-animal tests are not yet available to assure safety. Since we will not compromise on safety, there will be innovations that will not be available to European consumers first in future,"" commented Dr Chris Flower, Director-General of the CTPA, the UK cosmetic trade association. As far as animal welfare NGOs are concerned, comments were very positive. ""With the sales ban, the EU becomes the world's largest cruelty-free cosmetics market,"" said the Humane Society International in a release. The organisation now aims at replicating the EU testing and sales bans around the world."
Animal testing: EU Commission confirms full ban will take effect in March,"The European coalition of leading animal protection organisations across Europe (ECEAE), the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) as well as Cruelty Free International and People for the Ethical treatment of Animals (PETA) have celebrated the achievement of their long-run campaign to end animal testing by the cosmetics industry in Europe. Indeed, the new commissioner for health and consumer policy, Tonio Borg wrote in a letter to animal testing campaigners, ""I believe that the ban should enter into force in March 2013 as Parliament and Council have already decided. I am therefore not planning to propose a postponement or derogation to the ban."" Mr Borg also confirmed this position in a recent meeting with animal rights organisation in Brussels. As a consequence, the full ban should take effect in little more than a month, on the 11th of March 2013, as scheduled. ""PETA has responded by sending a huge bouquet of flowers in thanks and is encouraging supporters to do the same,"" said the organization in a release, and Cruelty Free International Chief Executive, Michelle Thew, said this is ""the culmination of over 20 years of campaigning."" ""We were aware - via the public calendar - that Commissioner Borg was meeting with a delegation from BUAV and other NGOs on Wednesday [January 30]. Such meetings are commonplace for European Commissioners,"" said Colin Mackay, Communications Director at Cosmetics Europe, which represents the interests of the cosmetics industry in Europe. ""The confirmation of the ban has been in the public domain for some time, so from the perspective of Cosmetics Europe, this was not a notable development,"" he added. Testing finished cosmetic products on animals has been prohibited in the European Union (EU) since 2004, as with animal testing of ingredients since 2009. In addition to these prohibitions, after March 2009 there has been a marketing ban on selling cosmetic products within the EU containing ingredients that have been tested on animals after this date, irrespective of the place of testing. However, some very complex tests [1] remain exempted from these various prohibitions until a general marketing ban comes into force in March 2013. While the cosmetics-testing ban has driven the development of non-animal testing methods, which can replace the use of animals in certain safety testing procedures, there are still important safety areas where alternative tests are lacking. Last year, several European scientific committees have expressed doubts about the possibility to combine this final ban with the goal to reach the highest level of safety for consumers, in particular in emerging fields such as the use of nanoparticles in cosmetic products. So far, as no official text was issued to detail the conditions under which the full ban would enter into application, most of important questions for the industry therefore remain unsolved."
Animal testing: the future Commissioner commits to introduce full ban,"Questioned by members of the European Parliament on 13 November, the Maltese candidate gave its position on issues that will fall under its jurisdiction. The procedure is not a formality, in 2004 and 2010 MEPs have already obtained the withdrawal of candidates commissioners who failed to give appropriate answers to some of their questions. Cosmetics Europe, the trade association representing the cosmetics industry in Europe, said that prospective Commissioner Tonio Borg's commitment to ""conclude the introduction of the March 2013 ban without addressing the scientific reality or consumer needs is an issue of great concern."" ""Our industry commitment to ending animal testing is solid and widely recognised, and we continue to invest heavily into finding viable alternatives. The cosmetics industry has been the engine of progress in this area. Mr. Borg's comments therefore do not reflect the complexity or the reality of the issue, and will not further the cause of global animal welfare; rather it will undermine it,"" commented Fabio Franchina, the President of Cosmetics Europe. Testing finished cosmetic products on animals has been prohibited in the European Union (EU) since 2004, as with animal testing of ingredients since 2009. In addition to these prohibitions, after March 2009 there has been a marketing ban on selling cosmetic products within the EU containing ingredients that have been tested on animals after this date, irrespective of the place of testing. However, some very complex tests [1] remain exempted from these various prohibitions until a general marketing ban comes into force in March 2013. Several European scientific committees have expressed doubts about the possibility to combine this final ban with the goal to reach the highest level of safety for consummers. On the contrary, animal advocacy groups have welcomed Mr Borg's position. The British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) and the European Coalition to End Animal Experiments (ECEAE) said they agree with Tonio Borg's comments that industry would not find alternative means of testing if the marketing ban is not implemented as ""necessity is the mother of invention."" As it happens quite often on this issue, it has taken a political turn with several MEPs and political groups who included the respect of the March 2013 deadline as a condition of their vote in favour of Tonio Borg. The Conference of Presidents of the EU Parliament has set the date for the vote on Tonio Borg's nomination for next Wednesday, 21st of November 2012."
China strengthens regulations governing cosmetics for children,"According to the directive recently published by the China's State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) on its website (www.sfda.gov.cn), cosmetic products intended for children under 12 years of age will now have to comply with a list of specific criteria in order to get registered. The aim of the Guide for the Application and Review of Children's Cosmetics is to standardise the application and technical review of children's cosmetics aged of 12 or less. The text specifies the scope of application, principles of formulation, safety of cosmetics, application requirements for children's cosmetics and review principles. The text provides, in particular, that the packaging of the concerned products should be marked with a clear and unambiguous indication that they are intended for children. As far as ingredients are concerned, the text recommends avoid using, or use less, ""resinoid, colouring agents, antiseptic and surface-active agents."" Ingredients designed for skin whitening, for the lightening of freckles, for acne treatment, hair removal, for stopping perspiration, deodorising, or for hair waving and dying, or breast care and muscle enhancement are ""not appropriate"" in children's cosmetics. The SFDA also provides that the manufacturers of such products should prefer substances with a long history of safe use. In particular, ingredients derived from with genetic or nano technologies should not be used. However, the new text remains vague on possible acceptable levels for these substances and does not mention any concentration limit. The risk assessment must take into account the particularities of children's metabolism as well as the way products are used and substances contained in the formulation that are likely to promote skin penetration of ingredients. The presence of colonies of microorganisms in cosmetics for children is limited to 500 CFU/mL or 500 CFU/g. The SFDA will refer to these recommendations for the registration of products intended for children of 12 of age and under from the 1st February 2013. The text (in Chinese) of these guidelines is available here below or on the website of the SFDA: www.sfda.gov.cn"
"Customs Union Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan: placing cosmetics on the market","The Technical Regulation on the safety of cosmetic products TR TC 009/2011Adopted on 23 September 2011 by the Commission of the Customs Union (Decree No. 799). aims at a better harmonisation of requirements applying to cosmetic products in the member countries of the Customs Union - Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan - with the European rules [1]. Actually, the text that entered into force on the July 1, 2012, still contains a lot of specificities. As far as labelling is concerned, the Technical Regulation requires several additional constraints when compared to the rules of the European Union. These include: – The mention of the name and address of the company, registered in the territory of the Customs Union, responsible for the distribution of products, – The indication of the shade (or the dye) for makeup and hair dye products, – The indication of fluorine contents by weight, for oral hygiene products, – The expiry date and the date of manufacture of the product, – The Eurasian conformity mark. Regarding technical requirements, Regulation TR TC 009/2011 draws its inspiration from the European legislation (a negative list of substances that are prohibited in cosmetics, a restrictive list of substances which cosmetic products may contain only under certain conditions, and positive lists of the only substances that can be used in cosmetics as colour agents, preservatives or UV filters). However, the text also regulates the pH value of products, their microbiology and various other aspects not detailed in the European Directive 76/768 and its amendments, or in theRegulation (EC) No 1223/2009 which will replace the Directive from July 2013. Moreover, while for the majority of products a declaration of conformity is enough, the Technical Regulation TC TR 009/2011 also lists a number of products for which registration is still needed: – Self-tanners, – Skin bleaching products, – Products for tattoo, – Hygiene products, – Cosmetics for children, – Hair dyes and professional products for hair perms and hair straightening, – Hair removal products, – Peels, – Oral care products, – Teeth whiteners. For these products, the registration is a prerequisite for the placing on the market. For imported products, it must be completed prior to clearance the Union's customs. The registration procedure consists of three main steps: 1. Evaluation of the technical and administrative file provided by the manufacturer, which includes a Certificate of Free Sale, a GMP statement or the corresponding ISO certificate, the composition of products, labels or their draft in Russian signed and stamped by the manufacturer or an authorized representative of the manufacturer, samples, etc.. [2] 2. Toxicological testing and clinical trials in laboratories accredited according to the regulations of the Customs Union 3. The recording of the product's and manufacturer's data as well as test results in the single sanitary database of Customs Union; Then the registration certificate is issued, it is valid for the entire life of the product. For products that are not subject to registration, a declaration of conformity is sufficient. This can be done only by legal entities registered in Russia or in other countries of the Customs Union."
France to assess environmental information one year test,"The wish to require companies to provide the public with information on the environmental impact of their products has emerged in France during the ""Grenelle Environnement"", a set of negotiations between environmental NGOs and industry sectors, which aimed at modernising French environmental policies. However, technical difficulties have led French authorities to start with an experimental phase, scheduled to last a minimum of one year, before deciding whether to go further, for instance by proposing to extend such a requirement at European level. A total of 168 companies, of which 8 cosmetics companies [1] , participated in the experimental phase, which was launched in July 2011. ""The experiment focuses on both the product and the packaging,"" says Juliette Mélédié, Director of Economic, Environmental and International Affairs at the French Federation of Beauty Companies (FEBEA). France made the choice of a multi-criteria approach, not limited to Greenhouse Gas Emissions, and based on life cycle analysis (LCA) using calculation methods identical for each product category. As far as cosmetics are concerned, a standard for shampoos and shower gels was published on April 2011. The goals of the experimental phase are: to enable consumers to use environmental criteria for their purchasing decisions, to raise public awareness about the environmental impact of manufactured goods and to provide businesses with the opportunity to promote their environmental commitments. To simplify the way the information is communicated to the public, the French Consumer Industries Research Institute (ILEC) and its partners [2]have proposed to harmonise both the semantic and the logos. A full assessment of the first year of experimentation is in progress and will be submitted to the Parliament in early 2013. Juliette Mélédié emphasizes that the multi-criteria approach eventually proved relevant. ""In addition to greenhouse gas emissions, most often selected indicators include water and biodiversity."" Most companies chose to display the environmental information through the internet. ""Only one out three companies displayed the information on the product or on the point of sale,"" says Juliette Mélédié. According to Jean-Florent Campion, International Sustainable Development Manager at L'Oréal, the outcome of the participation of the French cosmetics giant in the experimentation - through its Garnier Ultra-Doux brand - is rather mitigated. ""A total of 19 products, representing 10% of the French shampoo market, were involved in this testing phase."" The main difficulty, he said, was the lack of accurate data that implied using general databases. ""In the event the display of environmental information would become a general requirement, it would be necessary to set up complex logistics and information systems."" Jean-Florent Campion also points out the uncertainties linked to the LCA method. Due to the lack of precision of the data used, the difference between two products would be significant only beyond 15 to 20%. In the case of Garnier products, the results were posted on the website of the brand. Studies conducted among consumers receiving news form the brand's website showed a very good value given to the initiative and a good understanding of the information provided. However, a larger study conducted in partnership with Carrefour showed that the retailer's customers, while being highly interested in the initiative, lack of confidence in the information provided to them and are only marginally influenced by it when it comes to purchasing shampoo. As far as L'Occitane - another participant in the experimentation phase - is concerned, the findings are quite similar. The brand conducted the test on a shea butter hand cream, since it has a good control and knowledge on the supply chain for this product. The environmental information was display on the brand's website but also in its shops. ""It has been necessary to train the sales staff, to learn how to respond to customers' questions, including providing practical advice,"" says Marielle Le Roux, Head of the Eco-Design Project, at L'Occitane en Provence. According to Marielle Le Roux, the main lessons learned from this experiment are the strong mobilization of the brand's team, but in the end, only few feedbacks from consumers. ""The generalization of this requirement would involve improving the databases and methods that are currently available, but also clarifying the scope of the information to display,"" she says. Many technical and practical hurdles still have to be overcome before public authorities can actually consider generalizing the environmental information requirement. However, French and European governments are likely to support the continuation of efforts made towards this direction. More details available from the BeautyFull Club: www.beautyfullclub.com"
Lancôme stumbles over U.S. regulations,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the authority controlling drugs and cosmetics marketed in the United States, sent Lancôme a warning letter involving claims associated with a series of the brand's skincare products [1]. The FDA says to have reviewed Lancôme's US website and identified, for some products, a series of claims that are should not be considered as belonging to the cosmetic category. The U.S. agency gives some examples of claims that could be considered as litigious, for instance: ""Boosts the activity of genes and stimulates the production of youth proteins"", "" See significant deep wrinkle reduction in UV damaged skin, clinically proven"". According to the FDA, these claims are problematic because they imply that the concerned products are intended to affect the structure or any function of the human body, they are therefore pharmaceutical claims, according to the U.S. law. The agency also states that its warning letter is not an all-inclusive statement and that the brand is responsible for ensuring the compliance of all its products with all the U.S. regulations. Actually, what does the FDA reproach Lancôme is the nature of the claims. The agency does not question whether they are true or not. Indeed, as provided by the U.S. regulations and according to the FDA's point of view, a product producing the effects claimed by Lancôme is not a cosmetic but a drug. Under U.S. law, drugs are defined as ""articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals; and articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals"". [2] In practice, the border between cosmetics and drugs is far from being as clear in the United States as it is within the European regulatory framework, and a claim considered as ""medical"" may be enough to switch from the first to the second category. In such a context, how to decide whether a product is a cosmetic, a drug, or both? Under the U.S. law, this is determined by a product's intended use. The type of claims stated on the product labelling, in advertising, on the Internet, or in other promotional materials, is the first tool used by the FDA to determine whether a product is a cosmetic or a drug. Consumer perception and ingredients in the product also have to be taken into account. The L'Oréal's brand is not the first to stumble over the intricacies of the U.S. regulation that fundamentally differs from the legal framework in which European brands are used to work. Thus, one can find on the FDA's website, a ""yellow list"" of all businesses to which the federal agency sent warnings due to the medical nature (under U.S. law) of their claims. Actually, most of the big names in the cosmetics business are listed, among any others. Before another name be dropped on the list, Lancôme has 15 days to submit the FDA with its arguments or the corrective measures it intends to take."
Morocco requires registration of cosmetic products,"Cosmetic products will now be subject to registration prior to their marketing on the Moroccan market. According to the Circular No. 48 DMP/20 published on August 17th by the Moroccan Health Ministry, cosmetic manufacturers or importers must now file a product registration application with the Direction du Médicament et de la Pharmacie (DMP). According to Moroccan Health Minister al-Hussein al-Ouardi, this text aims to protect the health of Moroccan consumers by guaranteeing the ""quality, efficiency, safety of use of the cosmetic and hygiene products available on the domestic marketplace."" The Minister also stated that this procedure was introduced on a temporary basis ""pending the enactment of a specific regulation in this area"". The circular sets out a number of general principles very similar to those of the EU Directive 76/768/EEC and also explicitly refers to the Annexes of this text. It thus provides that ""cosmetic products put on the market must not cause damage to human health when applied under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use, taking account, in particular, of the product's presentation, its labelling, any instructions for its use and disposal as well as any other indication or information provided by the manufacturer or his authorized agent or by any other person responsible for placing the products on the market"". The circular prohibits the use in cosmetics of ""substances known to be carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction"". Furthermore, it also creates a Commission of Cosmetology in charge of examining registration applications and to advise the Minister of Health on all matters concerning the suspension, removal or prohibition of sale of cosmetics. To be registered, a cosmetic product shall comply with the requirements stated in the circular, particularly concerning its safety, composition and labelling. The manufacturer, packer or importer of the product must also have declared their activity and have some qualified staff in charge of quality control and of the evaluation of the products' safety. The registration file consists of an administrative and of a technical part. In addition to the usual elements (corporate identity, product identification, etc.), the administrative part must also include a certificate of free sale and an acknowledgement letter from the poison control and pharmacovigilance centre. The technical part includes: the qualitative and quantitative composition of the product, the raw materials monographs and specifications, the microbiological specifications, the analytical results of the finished products, the name and addresses of the qualified and responsible persons, the claim substantiation, etc. Once issued, the marketing authorization is valid for 5 years. The application for renewal must be submitted three months before its expiry date. The text of the circular can be read (in French or in Arabic) on the website of the Moroccan Ministry of Health: www.sante.gov.ma"
EU expert panel paves the way to a longer list of allergens requiring label disclosure,"In order to protect the secret of their composition, the fragrances used in cosmetics are exempted from the full labelling of their ingredients. With the exception of substances identified as potential allergens, all the ingredients in a perfume composition are therefore gathered under the terms ""parfum"" or ""aroma"". To date, the list of substances identified as potential allergens includes 26 entries (including, Limonene, Eugenol, Cinnamal, Benzyl Benzoate, etc.). These 26 fragrance ingredients must be labelled so as patients who know the cause of their allergy are able to avoid cosmetics that will cause reactions. According to the SCCS, the frequency of contact allergy to fragrance ingredients in the general population in Europe is 1-3%. However, the real prevalence of contact allergy may be higher, as the testing is made with a limited number of ingredients out of the 2,500 fragrance ingredients listed in the European database of cosmetic ingredients. Thus, around 16% of eczema patients in the European population are sensitised to fragrance ingredients. In its new opinion, the SCCS lists fragrance ingredients that are established contact allergens in humans, based on results from human clinical and epidemiological evidence. The list includes the 26 ingredients already identified and an additional 30 individual chemicals and 26 natural extracts. Furthermore, the SCCS also lists fragrance allergens likely to cause allergies in humans and says that a level of exposure up to 0.8 μg/cm² (0.01% in cosmetic products) would suffice to prevent elicitation for the majority of allergic individuals. Based on the SCCS opinion, the Commission will now consider the appropriate regulatory measures and will likely extend the list of fragrance allergens required to be disclosed on cosmetic labels. The SCCS opinion is available at the following address: http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/consumer_safety/docs/sccs_o_102.pdf"
New ISO standard to evaluate protection against UVA,"The standard ISO 24443:2012, Determination of sunscreen UVA photoprotection in vitro, gives specifications for an in vitro procedure to characterize the UVA protection of sunscreen products in accordance with a methodology defined. With the better understanding of the negative effects of UVA radiation, consumers have been warned about the risks sun exposure and regulations have been strengthened at a global level, leading consumers to develop large spectrum sunscreen products covering UVB and UVA as well. In particular, UVA rays play an important role in premature skin ageing linked to sun exposure. ""UVA rays are not as powerful as those of UVB, but they are more abundant and penetrate the skin to a greater depth. This then leads to a slackening of tissue, a loss of skin firmness and the appearance of wrinkles. These rays penetrate so deeply that they can lead to genetic changes, affecting DNA, and resulting in the onset of skin cancer. UVA is also responsible for triggering photosensitizations in reaction to the consumption of certain pharmaceuticals,"" says ISO in a release. The new standard was developed by the ISO technical committee devoted to cosmetic products. ""The trade in cosmetics between different countries is increasing. ISO 24443:2012 will be an important tool in improving the quality and safety of sunscreen products and facilitating their global trade. It will also help manufacturers to better respond to local requirements for sunscreen products and give better information to consumers,"" comments Pr. Philippe Masson, Chair of the ISO group of experts that developed the standards. The standard ISO 24443:2012 is available from ISO national member institutes - such as BSI in the UK, ANSI in the USA, or SCC in Canada - as well as from the ISO Central Secretariat."
EU Scientific Committee warns on the impossibility to assess the risk of nanomaterials in cosmetics,"Cosmetics manufacturers may find themselves at an impasse when they seek to comply with two apparently clashing requirements in the cosmetics legislation. Indeed, the EU's Cosmetics Directive [1], which will be replaced by the EU's Cosmetics Regulation [2] as of July 11, 2013, has been phasing out animal testing progressively. Testing finished cosmetic products on animals has been prohibited in the European Union (EU) since 2004, as with animal testing of ingredients since 2009. In addition to these, after March 2009 there has been a marketing ban on selling cosmetic products within the EU containing ingredients that have been tested on animals after this date, irrespective of the place of testing. However, some very complex tests [3] remain exempted from these various prohibitions until a full marketing ban comes into force in March 2013. In parallel, article 16 of the Cosmetics Regulation will impose strict conditions and timelines for the notification and the assessment of cosmetic products containing nanomaterials. Unfortunately, validated alternative methods that can be used to replace animal tests are only available for conventional substances, and not for nanomaterials. ""This poses an insurmountable obstacle to the safety assessment of cosmetic nanomaterials, and further research work is needed in this area,"" says the SCCS in a recently published Guidance on the Safety Assessment of Nanomaterials [4]. The publication of this Guidance is aimed at providing scientific and technical information to cosmetics companies in order to comply with the requirements for safety assessment of nanomaterials intended for use their products. The document highlights that in view of the possible distinct properties, interactions, and/or effects that may differ from conventional form of the same materials, the safety assessment of nanomaterials requires special considerations. The SCCS considers that in the absence of a sufficient knowledgebase on nanomaterial properties, behaviour, and effects a category approach to risk assessment is currently not feasible, and risk assessment of each nanomaterial needs to be carried out on a case-by-case basis. Material characterisation appears as the first step and as an essential requirement of risk assessment. Then the SCCS suggests the process should be driven by considerations of exposure. Eventually, where application of a nanomaterial containing cosmetic product can lead to systemic exposure, data on toxicological evaluation will be required. It is precisely at this step that the current lack of alternative methods that are specifically validated for nanomaterials, combined with a complete ban on in vivo testing of cosmetic ingredients and products in 2013 ""poses an obstacle to the risk assessment of cosmetic ingredients in general, and ingredients in nanomaterial form in particular,"" says the SCCS. The Committee also insists on the fact that the field of nanomaterial risk assessment is still evolving and that its opinion is based on the currently available knowledge. ""The guidance may therefore be revised in the light of new scientific knowledge in the future."""
"""Our goal is the safe enjoyment of fragrances for all,"" Stephen Weller, IFRA","Premium Beauty News - Can you briefly picture IFRA's missions? Stephen Weller - It's a fact almost universally known that trade associations promote, protect and help the industry professionals they exist to serve. In IFRA's case, we not only have the role of promoting the industry but also of policing it. This voluntary approach puts us in a difficult position and leads to misunderstanding of what we actually do. Premium Beauty News - Even within the industry? Stephen Weller - On one hand, those who know, or are members of, IFRA understand just how hard the organisation works to defend the industry and ensure safe use and enjoyment of fragrances. On the other hand are those who believe that, far from being defender of the industry, IFRA is spoiling the alchemy of the perfumer's art by banning and limiting the use of certain materials. Premium Beauty News - Actually, some perfumers apparently consider that things are going too far. They deem other options, less stringent than bans, could lead to similar results for the safety of consumers. Stephen Weller - IFRA has in fact delivered some very positive results. Far from banning certain materials, IFRA has in fact been protecting them from potential bans. A material such as oak-moss would have disappeared if it hadn't been for IFRA. The EU would have abolished it. In fact, thanks to IFRA's work, many materials are still capable of being utilised as part of the palette of more that 3000 materials which perfumers can employ in their creative art. There are restrictions on the use of some substances but these are justified when balanced with the safe enjoyment of fragrances for all. Premium Beauty News - Can you describe us IFRA's self-regulation system ? Stephen Weller - It is important to understand the regulatory context in which all manufacturers of consumer products have to operate, not just the fragrance industry. The Scientific Committee for Consumer Safety (SCCS), the advisory group to the EU Commission, and other EU departments may sometimes receive representations from lobby groups including allergy experts and dermatologists, for instance, suggesting a ban or restriction of fragrance ingredients. When that occurs, IFRA and the Research Institute for Fragrance Materials - RIFM - review the data on the substances, gather views from perfumers and form a group to review the situation. If this review of safety data reveals a positive result then further detailed tests are undertaken to investigate the tipping point and establish the level at which the substance could be safely used by most people whilst also maintaining an adequate olfactory profile. The IFRA Scientific Committee reviews the findings of this research, makes recommendations and issues an IFRA Standard. IFRA recommends the parameters for safe usage. Premium Beauty News - A criticism we sometimes hear, is that IFRA is supporting large chemical manufacturers by banning natural substances. Stephen Weller - What makes IFRA a strong and respected organisation, is the fact that IFRA leads the way by issuing its carefully researched Standards. IFRA Standards, which recommend holding usage to a certain level are not mere guidelines; they are mandatory for IFRA members. The benefits are obvious - for consumers, retailers, manufacturers - right through the supply and usage chain. If an IFRA member develops a perfume, it is deemed safe across Europe and beyond. For global brands this has hugely important and positive implications. It also means that smaller operators and brands can rest assured on the safety of their products with regards to fragrance materials if they follow the Standards. For consumers and health professionals it provides a guarantee that the high safety standards are being adhered to. Finally for perfumers, creative as they are, a restriction shouldn't have a dampening effect but could be expected to spur them into doing what they do best. All perfumers relish a creative challenge and should do so in a safe and assured fashion using materials from a palette of 3000 substances some of which, without the intervention of IFRA, might otherwise have been thrown out - forever. Far from being destroyers of the perfumer's art, IFRA is very much a champion and protector. IFRA helps ensure that this wonderful, creative process can continue to be enjoyed both by the perfumers and by those whose lives are enhanced by the safe enjoyment of fragrances whether these scents are in fine fragrances or everyday household products. Here are some examples of materials that would have risked being banned [1] by the authorities if it were not for IFRA's intervention: – Dimethyl Anthranilate (contained in mandarin oil) – Furfural – Furocoumarins (affecting all citrus oils containing higher levels of furocoumarins) – Lyral – Oakmoss – Tagette (marigold) – Tree moss (as affected as oakmoss) – Verbena absolute – Vetiveryl acetate"
"REACH: costs are soaring, but not the advantages","Despite its complexity (more than 800 pages for the Regulation itself and an extra 12,000 for the explanations), the implementation of the European Regulation on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemical substances. (REACH) was considered has a successful step, according to the Union of Chemical Industries, who tried in Paris on May 29, to draw an initial review of the first five years of application of the text. ""Thanks to a strong mobilization, French chemical manufacturers have adopted REACH"" stresses Jean Pelin, Director General of the UIC, ""but we must remain vigilant to ensure a pragmatic implementation of the regulation is done in order to preserve the competitiveness of our businesses"" he added. The great fear of the French representatives of the chemical industry is indeed the soaring costs associated to REACH. On this point, the Commission estimates were exceeded by a large margin. The latest study available evaluates at EUR 2.1 billion the implementation cost of the first registration deadline, while the cost for all three deadlines had initially been estimated to EUR 2.3 billion. It must be said that the regulation is not only complex, but it has also forced stakeholders to take up many challenges. Upon entry into force of the text, companies had to organize themselves to meet deadlines, in spite of a difficult start on the side the administration. Thus for the pre-registration process in 2008, some of the guidelines were not completed, the Commission having not ruled on some interpretations. As for the first registration phase, once again the deadlines were met, despite the difficulties of setting up the exchange forums (SIEF) and despite the legal and technical complexity of finalizing the registration dossiers. As the various aspects of the regulations unfold, manufacturers must assume new tasks. Since 2011, it is for example, the communication of exposure scenarios in supply chains, or the responses to the ECHA [1] assessments. In addition, the number of companies concerned continues to grow. The next two registration deadlines should concern more SMEs. As for companies downstream in the sector they shall be also concerned. Direct customers, of course, who must in particular provide some feedback on the ""specific uses"" they make of certain substances, but also companies that do not necessarily see themselves as users of chemical substances, who will have to declare the presence of substances of very high concern (known as ""candidate substances"") in finished products, when their concentration exceeds 0.1%. In an industry under severe competitive pressure where prices on high tonnage commodities are dependent of the global market, companies can hardly pass on these extra costs, which therefore impact directly their margins. If for the objective to improve the protection of human health and environment, ""progress is noticeable, in terms of improved knowledge in chemicals used in Europe,"" the UCI emphasises on the fact that REACH also aims to promote the competitiveness of companies. ""On this last point, chemical manufacturers find it difficult today to see the competitive advantages offered by REACH in the medium term,"" worry chemical industry representatives. Even the image of the chemical industry has not been substantially modified by the efforts made by manufacturers. If at the international level, many countries [2] are changing their regulation on chemicals, REACH remains unique today because of its ambitious objectives and broad scope. Thus for example the United States remains strongly opposed to a purely quantitative system based solely on the tonnages of substances. Worse, even within the European Union, the differing interpretations of the public authorities lead to distortion of competition. In such a context, the UCI stresses on the need for a stabilization of the regulatory framework. While the appraisal current conducted by the European Commission could, under the pressure from NGOs, lead to changes in the regulation, the UCI request that no changes are undertaken until all the objectives of REACH, including objective of competitiveness, have not been integrated."

China to approve non-animal cosmetics test,"According to the animal rights organization, scientists funded by its US branch have successfully guided Chinese officials towards the recognition of a first alternative method to animal testing. PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) was concerned that despite many cosmetics companies have pledged to cease any animal testing, they were nevertheless required to perform such tests in order to market their products in China. PETA US thus awarded a grant to scientists at the Institute for In Vitro Sciences (IIVS) late last year, to meet Chinese officials and share their expertise and guidance. According to PETA, the 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake Phototoxicity Assay (3T3 NRU PT), an in vitro toxicological assessment test used to determine the cytotoxicity and photo(cyto)toxicity of chemicals when they come into contact with sunlight, is scheduled to be accepted in China by late summer. This test method was adopted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 2004 and is already in wide use in the US and the European Union. ""Fast, accurate non-animal methods which protect humans better than animal tests are already here, and it's great news that China has responded positively to the scientific arguments supporting them,"" says PETA policy adviser Alistair Currie. Last year, Chinese health authorities had already shown their interest in alternative testing methods through a seminar initiated and organised by the China Cosmetics Research Centre of the Beijing Technology and Business University. On this occasion, members of the cosmetics industry and the scientific community in Europe and the US had shared the expertise and initiate discussions with China on this issue. Beijing's main concern was to fill the gap between Chinese legal requirements and European laws that ban animal testing for cosmetics and their ingredients and have scheduled to prohibit the sale of all cosmetics containing ingredients tested on animals in 2013."
Tax on cosmetics: French trade association claims a first victory,"The FEBEA has obtained from the Council of State, the highest administrative court in France, the recognition of an additional six month delay to undertake the declaration formalities which will serve to calculate the tax amount per company. The Law on the tax passed in December 2011 concerns companies subject to VAT who are placing on the French market for the first time, cosmetic products, after they were manufactured or after they importation. Simply put, manufacturers and importers who market in France finished cosmetic products, but also subcontractors who transfer the ownership of finished cosmetic products - which excludes, the FEBEA believes , ""those who only provide occasionally some services ( contract manufacturing, packaging, conditioning)."" The declarations formalities that must fulfil the concerned companies consist in two main steps: – The declaration with the tax authorities of the tax amount to pay, which is done at the same time as the VAT declaration, on the same document, – The declaration with the ANSM (National Security Agency of Medicines and Health Products, the successor to the AFSSAPS) of the turnover achieved the previous year, i.e., 2011 for this year. Details on the modalities of the declaration with the Agency, that companies were asked to submit no later than March 31, 2012, having only been released on March 23 (8 days only before the time-limit for the filing), the FEBEA initiated proceedings for interim suspension with the Council of State, while negotiating with the Agency so that no penalties would be applied until April 30 in the case of absence of declaration. ""A misdeclaration or an absence of declaration, would have been subject to heavy fines (up to 45,000 euros) - this would have caused irreparable harm to many VSBs-SMEs in our industry,"" explained the Federation. Alain Grangé Cabane, President of the FEBEA, personally pleaded the case of the industry at a hearing on April 24th. Finally, through a summary judgement issued on Monday 30 April, the Council of State officially confirmed the necessity and validity of a further period of six months (until September 30 2012) to enable companies to fulfil their declaration. According to the FEBEA, the granting of this extended deadline will enable ""companies who had not declared yet, to take the necessary time to complete this declaration and hand it out to the Agency, and to those who, feeling they had responded to swiftly under time pressure, to make the necessary corrections."" The granting of this additional time period does not prejudge however, the outcome of other proceedings against the tax undertaken by the representatives of the French cosmetics industry. At the FEBEA officials say they are ""fully mobilized for the future..."""
Three proposals compete to amend U.S. cosmetics legislation,"Following a historical hearing last March before the House Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee on the safety of cosmetic products, there are now three legislative proposals circulating to amend federal rules governing cosmetic products in the United States. The original one (""The Safe Cosmetics Act,"" H.R. 2359) was introduced last year by Representatives Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), Ed Markey (D-MA), and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI). This text targets substances known to have carcinogenic effects and to be toxic for the reproduction. It is supported by the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics, and several other consumer, public health, medical and environmental advocacy groups. At the end of March, Representatives Frank Pallone (D-NJ) and John Dingell (D-MI) introduced the ""Cosmetics Safety Enhancement Act"" (H.R. 4262). Among other proposals, the bill suggests granting recall authority to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Eventually, a third legislative proposal, the ""Cosmetic Safety Amendments Act of 2012,"" H.R. 4395, was introduced by Representative Leonard Lance (R-NJ) and is supported by the professional organisations representing U.S. beauty and personal care companies - namely the Independent Cosmetic Manufacturers and Distributors Association (ICMAD), the International Fragrance Association North America (IFRA), Professional Beauty Association (PBA), Direct Selling Association (DSA), and the Personal Care Products Council (PCPC), all members of the Safe Cosmetics Alliance. ""FDA regulation of cosmetics has protected the public for decades, and this landmark legislation will enhance protections for millions of American consumers,"" said Lezlee Westine, the Council's president and chief executive officer, about the latter bill. ""Cosmetics companies recognize the need for a modern regulatory process that keeps pace with product innovation, as well as the demand for transparency."" Representative Lance's bill calls for increased reporting and transparency by the industry. The legislation aims to create formal processes for the FDA to review ingredients for safety, set safety levels for trace impurities, create national uniformity for cosmetics regulations, review all safety determinations made by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel and establish industry-wide ""Good Manufacturing Practices."" ""We look forward to working with Congressman Lance on this legislation,"" added Westine. ""We also look forward to working on a bipartisan basis with Congressmen Pallone and Dingell on legislation that updates FDA regulation of cosmetics and enhances consumer protections."" Similar comments from ICMAD President and CEO Pam Busiek, who considers ""this bill is a major step forward in increasing transparency at the FDA."" Oppositely, Janet Nudelman from the Breast Cancer Fund, said that ""essential public health protections could be set back another 70 years if industry gets away with writing its own laws that put industry profits over public health."" Nudelman stressed the need for a reform that includes: phasing out cosmetic ingredients linked to cancer, and reproductive or developmental toxicity; a safety standard that protects workers, babies and other vulnerable populations; full disclosure of ingredients and FDA authority to recall dangerous products from the market - all of which are elements of the Safe Cosmetics Act of 2011 (H.R. 2359)."
"""The tax on the cosmetic industry is unconstitutional,"" Alain Grangé-Cabane, FEBEA","The tax on companies that manufacture or import cosmetics and who market them in France was adopted at the end of last year (between Christmas and New Year's Day), to everyone's surprise, and after two unsuccessful attempts in 2009 and 2010. ""A law which was passed on the fly,"" observes Alain Grangé-Cabane for whom, beyond the financial burden for businesses, the ""moral"" damage must not be overlooked, for an industry for whom it is implied that its products require a specially close monitoring. ""Usually when a specific industrial sector is taxed, it is because it is considered a source of nuisance or a danger to health, explains AlainGrangé-Cabane, which is obviously not the case for our industry or its products."" According to Government's estimates, the tax passed last year, with a rate set at 0.1% of the turnover of the concerned companies, should yield between 8 and 10 million euros. Not enough to really relieve the budget of the State, but enough to exasperate an industrial sector, which comprises numerous SMEs, at a time when it must already manage the cost of a transition towards a new regulation. ""Especially since the implementation of this tax is particularly heavy,"" adds Alain Grangé-Cabane. ""Two declarations must be made, one for fiscal purposes, the other for sanitary purposes, with the AFSSAPS [1], for whom companies must disaggregate their turnover into 86 categories, indicating for each of them the number of products sold to the nearest unit. This makes little sense and represents a considerable work load for many companies."" But it is precisely this second declaration that offers the FEBEA the possibility to counterattack, by seizing the newly offered possibility for French people appearing before the courts to challenge the constitutionality of laws which are opposed to them. ""Since the constitutional reform of 23 July 2008, it has indeed become possible to challenge the compliance with the Constitution of a law already in force,"" explained Alain Grangé-Cabane, who is also a former member of the Council of State. According to the new Article 61-1 of the Constitution, this is only possible ""on the occasion of a pending lawsuit before a court."" ""In practice, we only had two options, points out the President of the FEBEA. Either wait until a dispute arises between a cosmetic company and public authorities on this tax and take the opportunity to challenge the law, but this could have taken several years. Or, and that's what we did, challenge before the administrative court the decision of March 22, 2012 taken by the Director of the AFSSAPS determining the model of this declaration to his body and attach to this appeal a Priority Question of Constitutionality (Question Prioritaire de Constitutionnalité - QPC). "" In support of its request, the FEBEA puts two arguments forward. First, the law establishing the tax on the cosmetic industry leads to a breach of equality in relation to public burdens. The funds collected will be in effect, according to the FEBEA, much higher than those really needed by the AFSSAPS to carry out its supervising task of the cosmetics market. In practice therefore, the cosmetic industry would be ""overpaying"" its contributions compared to other industries, which would amount to forcing this industry to finance missions which do not concern her in any way. Second argument, the law also violates the principle of proportionality of penalties. Indeed, it provides in the case of failure to declare to the agency a fine of up to 45,000 euros. ""In an industry in which 20 to 25% of companies have a turnover of less than one million euros, and for which we can estimate an average annual profit of 30,000 euros, it is a totally abusive fine,"" observed Alain Grangé-Cabane. In this case, the Council of State will be the one to determine the admissibility of the QPC raised on March 29 by the French cosmetic industry. The highest administrative court has for that a maximum period of three months to reject the claim or on the contrary forward it to the Constitutional Council for a consideration on its merits, who in turn has a period of three months to issue a decision, which is final and without appeal. On the side of the FEBEA, officials are decidedly confident, the subject has been studied in depth with lawyers and tested with several legal experts. And, after all, the three previous referrals to the Council of State, undertaken under the Presidency of Alain Grangé-Cabane all found a positive conclusion. And things come in fours don't they? Response on September 29, 2012, at the latest."
Cosmetics for children: The Council of Europe recommends more precautions,"Although it has no regulatory authority, the Council of Europe is often a precursor. From its headquarters in Strasbourg, the institution, which comprises 47 member countries, has been the first to define natural cosmetics, to recommend better consumer information on sun protection or to propose the generalization of cosmetovigilance. Inviting States Parties to the Convention on the Elaboration of an European Pharmacopoeia [1], to better protect children under three years against the risks caused by cosmetic products which would be unsuited for them, the Council of Europe echoed the concerns raised by health professionals, particularly in France. On a number of points however, the recommendation of the Council of Europe mostly concerns non EU members and invites them to take over the provisions already included in the new Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 on cosmetic products, in particular on the product safety assessment or the basic requirements for ingredients, or in other texts such as REACH. But the Council of Europe also calls for particular attention to be paid to impurities and traces from raw materials, packaging materials, manufacturing processes, alterations or chemical interactions in the finished product, which should be evaluated, as well as to preservatives, the presence of which should be reduced to ""the minimum effective concentration"". It also urges to pay the greatest attention to the choice of packagings which ""should provide appropriate protection to ensure the physicochemical stability and avoid microbial contamination during storage, distribution and use"" and whose materials ""should be inert and should not release any toxic substances in the product."" If young children have been for the past years the subject of a very special regulatory attention, this is due to important discoveries on their particular sensitivity to certain chemicals, especially concerning endocrine disruptors. Indeed, several organs and vital physiological functions do experience a significant development during childhood, particularly in young children under three years. While recalling these points, the Council of Europe also calls to take into better account the relatively greater exposure of children, not only because of their low weight, but also because of their specific behaviour involving a higher risk of ingestion. Despite its limited scope, both because of the number of states theoretically concerned and because of its non-binding character, this resolution should logically lead to a strengthening of the legislative framework on cosmetics intended for children under three years, a strengthening already well underway in the European Union. Read the text of the Resolution CM/ResAP(2012)1"
How the total ban on animal testing will impact the cosmetics industry?,"This situation comes as a direct result of changes instigated by two separate set of regulation: the European Cosmetics Directive, and in particular its 7th Amendment in 2007, and the regulations concerning the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH). This legislation paved the way for a staggered ban on animal testing, which is due to culminate in the total ban on the sale in Europe of any cosmetics tested on animals, whether it concerns the final products or its ingredients, and wherever in the world the tests have been made. However, as it now clearly appears there will not be enough alternative methods to fully replace animal tests by 2013, it is still unclear, at the moment, as to whether the deadline is feasible. Premium Beauty News asked Dr. Florian Weighardt its insight into some of the most pressing issues faced by the industry in finding suitable and safe alternatives. Premium Beauty News - If the March 2013 deadline is not met, what potential new date will be set? Dr. Florian Weighardt - Any new deadline for the total ban of animal testing will probably be set for a time when all the alternative tests will be available. But nobody really knows. The final word lies in the hands of the legislators, who act on the basis of the scientific opinions they receive from experts. Obviously, politicians will also take into account all the social and economic inputs coming from the industry, consumers and involved NGOs or associations. Premium Beauty News - What will be the most difficult test to find alternatives to? Dr. Florian Weighardt - The most difficult tests to find alternatives for are those which involve complex physiological and metabolic processes, for example toxicokinetics, repeated dose toxicity, skin sensitization, carcinogenicity, and reproductive toxicity. The development of suitable alternatives for these complex tests represents a huge challenge for scientists. These tests all have the scope to assess toxicological aspects of ingredients, which involve the eventual metabolic processing of substances, its eventual accumulation and the effects of chronic exposures over time. None of these aspects can be assessed in a ""simple"" cell culture. Premium Beauty News - Are the cosmetic companies themselves funding the research into alternatives? Dr. Florian Weighardt - Yes, several companies are investing huge amounts into the development and validation of these alternative tests - it has become essential. Animal testing actually requires highly specialised structures and numerous authorities to run effectively, not to mention the many and obvious ethical concerns associated with it. The alternative tests have the advantage of requiring less governmental supervision to operate, whilst also removing the morality issue from the debate. Premium Beauty News - Does the ban have the potential to change the cosmetic industry permanently - for example, will some products cease to become viable and simply not be made any more? Dr. Florian Weighardt - Only time will tell. Theoretically, if an approved set of alternative testing methods is made available, nothing will change. On the other hand the obligations of REACH, combined with the ban of animal testing, will require the unprecedented testing of new and already existing compounds. As a consequence, chemical industries and manufacturers will feel the impact, though we'll have to wait and see how severe this is."
Russia: The new cosmetic regulations will soon come into force,"Premium Beauty News - The adoption by the Customs Union of Technical Regulations applicable to cosmetic products, it's good news for manufacturers? Ramzia Lefebvre - This is great news! With an annual growth rate that could exceed 8% until 2013, the Russian market of cosmetics is one of the most dynamic in the world. For cosmetic manufacturers, the Technical Regulation TR TC 009/2011 [1] has the double advantage of harmonizing the Russian regulation with the regulation in force in the European Union and to abolish the dual system for achieving compliance. Best of all, these technical regulations also include Belarus and Kazakhstan, the two other members of the Customs Union created in 2010. Premium Beauty News - How does this Technical Regulation work exactly? Ramzia Lefebvre - Its aim is to harmonize the requirements on cosmetic products for the member countries of the Customs Union and to get more in line with European rules. This ranges from the manufacturing process to product labelling. Its structure and content are based on both the European Directive 76/768/EEC and the European Regulations 1223/2009 [2]. The definition of cosmetics and the lists of regulated ingredients are almost identical. The text of the Technical Regulations even includes a definition of nanomaterials which is very similar to the one found in the European Regulation and mentions for the first time the term GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice). Similarly, the definition of ""manufacturer"" is complemented by the notion of ""responsible for placing on the market."" There has been quite some progress as you can see! Compared to the current regulation in Russia, this text also has the advantage of grouping all categories of cosmetic products in a single document. However, the harmonization with the current EU rules is not total, particularly with regards to the maintenance of the obligation to establish the product compliance by a third party. Similarly for the labelling of products, the obligation for an expiration date is maintained, and all information must be written in the official language of the member state of the Customs Union in which the product will be marketed. Mastering all these aspects, and anticipating changes and risks in connection with them, are key to the success of export operations. For this purpose, by relying on the services offered by a provider like Intertek who has a dual product and business expertise through its Health & Beauty division and its position as a key player in export certification, exporters are better equipped to face these risks and gain autonomy. Premium Beauty News - And for the placing on the market? Will cosmetic manufacturers benefit from simplified procedures? Ramzia Lefebvre - Yes, certainly. However, prudence is called for because experience has shown us that changes are not always synonymous with simplification, as was the case with the GOST R declaration of conformity in 2010. In practice, from July 2012, only the Declaration of Conformity to the Technical Regulations will be required for most products. Only 13 product categories will continue to be subject to Registration as a single document: artificial tanning products, skin whitening, tattooing, personal hygiene; protection products against harmful manufacturing factors; cosmetics for children; hair dyes and lightening products; hair perms and relaxers; products containing nano-components, depilatory products; peelings; products for dental and oral hygiene containing fluorine (as of a certain percentage of fluorine) teeth whiteners (as of a certain percentage of hydrogen peroxide) Both, the Declaration and the Registration documents will be valid indefinitely and on the whole territory of the Customs Union. Conversely, the conditions needed to obtain the two documents were brought into line with the most demanding conditions, those applying to existing Registrations. To note that products which are certified according to the requirements of the Technical Regulations should bear the EAC conformity mark (for Eurasian Conformity) of the Customs Union, and no longer the Russian Gost-R mark.

Animal testing: The other serial of the season,"This may be the new series of the new year in Europe, just beside the never ending story of the crisis in the euro zone! But in this scenario, the European Commission is under the joint surveillance (but for different reasons) of animal advocates and cosmetics manufacturers. Testing finished cosmetic products on animals has been prohibited in the European Union (EU) since 2004, as with animal testing of ingredients since 2009. In addition to these, after March 2009 there has been a marketing ban on selling cosmetic products within the EU containing ingredients that have been tested on animals after this date, irrespective of the place of testing. However, some very complex tests [1] remain exempted from these various prohibitions until a general marketing ban comes into force in March 2013. While the European Commission recognized it would be impossible to fill the gaps regarding alternative methods to animal testing by the 2013 deadline, the European body said last September not to have the intention to propose postponing the deadline. To break the deadlock, the solution proposed by the Commission exempt from the ban those ingredients ""would bring considerable technical progress and a significant added value to the health and/or wellbeing of consumers/society or to the environment."" In order to benefit of the exemption, concerned ingredients should have to go through a special approval procedure. According to the European Coalition to End Animal Experiments (ECEAE), which revealed the intentions of the Commission, ""this is unacceptable and would still allow cruel animal testing to take place for cosmetics products sold in Europe."" The ECEAE thus decided to mobilise its members and supporters by launching a petition against animal testing. For its part, PETA has enlisted singer Kimberly Wyatt, a former member of the Pussycat Dolls, to appear in a billboard campaign denouncing the ugly side of beauty."
European cosmetics Regulation: a challenge for SMEs,"The entry into force of the European Regulation on cosmetic products [1] in July 2013 has focused much of the discussions of the 9th Congress of the Perfumes and Cosmetics ""Regulatory Issues"" organized by the Cosmetic Valley and Chartres Métropole. Among the 468 people gathered for the occasion, there were many representatives of SMEs, rather unanimous on one point: the term may seem quite far away, but given the importance of the task at hand, time is running out! Admittedly, from REACH to the new Regulation on cosmetic products through the CLP [2] (for Classification, Labelling and Packaging of substances and mixtures) Regulation, the scope of the issues discussed at the Congress was impressive and the stacking of legislations could be bewildering. But ""we must be careful not to pave the way of anti regulation speeches,"" tempers Anne Dux, Director of Scientific and Regulatory Affairs at the Federation of Beauty Enterprises (FEBEA). ""Both REACH and the CLP regulation are quite old already. Moreover, SMEs in our industry hardly have to deal with REACH. They are a bit more concerned by the CLP Regulation, for the protection of their employees. However, their main concern remains the cosmetics regulation, and in our opinion, they are not yet ready,"" she adds. One explanation for the late departure of companies is the fact that several parts of the new regulatory framework have been detailed quite late. But according to Jean-Marc Giroux, president of COSMED, ""all companies will comply with their obligations."" However, the representative of the association of the French cosmetics SMEs, tells the main problem is about resources of time and money to allocate for this purpose. ""We do not deny the interest of the cosmetics Regulations, nor its benefits to consumers and even businesses, but the financial resources to devote to this implementation are very important."" An analysis that shares the FEBEA which calculated that in order to be ready in July 2013, each company must allocate ""the equivalent of a full-time job every 75 formulas"". In any case, in such a context, the French decision to tax its cosmetics industry falls rather bad. Nevertheless, the good organization of the transition period is probably as important as the allocation of resources. ""It is important not to be mistaken in priorities, stresses Anne Dux, we find that firms tend to address the notification first, but it's really the last thing to do."" The priorities are, by decreasing order: – To check that its production complies with the good manufacturing practices, and therefore to audit suppliers, when one do not produce itself, – To organize the cosmeto-vigilance system. ""And that also affects SMEs. To say that one has no problems is not an answer since, as long as one is not well organized to see something, it may never see anything,"" insists the Director of Scientific and Regulatory Affairs of FEBEA. ""We are organising a free and open information session on this subject, on 30 January 2012."" – To check all contracts with partners in order to ensure they comply with the requirements of the Regulation. For contracts with manufacturers, these include provisions relating to good practices. For contracts with distributors, the cosmetic-vigilance clauses are the most important. – Then we can begin the updating of the product information package, knowing that on this issue final guidelines are in draft form and still have to be published by the European Commission. The latter step is probably the one where SMEs may face the greatest difficulties. ""In our view, the main problem for SMEs is that they will be confronted with complex technical issues, including in the toxicological field. They will need advices from experts who will be less and less available, and they will have obtain information that suppliers may be reluctant to provide,"" said Pierre Perrier, co-founder of Essential Consulting. To help companies in this stage, the FEBEA provides a diagnostic service in order to prepare the transition of product information packages. ""We send a person within the company, a specialist who identifies the key issues of each information package,"" adds Anne Dux. For its part, COSMED will launch its Guide of the Schedule 1, in January, a 150-page handbook designed to help businesses get their records in compliance with the new requirements. According to the FEBEA, resources to allocate at this step correspond to the equivalent of one-week full-time job per product information package. Once all these steps completed, and only then, it is possible to make the notification through the web portal set up by the European Commission for this purpose. Notifying a product, is also committing on its comply with the new regulations. The portal set up by the European Commission will be available from January 11, 2012. And between 500,000 and 700,000 notifications are expected by July 2013."
"""The new European Regulation on cosmetics is going to change our way of working!"" Sylvain-Romain Cotte","Premium Beauty News - You are launching a new offer to help cosmetic companies meet their regulatory obligations. Is the new European Regulation going to change the situation at this level? Sylvain-Romain Cotte - The Regulation on cosmetic products [1], which will become mandatory no later than July 11, 2013, will be introducing several new elements, with some of them having a significant impact on the businesses of companies. But mostly, it will clarify some legal points which were ambiguous or interpreted differently from one EU member state to the other. This is the case, in particular, for the notion of person responsible for placing on the market. Articles 4 and 5 of the Regulation give a very precise definition on the marketer's mission and scope of responsibility. They also provide that the person responsible for placing on the market can be a third party specifically appointed by the manufacturer, the customer or the importer. Our analysis is that the entry into force of the Regulation with the removing of many grey areas, will force a number of companies, including distributors, subcontractors and importers of cosmetics to change their way of working. Premium Beauty News - Ensuring the full regulatory compliance of the company's activity and of its products can represent a pretty heavy workload, especially for small businesses. Sylvain-Romain Cotte - Quite true! That's why we are offering three services through a new legal entity that we created, International Beauty Office SAS, with the aim to enable companies to focus on their core business and help them benefit from economies of scale on regulatory issues. First service offer: the role of legal person responsible for placing on the market of products of companies that so wish. In accordance with the requirements of the Regulation, International Beauty Office ensures the full compliance of the cosmetic product vis-à-vis the European regulations and assume responsibility as such. This service is mostly intended for SMEs who do not have the possibility to set up their own regulatory service nor to ensure a constant regulatory watch, as well as for cosmetic brands located in a non-European Union member and whose importer or distributor do not wish to ""endorse"" the responsibility of marketer. Second service offer: the European notification. As of 1 January 2012, companies will be able to electronically start notifying their products to the European Commission and they will need to comply with this requirement no later than July 2013. The marketers will therefore have to organize themselves to perform these procedures internally or rely on qualified service providers. They will have to collect the required data and prioritize the work, by giving priority to products which they are sure will still be on the market after July 2013 and by side-lining the ones they know will no longer be available at that date. In order to meet these confidentiality requirements, it is also a service that we offer to perform in the premises of our customers by despatching one of our staff member trained on a given period of time. Third service offer: the electronic Product Information File (PIF). We build, manage and validate electronically our customers Product Information Files which are required by European regulations. I also remains at the head of SRC Consulting, which still offers a set of consulting & expertise services (regulatory compliance of imported and exported products, compliance audits of industrial sites with Good Manufacturing Practices in cosmetics according to standards EN ISO 22716). Premium Beauty News - You were mentioning economies of scale, how is this achieved concretely? Sylvain-Romain Cotte - The core of our business is regulations, that of our customers is essentially research and development, marketing developments and the placing on the market of cosmetics. For medium-sized companies and/or third country companies who are seeking to market their products in the European Union, it is obviously preferable in terms of regulatory constraints to rely on a specialized service structure rather than internalizing all the costs. We have also invested in the design and development of a unique software package specially intended to perform the computerized management of the cosmetic Product Information File (PIF) which is also available online if necessary on the fully secured website ""DIP-online.com"". It is both an innovative and user-friendly tool based on all our know-how and operational experience. It enables the creation, management, downloading and editing a DIP through a simple process. Of course the storage, archiving and traceability of the technical data are undertaken in a fully secured and confidential manner. Depending on the customers' choice, we can insure the validation of the DIP's technical data or we can offer a complete full service for the DIP with its updating. For the time being, this tool is not intended for the creation of registration files of products exported outside the EU. We have developed this expert tool on European regulatory requirements. It is therefore particularly suited to the needs of operators within the European market. In addition, we are developing partnerships on DIP Online and we are already working with other providers to offer a comprehensive range of quality services. We plan to present our company and DIP Online in Paris early next year. Premium Beauty News - Doesn't the involvement of third parties like your new company, raise confidentiality issues? Sylvain-Romain Cotte - On the contrary, it often helps to solve them! I am convinced our action will be likely to facilitate the relationship between contractors and subcontractors. We all know that customers, who need to obtain all the guarantees in terms of regulatory compliance sometimes find it difficult to collect all the legal technical information they want from their suppliers or subcontractors. The latter being legitimately concerned with preserving the confidentiality of some key information. In this context, the involvement of a third party, such as International Beauty Office SAS, which will guarantee the regulatory compliance, is likely to reassure all parties. In addition DIP-Online, our software package, makes it possible if need be, to filter in a completely transparent manner the editing of some of the DIP's details, and this, with the contractual consent of the parties involved (client and subcontractors). Our company remaining the guarantor that all the legal information has been provided. At their request, the supervisory authorities have of course access to all the data contained in the DIP."
French health agency asks for lower aluminium concentration in cosmetics,"""More than twenty-five aluminium compounds can be used in cosmetic products,"" explains the French Agency in a recent safety assessment of the risks linked to the use of aluminium in cosmetic products. ""The aluminium chlorohydrate is one of the most widely used, especially as antitranspirant,"" the agency adds. Since the beginning of the 2000s, several studies have been focusing on the risks related to these substances, in particular because of the role of aluminium in the Alzheimer's disease. Since 2004 and the publication of the works of Darbre et al. (2003), the possible link between the use of underarm cosmetics such as aluminum-based antiperspirants and breast cancer made the headlines. So far, previous attempts to assess the risk related to aluminium in cosmetic products collided with the lack of relevant data, and the latest assessment by the French agency was made possible thanks to a recent dermal absorption study provided by the cosmetics industry. This in vitro study conducted on human skin allowed to estimate the quantities of aluminium absorbed via a daily exposure to an antiperspirant containing 20% of aluminum chlorohydrate (2.5% aluminum) to a rate of 0.5% in case of the exposure of intact skin, and to a rate of 18% in the case of damaged skin exposure. The margin of safety is 20 in intact skin exposure conditions and less than 1 in the case of damaged skin exposure conditions, the Afssaps says. Under such circumstances, what are the possible effects of exposure to aluminium? Repeated dose administration in laboratory animals showed that several aluminium containing compounds have the potential to produce neurotoxicity and to affect the male reproductive system. Human effects (neurotoxicity, anemia…) are also known in patients undergoing dialysis and thereby chronically exposed parenterally to high concentrations of aluminium, as well as in premature infants fed by parenteral route. However, the animal studies did not show any carcinogenic potential. Furthermore, epidemiological data ""do not establish any conclusive link between dermal aluminum exposure and development of cancer,"" says the agency. Thus the Afssaps deems that ""exposure to antiperspirant products with concentrations of 20% aluminium chlorohydrate does not ensure consumer safety under normal conditions of use."" In conclusion, the Afssaps recommends: – to restrict the concentration of aluminum in cosmetic products at 0.6%; – not to use cosmetics containing aluminum on damaged skin (after shaving or if the consumer's skin is affected by small cuts), and to clearly indicate this information on the packaging. Concerning cosmetics others than antiperspirants, the Afssaps underlines that regulations could become more stringent, as its risk assessment does not take into account the total exposure to various products likely to contain aluminium."
Parabens: EU cosmetics rules to be amended,"The strengthening of restrictions on the use of parabens had already been announced by the European Commission to take into account the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) recommending limiting the use of butylparaben and propylparaben at a maximum concentration of 0.19%. The SCCS had also confirmed the safety of methyl paraben and ethyl paraben at current maximum allowable concentrations (0.4%). [1] The draft, however, should be partially revised to incorporate recent information provided by the SCCS about the safety of parabens in cosmetic products intended for children under three years of age. [2] According to information collected by Premium Beauty News, the Commission should propose to Member States representatives: – To prohibit the isopropyl, isobutyl, pentyl, phenyl and benzyl parabens and their salts in all cosmetic products. These substances, are considered as having only very little commercial interest, and the industry had given up supporting them. – To maintain the maximum allowable concentration of methyl and ethyl parabens and their salts at 0.4% (acid) for an ester, in all cosmetic products. – To lower the concentration of use of propyl and butyl parabens and salts to 0.19% (ester) alone or together, and to prohibit their use in leave-on cosmetic products intended to be applied the nappy area of children under six months. – To maintain at 0.8% (acid) the maximum allowable concentration of use in all cosmetic products for mixtures of authorised esters (methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl). The Commission therefore intends to strictly follow the recommendations of scientists and opts for the utmost care regarding leave-on cosmetics applied the nappy area of children under six months, the only case for which the SCCS had indicated that risk could not be excluded totally. The draft should be discussed on the 8th and 9th of November 2011. Taking into account the time required for consultation, the final version should be adopted and published in the Official Journal of the European Union during the first quarter of 2012. Once the new rules published, manufacturers will have to put their products in compliance within 6 to 12 months."
The European Commission defines nanomaterials,"The definition adopted by the Commission is based on the size of the constituent particles of a material. The wording describes a nanomaterial as ""a natural, incidental or manufactured material containing particles, in an unbound state or as an aggregate or as an agglomerate and where, for 50% or more of the particles in the number size distribution, one or more external dimensions is in the size range 1 nm - 100 nm."" According to the European Commission, a clear definition was needed to ensure that the appropriate chemical safety rules apply. ""I am happy to say that the EU is the first to come forward with a cross-cutting designation of nanomaterials to be used for all regulatory purposes. We have come up with a solid definition based on scientific input and a broad consultation. Industry needs a clear coherent regulatory framework in this important economic sector, and consumers deserve accurate information about these substances. It is an important step towards addressing any possible risks for the environment and human health, while ensuring that this new technology can live up to its potential,"" commented European Environment Commissioner Janez Potočnik. A draft version of the definition was subject to a public consultation, and the Commission says the definition is based on scientific advice from the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) and the Joint Research Centre (JRC). However, while the SCENHIR suggested to classify as nanomaterial any substance containing at least 0.15% of nanoparticles, eventually put the threshold at 50%. BEUC, the European Consumer's Organisation, as well as the European Environmental Bureau (EEB), said they were disappointed and surprised by the shift of threshold from 0.15% to 50%, which they consider will exclude too many substances from the scope of the definition. The Commission said the decision to deviate from this threshold value was made for practical considerations. ""Nanoparticles are present in low quantities in most solid materials. The percentage may be significant, in particular in certain powders. Therefore, a threshold of 0.15% could include too broad a range of materials within the definition, and would have made it difficult to tailor regulatory provisions appropriately. The choice of 50 % is based on the attempt to distinguish nanomaterials which may exhibit specific novel properties from conventional chemical substances."" As far as the chemicals industry is concerned, Cefic deems on the contrary that the definition is too broad in scope and therefore difficult to integrate into existing legislation in a meaningful way Regarding cosmetics, the new Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 of 30 November 2009 on cosmetic products already provides a definition of nanomaterials [1], which significantly differs from the one the Commission just adopted. In practice, earlier definitions, developed on a case-by-case basis and which vary across sectors, will nevertheless remain applicable in their respective areas, as long as these texts will not be updated by the legislator. However, the Commission may decide to propose some legal updates where deemed necessary, this should be the case in particular for REACH. Otherwise, the Commission intends to use the definition in new proposals and applied it in a flexible way. For instance, in case of specific concerns related to the environment, health, safety or competitiveness, a lower threshold for the number size distribution of nanoparticles may be used. The definition will be reviewed in 2014 in the light of technical and scientific progress."
Parabens and children: no health risk according to the SCCS,"The Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS), who is in charge of advising the European Commission on scientific matters, further addressed the issue on the safety of parabens in cosmetic products, focusing this time on the specific case of products intended for young children. In a previous opinion [1], the Committee had indeed confirmed the safety of the two commonly used parabens (methyl paraben and ethyl paraben) within the limits of recommended concentrations (0.4%) and lowered to 0.19% the concentration use of butylparaben and propylparaben. If this decision had the effect of rather reassuring the industry, whose practices were already consistent with the Committee's recommendations, the latter was criticized for not specifically addressing the case of children under three, considered more sensitive to risks linked to hormonal disruptors. Soon after, the Danish authorities invoked the safeguard clause, arguing that butylparaben and propylparaben were to be banned in cosmetics for children under three years, a ban in force in the country since March 15. The activation of the safeguard clause by a Member State of the European Union automatically resulting in the referral of the Commission, the latter asked the CSSC to clarify its opinion in the light of the objections raised by Denmark. In its opinion of 10 October (CSSC/1446/11), the Committee therefore recalls that its previous risk analysis of parabens was based on particularly conservative assumptions including concerning the actual exposure to parabens, and that the data now available seems to confirm that the reality of the exposure in Europe and in the United States is actually far less than the one imagined at the time. Given the safety margins adopted, the SCCS believes that parabens are not a safety issue, and this regardless of the age of users. However the Committee noted, that in the case of leave-on products intended for application in the nappy area of children under 6 months, a risk could not be excluded, because of the risk of skin lesions in this area and because of the immaturity of the immune system at this age. However, such concerns should only arise, the Committee said, in the case the worst level of exposure is retained. Unfortunately, the Committee indicated that the currently available scientific data did permit the Committee to further refine its position on the subject. Details provided by the SCCS strongly weaken the position of the Danish authorities, but do not provide answers to all questions. So it is now up to the Commission to decide."
On-line resale of trade-marked products: further details from the Court of Justice of the European Union,"Lessons drawn from this decision will encourage online marketplaces like eBay, to act with the utmost caution particularly on the following cases: – the online sales of demonstration samples and of unboxed products (from which the outer packaging has been removed); – the reservation from platforms like eBay, of keyword comprising trade marks. Having found that a series of its trade marked products were offered for sale on eBay, some of them without their packaging and the other ones, demonstration samples not intended for sale, the L'Oréal company assigned before the English courts (High Court of Justice) the individuals responsible for these sales, as well as the various companies from the eBay group, alleging an infringement of its trade mark rights. L'Oréal accused them of having sold some testers not intended for sale, as well as unboxed products, and was also complaining that eBay had rent to Google several keywords (AdWords) consisting of trade marks owned by L'Oréal, among which Shu Uemura and Matrix Hair. Thus, internet users entering these trade marks into the Google search engine could see displayed commercial links pointing to the eBay site and, more specifically, to advertisements on these trade marked products offered for sale on the website. eBay and individuals defendants, for their part, put forward the theory of exhaustion of rights according to which the owner of a trade mark cannot prohibit the use of it for products that have already been marketed with his consent within the European Union: in giving his approval, he has exhausted his rights, except for a ""legitimate reason"", which in practice equals to the marketing of products under a altered form (repackaging not taking into account the requirements of the manufacturer, or otherwise infringing the brand image because of its poor quality...). eBay also denied any wrongdoing by renting as AdWords several of L'Oréal's trade marks, in that, such use did not affect the essential function of the trade mark which is to guarantee the origin of products, since these keywords did actually refer to some products from the L'Oréal brand offered for sale on the eBay platform. Believing that the case required guidance from the CJEU, the High Court of Justice sought advice from the former with a series of questions that can be summarized in the following (and non exhaustive) way: – Can the product samples available from L'Oréal's authorized distributors be considered as ""marketed"" and therefore can they be sold freely on the eBay website without L'Oréal being able to object to it? – Can the removal of the outer packaging of some of the cosmetic products be considered as a ""legitimate reason"" justifying a refusal from L'Oréal and thus hindering the free reselling of products? – Can the fact that eBay reserved on Google some keywords containing some trade marks owned by L'Oréal be considered as an illegal use of these trade marks? – Can the service provided by a sales platform like eBay be qualified has a hosting service, to which is attached a system of limited liability? On the first point, the CJEU's answer is a traditional one: it considers that ""the supply by L'Oréal to its authorized distributors of demonstration samples bearing its mark is not, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, a proof of placing on the market"" thus rejecting the exhaustion of rights theory and giving L'Oréal the possibility to oppose to their resale. In a previous ruling of June 3rd, 2010 (Case C-127/09) the CJEU had adopted a similar position about testers distributed by the Coty Group, in Germany. On the second point, the response of the CJEU was quite clear in stating that the unboxing of a product is not in itself unlawful ""but that it becomes unlawful when the consequences are that vital information, such as the identification of the manufacturer or the name of the person responsible for the marketing of the cosmetic product are no longer available"". The solution adopted here by the CJEU seems more flexible for the sale of a repacked product, for which compliance with the following four conditions had been set in a decision of the Court on 11 July 1996 (Case C-427/93, C-429/93 and C-436/96): – repackaging should be ""necessary"" to market the product in the importing Member State, for example under a national rule requiring a certain type or size of packaging; – the product's state of origin should not be altered; – the name of the entity who repacked the product must be clearly indicated on the new packaging; – the trade mark proprietor must have received notice before the repacked product is offered for sale. On the third point, the Court recalls here the principles established in its Google Judgement of March 23, 2010 (Cases C-236/08 to C-238/08), namely: – the reservation of keywords corresponding to trade marks enabling the display of a sponsored link leading only to the eBay site (home page) does not constitute, for the latter, a reprehensible use in the domain of trade mark laws because the service provided by eBay is not identical or even similar to the activity of L'Oréal; – on the contrary, when these same keywords lead to the display of a link pointing directly to products offered for sale placed on the eBay platform, the use of the trade mark is then characterized; the Court stating that the fact according to which the products sold are proposed by internet users using the eBay site, and not by eBay itself has no effect and that the latter is indeed making ""use"" of these trade marks; – finally, this practice is illegal if it is ""likely to undermine one of the functions of the mark"", an infringement that exists ""when advertising does not enable or makes it difficult for reasonably well-informed and observant internet users to ascertain whether the goods concerned originate from the proprietor of the trade mark or from a linked business or, on the contrary, originate from a third party"" in this case, the Court did not rule on the fact whether the trade links pointed to announcements posted on the eBay site and concerning the products in question, generated or not the afore mentioned confusion. Finally, and on the fourth point, the CJEU considers that a platform like eBay should benefit from the system of limited liability applicable to a hosting site provided it does not play an ""active part"" giving it ""a knowledge or a control of stored data"", a condition which is left to the appreciation of national courts. The Court notes, however - and this is perhaps not neutral - that eBay ""performs a processing of the data which it has stored at the request of its customer advertisers"" and that it ""also provides assistance such as optimising the presentation or promoting some of the online offers""... It is on this last point that online marketplaces will have be the most careful in order to avoid, like Google, moving away from the classification of hosting site and to the system of limited liability which is attached to it. The balance of electronic commerce, on which much of modern economy now depends, is in the hands of national judges... surely a topic to be followed very closely."
Australia: Notification and assessment of cosmetic ingredients simplified,"So far in Australia, the regulation of ingredients used in cosmetic products has been split between the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and the National Industrial Chemicals Scheme (NICNAS). Such a situation ""has been confusing for consumers and a burden on industry,"" said Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing, Catherine King, welcoming the vote of the law changing the requirements applicable to the notification and assessment of industrial chemicals. ""The new legislation will cut red tape, eliminate overlapping regulation between agencies and better protect public health,"" she added. In practice, the vote of The Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Amendment (Inventory) Bill 2011, means that the TGA will transfer the monitoring of ingredients used in cosmetic products, in particular ultraviolet filters, onto the Australian Inventory of Chemical Substances (AICS). ""For industry this new law will mean that the ingredients in their products will automatically be included in the Australian Inventory of Chemical Substances (AICS) without requiring further assessment by NICNAS,"" explained Catherine King. ""The passing of the new laws completes the government's cosmetics regulatory reforms which we began in 2007."" A consequence of the new law is also that all the information regarding substances used in cosmetic products will now be available from NICNAS, in particular trough its website. According to Ms King, consumers now can ""find information in one place about the regulation of cosmetic ingredients, including the assessment of ultra-violet filters in secondary sunscreen products, which are one group of the cosmetic ingredients transferred to NICNAS under the cosmetic reforms."" The new law also removes the need for NICNAS to prepare and publish a summary report for each chemical assessment as NICNAS now publishes the full public report for each assessment on the NICNAS website."
Animal testing: the Commission intends to maintain the 2013 deadline,"The European Commission officially recognized on Thursday, September 13th, it would be impossible to fill the gaps regarding alternative methods to animal testing by the 2013 deadline. However, the Commission added not to have the intention to propose postponing the deadline. ""Instead, the Commission is currently assessing the impact of the entry into force of the ban in 2013 without alternatives and will decide on next steps on the basis of the full impact assessment,"" the European institution said in release. Testing finished cosmetic products on animals has been prohibited in the European Union (EU) since 2004, as with animal testing of ingredients since 2009. In addition to these, after March 2009 there has been a marketing ban on selling cosmetic products within the EU containing ingredients that have been tested on animals after this date, irrespective of the place of testing. However, some very complex tests [1] remain exempted from these various prohibitions until a general marketing ban comes into force in March 2013. It is precisely for these tests that solutions for replacing animals will be missing by the deadline. In the report presented to the European Parliament and Council, the Commission highlights the continued commitment in Europe to find alternative approaches. ""Over the last 20 years more than 200 million euros has been dedicated to research in this area in the EU and the commitment to finding alternatives to animal testing continues both in Europe and worldwide, said John Dalli, Heath and Consumer Commissioner. This research and development has not only reduced the number of animals used in testing, it is at the same time yielding important results in terms of better science to the benefit of consumer safety."" Validated alternative methods are now available for the identification of corrosive substances, skin irritants and severe eye irritants, skin phototoxicity and skin penetration as well as to assess genotoxicity. Furthermore, significant advances have been made in many other areas. The Commission says that research efforts regarding alternative testing on animals will be carried on, both at the European level, in partnership with the industry, and at the international level, in particular in cooperation with the USA, Japan and Canada. The European Commission, which is currently assessing the environmental, animal welfare, economic and social impacts of the implementation of the full marketing ban scheduled for 2013, will announce its final decision by the end of 2011. The Commission says that, while full replacement is not possible by 2013, ""there is potential for partial replacement strategies and developing a 'toolbox' of test methods to be improved until the goal can be reached."" For its part, Colipa, the association representing the European cosmetics industry, welcomed the Commission's report, considering it highlights the progress achieved and the efforts of the industry to put a final end to all animal tests. Regarding the next steps, Bertil Heerink, Colipa's Director General, said to be ready to provide the Commission with ""any further input required"" for the forthcoming impact assessment and the development of partial replacement strategies."
France bans 3-benzylidene-camphor in cosmetics,"The 3-benzylidene-camphor (CAS: 15087-24-8), which has been banned in France, is a substance that, in practice, is scarcely used by cosmetics makers. However, it can be found in some products, in particular in sun protection creams. Indeed, the European regulation has bee allowing its use so far, in particular as a UV filter at a maximum concentration of 2 %. In a decision dated August 24, 2011, the French Agency for Safety of Health Products (AFSSAPS) says that this substance is likely to cause endocrine disruption and particularly to affect fertility. According the AFSSAPS, many recent studies, conducted both in vitro and in vivo demonstrate these effects, ""especially given the positive results achieved during in vitro estrogenic tests and an uterotrophic assay in female rats (increased weight of the uterus) as well as changes observed in reproductive organs in a reproductive toxicity study."" In addition, the Agency points out two skin absorption studies that were part of the file upon which this substance was authorized as a UV filter. According to the authority responsible for ensuring the safety of cosmetic products sold in France, these studies were affected by methodological flaws: ""on the one hand, an exposure of volunteer limited to six hours can not be considered as a foreseeable duration of use and, on the other hand, the dermal absorption rate was calculated from the average of the two rates obtained from these studies, while it the highest value that must be considered in order to assess the risk on the base of maximum exposure."" Considering that 3-Benzylidene-camphor can present ""a serious danger to human health"", Afssaps has decided to prohibit its use in cosmetic products manufactured, imported or distributed in France. Concerned manufacturers and importers are asked to take, without delay, all necessary measures in order to stop the distribution of products that contain this substance. This measure, said the agency, was adopted pending a decision of the European Commission. Should the Commission consider that the decision of French authorities is scientifically substantiated, the ban would be extended in Europe. The endocrine disruptors issue is highly sensitive in France where a majority of MPs voted on the 3rd of May to ban them from consumer products. For additional information, read the AFSSAP's decision here below or on the Agency's website (in French): Or the text as it was published on September 17, 2011 in the Official Journal (Update September 19, 2011):"
British advertising watchdog bans two digitally retouched ads,"It is the first decision of this kind after the British bodies regulating advertising practices have published a new advertising guidance that aimed to bring greater clarity about digital retouching for the cosmetics sector. The prohibition follows a complaint by Liberal Democrat MP Jo Swinson that the ads were misleading, because of digital alterations and concerns a two-page magazine ad for the Teint Miracle foundation by Lancôme, featuring an image of actress Julia Roberts, and a magazine ad for The Eraser foundation by Maybelline, featuring an image of top-model Christy Turlington. In both cases, L'Oréal admitted to the ASA that ""post-production techniques"" had been used, but claimed the images accurately illustrated the results the products could achieve. The cosmetics firm provided details on how the photographs were digitally retouched. In the Lancôme case L'Oréal even provided before and after laboratory pictures of testers wearing the foundation. Nevertheless, the ASA deemed that the information provided by the company did not enabled it to conclude that the ad images accurately illustrated what effect the products were capable to achieve. By prohibiting the ads from further appearance, the British watchdog implied the digital postproduction techniques used might have exaggerated the results of the products. A few months ago the Committee of Advertising Practice (CAP) and the Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice (BCAP) issued a Help Note on 'The use of production techniques in cosmetics advertising'. This document is supposed to clarify under which circumstances pre and post production techniques are admissible, or not, in cosmetic ads. The Help Note gives examples of production techniques that, depending on their use, are likely to mislead and those that are not. The text allows ""minor adjustments to correct for lighting problems and other photographic issues."" Apparently the ASA has opted for a stringent interpretation of the document."
Endocrine disrupters: the French Parliament reaffirms the precautionary principle,"It is not a very well known organization, but it plays a key role when issues of both scientific and political sensitivity are submitted to the Parliament. Composed of 18 deputies and 18 senators, the Parliamentary Office for the Evaluation of Scientific and Technological Choices (OPECST) aims to take stock of up-to-date knowledge in order to inform the French Parliament. It enjoys the support of a scientific council featuring 24 internationally renowned experts. As part of on-going debates in France relating to endocrine disruptors, in approving the report submitted by Senator Gilbert Barbier, entitled ""Endocrine disruptors, the time for caution"", the OPECST recently brought grist to the mill of those supporting stricter regulations for these substances. Concerns about endocrine disrupters find their origin in a significant, and not yet explained, increase in hormone-related diseases like some cancers and fertility problems, said the French senator. In France, the occurrence of breast cancer has doubled since 1980. It would be the same for testicular cancer in developed countries since 1970. Concerning fertility, researchers are concerned about a possible combination between the decrease by 50% of the sperm count and the increased occurrence of male genital malformations. The report stresses that scientific data already available establish a credible causal link between these diseases and the action of endocrine disrupting substances. However, there are still many uncertainties about particular mechanisms of action at low doses, in combination, or at specific times of life and about the different molecules involved. Despite these uncertainties, Senator Gilbert Barbier deems that the available data are sufficient to act now. He therefore proposed a series of actions to protect the most vulnerable populations, particularly babies and pregnant women, starting with a strengthening of research efforts with the aim to validate international tests allowing the detection of endocrine disrupters by 2013. Howevern Senator Barbier mainly requires better information of consumers and advocates using dedicated signs to clearly warn pregnant and lactating women they should avoid to expose themselves and their young children to products containing endocrine disruptors. The necessity to label this logo would be submitted to the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES). Eventually, since the time of exposure may be greater than the dose, the report reaffirms the goal to ban, at a European-wide level, the presence of endocrine disruptors in products specifically designed for pregnant and lactating women and young children. On the 3rd May, the French National Assembly voted in first reading, a proposition of law prohibiting the use of three types of endocrine disruptors: parabens, phthalates and alkylphenols. At the moment, the text is still in the hands of senators, waiting for a second reading. If it states the risks linked to endocrine disruptors with no ambiguity, the OPECST report, which is merely informative, considers a possible ban on endocrine disruptors only in products intended for certain categories and recommends that to be done at European level, with no fixed deadline, and without laying down in details what substances would be involved."
US industry criticizes bill to reform cosmetics legislation,"According to its sponsors, Reps. Jan Schakowsky, Ed Markey, and Tammy Baldwin, the Safe Cosmetics Act of 2011 (H.R. 2359), which was introduced at the end of June in the House of Representatives, aims to ""close major loopholes in federal law that allow companies to use ingredient in cosmetics and personal care products known to damage human health and the environment."" Key provisions in the bill include: random post marketing tests, registration of cosmetic companies with FDA and payment of corresponding fees, a list of prohibited ingredients, mandatory reporting of adverse health effects, increased power for the FDA, including the possibility to recall products. The bill is a partially rewritten version of the previous attempt that was introduced last year. ""Industry self-regulation just isn't working. This bill recognizes that consumers have a right to safe personal care products and that companies have a responsibility to ensure their products are safe,"" said Lisa Archer, director of the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics, an advocacy group campaigning against hazardous chemicals in cosmetics. ""We agree with Reps. Schakowsky, Markey and Baldwin about the need for certain provisions of the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to be modernized in order to keep pace with evolving science and the growth of our industry,"" commented Lezlee Westine, President and CEO of thePersonal Care Products Council (PCPC), the leading trade association representing US manufacturers and marketers of cosmetic and personal care products. However, ""we are very concerned that, as written, it contains provisions that will place unnecessary burdens on FDA and businesses of all sizes and may compromise jobs without providing meaningful benefits to consumers,"" she added. Personal Care Truth, a group of independent cosmetic business owners, also responded to the proposed act to address what it believes to be misinformation included in the bill. The group said the bill holds universal flaws that could impact the entire cosmetics industry, including large and small businesses. ""It is unworkable, far reaching, and will do absolutely nothing to make cosmetics safer than they already are,"" said Lisa Rodgers, co-founder of Personal Care Truth. More particularly,Personal Care Truth criticizes the risk of label confusion as the process of labelling all components and contaminants of each ingredient would be nearly impossible, registration duplication for the manufacturer and distributor, and the inappropriate definition of adverse health effects."
"New cosmetics regulations, what is the impact on the industry's everyday business?","Premium Beauty News - What is the current situation and what are the immediate consequences? Bernard Brancq - All cosmetic products are formulated with ingredients, whether natural or not, comprising chemicals. Even though the marketing trend in favour of ""green"" products suggests they are safe, it is still necessary to prove their perfect safety for consumer use according to comprehensive specifications that take into account all routes of exposure. Some surprises are possible for many ingredients, natural or not, who, although they are used in small quantities do not have a comprehensive safety record. For more widely used substances, under REACH it will soon be possible to know if they are all allowed. As such, it is necessary to wait for results based on the regulatory process and to not put suspicion on some ingredients, in view of non-scientifically based data, or even ban them by ignoring existing regulations. In this regard, the case of parabens, authorized by the Cosmetic Regulations [1] and recently reviewed by the SCCS (Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety) is instructive Premium Beauty News - There may also have some collateral consequences! Bernard Brancq - That's true, as these regulations generate high costs for testing and a strong mobilization of R&D means of companies in the cosmetics industry to the detriment of innovation which is, as you know, both the growth engine of the profession and its weight in the economy. Obviously the cost of ingredients will be on the rise too. The number of safe available ingredients will be reduced, requiring the reformulation of many cosmetic products. Finally, we can expect the sector to operate some relocations of its R&D and production in emerging countries where cosmetic products will be marketed in priority before Europe and where animal testing is still allowed. Thus, economic and social consequences which are not insignificant, even if the regulations of these countries copy quite quickly the ones in Europe. On the other hand, we must admit that consumers safety will be improved, thereby strengthening their confidence and trust in beauty products, while the image of the profession will be reinforced at the same time."
FDA issues new sunscreen rules,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has posted long awaited regulations regarding over-the-counter (OTC) sunscreen products. The updated rules provide new labelling requirements as well compulsory testing for effectiveness by extending compulsory testing to the measure of ultraviolet A (UVA) protection. Under the current regulation, manufacturers were only required to test for ultraviolet B rays (UVB) that are the major cause of sunburn. The final regulation allows sunscreen products that pass the FDA's test for protection against both UVA and UVB rays to be labelled as ""Broad Spectrum."" Furthermore, as both UVB and UVA radiation contribute to sunburn, skin cancer, and premature skin aging, while sunburn is primarily caused by UVB radiation, sunscreens labelled as both Broad Spectrum and SPF 15 (or higher), if used regularly, as directed, and in combination with other sun protection measures can claim they ""help prevent sunburn, reduce the risk of skin cancer, and reduce the risk of early skin aging."" Any product that is not ""Broad Spectrum"", or that is ""Broad Spectrum"" but has an SPF between 2 to 14, will be required to have a warning stating that it has not been shown to help prevent skin cancer or early skin aging. The FDA clear wants to push these products out of the market. The new regulations will become effective for most manufacturers in one year. However, manufacturers with annual sales less than USD 25,000 have two years to comply. ""We are concerned about manufacturers' ability to make the required testing and labelling changes in only 12 months given the thousands of products on the market, the limited number of testing facilities, and the time needed to redesign product labelling. It is unusual for FDA to require such a short implementation period for a rule making of this scope. Manufacturers typically require at least two years to design and implement broad-scale, product-wide labelling changes,"" said Farah Ahmed, Chair of the Personal Care Products Council Sunscreen Task Force, in a statement. In addition to the final rule for sunscreen labelling, the FDA also released a Proposed Rule that would limit the maximum SPF value on sunscreen labels to ""50+"". According to the FDA, there is not sufficient data to show that products with SPF values higher than 50 provide greater protection for users than products with SPF values of 50. However, the proposal creates the opportunity for the submission of data to support including higher SPF values in the final rule. FDA looks forward to receiving stakeholders' comments on this document. Major companies, such as Johnson & Johnson or Energizer, have already said they would oppose this proposal and that data is available to support the usefulness of sunscreen with SPF higher than 50. ""In its Proposed Rule, FDA acknowledged that SPFs higher than 50 have been substantiated by independent clinical testing labs, and the results are validated and repeatable. We look forward to working further with the agency on this issue. Individual companies may also provide their own additional data supporting SPFs higher than 50,"" added Farah Ahmed. In an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) for Dosage Forms, the FDA announced its intention to investigate several issues regarding dosage forms for sunscreens, in particular the safety of sunscreen sprays. The federal agency said the ANPR will allow the public a period of time to submit requested data addressing the effectiveness and the safety of sunscreen sprays and to comment on possible directions and warnings for sprays that the FDA may pursue in the future, among other issues!"
Parabens: the debate continues in France,"While it is still not included in the agenda of the Senate, the bill proposed by Yvan Lachaud (an MP from the 'Nouveau Centre' party, centre right), adopted on first reading by the National Assembly with the aim to ban the use of phthalates, parabens and alkylphenols in consumer goods, continues to cause some turmoil in France and Europe. If, after the vote, the UIC (Union of Chemical Industries) expressed its feeling of ""utter incomprehension"", and the industry of plasticizers, represented by the ECPI (European Council for Plasticizers and Intermediates), was pinpointing at a proposal ""scientifically unjustified and unenforceable in practice"" and which was offering ""more drawbacks than solutions"", representatives from the cosmetics industry were for their part, much more cautious in their reactions. Thus, to date, the FEBEA (the French trade association representing manufacturers specialised in beauty products) expressed no opinion whatsoever on the subject, merely relaying on the site ParlonsCosmetiques.com an interview with Marc Mortureux, the Director General of the Anses [1] stressing on the fact that ""the levels of exposure to these substances and the risks they may pose are highly contrasted"". The discretion was the same at the Colipa, the European cosmetics association, which issued no general statement on the subject. ""All ingredients, including parabens, are screened by top experts. The use levels recommended by the SCCS (the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety) in their latest Opinion on the safety of parabens in cosmetic products [2], reflect to a great extent current use practice in cosmetic products on the EU market,"" Bertil Heerink, Colipa Director-General, told Premium Beauty News. The organization, which represents manufacturers with the European authorities, however, alerted the Commission via the Directorate General for Health and Consumers, on the incompatibility of the proposed Lachaud bill with European regulations. But it's probably through the stand taken by the COSMED, the association of French SMEs in the cosmetics industry, that the embarrassment of this industry seemed the most visible. In a lengthy statement published on its website, the COSMED expressed its concerns about a proposed bill that would cause ""an immediate detriment to the cosmetics industry"", but also believed that it ""could also be regarded as visionary"". In fact, the association took note of consumers doubts and believed that scientific expertise alone would not be sufficient to alleviate them. ""in spite of its flaws and even in the case of its possible withdrawal, this proposed bill will clearly play a role in accelerating the finding of alternative solutions acceptable to all, as well as by launching the necessary dialogue to be engaged with consumers"". Eventually, COSMED asked for time: the association called for the rejection of the proposed bill while announcing ""a total or partial abandonment of parabens by the trade itself provided alternative solutions were made available on the market"". Indeed, the abandonment of parabens would represent a considerable and yet probably impossible effort to achieve for most brands. COSMED thus noted that the relative success encountered with paraben-free cosmetic lines most often resulted from products which were designed with this in mind, and more rarely through the reformulation of existing lines. In its edition dated May 24, 2011, the French newspaper, Le Monde reported having identified about 400 medicines containing parabens and published a list of them on its website lemonde.fr. The list includes all sorts of products, such as creams like Biafine; many cough syrups (Clarix, Codotussyl, Drill, Hexapneumine, Humex, Pectosan, Rhinathiol); gastrointestinal protectants (Maalox, Gaviscon); treatment for intestinal transit disorders (Motilium) or against nausea and vomiting (Primpéran); oral suspension forms of cardiovascular medicines (Cozaar, Vastarel) or of antibiotics (Josacine, Zinnat); medicines against pain and fever (generic forms of ibuprofène and paracétamol) treatment against asthenia (Sargenor). Is this extension of the debate, beyond the cosmetics industry, likely to change its nature? It is possible because medicines do not share the same status as cosmetics, in the minds of consumers not to mention the ones of MPs."
Alternative methods to animal tests not fully available by 2013,"In 2010, the European commission appointed a panel of scientific experts to report on the current status and future prospects of alternative methods to animal testing for cosmetics, and to provide realistic estimates of the time required for the development of alternative methods where not already existing. This work was coordinated by theEuropean Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) and underwent a period of public consultation prior to its finalisation and publication in the peer-reviewed journal Archives of Toxicology. According to the experts, considerable scientific challenges still have to be overcome before a full replacement of animal tests will be possible. Whereas substantial progress has been made over the past years, they predict that for toxicokinetics, repeated dose toxicity, carcinogenicity, skin sensitisation, and reproductive toxicity, alternative methods to fully replace animal tests will not be available by 2013. More particularly: – No specific timeline could be estimated in the areas of toxicokinetics, repeated dose toxicity, carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity due to the underlying scientific challenges. – The timelines estimated for full replacement of animal tests in the area of skin sensitisation point to a further 7-9 years (i.e. 2017-2019). This study [1] will be an important input for the Commission's report to the Parliament and the Council expected in mid-2011, regarding the technical difficulties in complying with the ban on animal testing. Indeed, the European Commission must review the situation regarding the technical difficulties in extending the ban to the most complex tests, including skin sensitisation and carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity and toxicokinetics, for which the deadline was set to March 2013. While full replacement is not yet accomplished or possible by 2013, the EU experts argue that there is a potential for partial replacement strategies. In the short to mid-term, providing a combined ""toolbox"" of well-defined test methods with established reliability and relevance for particular purposes, could support the development of integrated testing strategies. ""While each of the methods alone may not be able to generate all required information, their combination might provide a sufficient basis for an integrated safety assessment withthe ultimate aim of completely replacing animal testing."" Animal testing opposition group, the BUAV, expressed extreme disappointment over the content of the final report by EU experts. The group said that delaying the ban will not speed up the development and acceptance of non-animal alternatives. ""Rather, the pressure of a deadline has helped to speed up the development of new alternatives - thereby saving the lives of thousands of animals worldwide."""
French cosmetics makers face MPs vote,"By voting on the 3rd of May, a bill of law proposed by a group of centre-right members of the National Assembly, and aiming at prohibiting the use of endocrine disruptors such as phthalates, alkylphenols and parabens in consumer products, French deputies have caused confusion within the cosmetics industry, generating the utter incomprehension of some and the satisfaction of the others. The Union of Chemical Industries (UIC) said the vote by the National Assembly created utter incomprehension. ""The prohibition of entire categories of substances with very different toxicological profiles, uses, and therefore exposure levels is a scientific, technical and regulatory non-sense,"" commented the organization representing the interests of French chemicals industry. While MPs argue that the effects of these substances and their interactions are not entirely known, the UIC believes that the bill is ""an excessive application of the precautionary principle."" Where the deputies from the Nouveau Centre party said that toxicity studies of endocrine disruptors ""still relies on the definition of daily intake, while potential cocktail effects or the effect of small doses have been hardly or not studied,"" the chemical industry answered that, from a scientific and technical point of view, this is mad with much precipitation as neither the INSERM [1] nor the ANSES [2] that were seized by the Ministry of Health have not made their final risk assessment yet. According to the UIC, endocrine disruptors even lack a validated definition at European level. The UIC also emphasizes the usefulness of the suspected substances in daily life: phthalates render some plastics flexible, parabens inhibit the proliferation of pathogenic microorganisms in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, and derivatives of alkylphenols are used as emulsifiers. ""Today, many of these applications are not technically substitutable,"" according to the UIC. As far as NGOs are concerned, their position is obviously very different. André Cicolella, spokesman for the Réseau Environnement Santé, welcomes ""the lucid and courageous vote of French deputies"" that he hopes it will not be without incidence on the Commission and Member States of the European Union. For manufacturers of natural and organic cosmetics, the vote of French deputies has the advantage of consolidating their own position regarding the use of synthetic chemicals. According to Thierry Logre, CEO of Laboratories Phyt's, a leading maker of organic cosmetics in France, the vote strengthens its brand's strategy, which since its inception 40 years ago, refuses the use of parabens. ""From the outset, we learned how to make products without synthetic preservatives, according to a methodology of our own,"" he says. Indeed, according to Thierry Logre, there are ""many questions related to these substances."" He particularly stresses the uncertainties regarding their ""chronic toxicity"" that is extremely difficult to assess. ""So when they say that parabens have a very positive toxicological profile, they only speak about acute toxicity, but they pretend to ignore the consequences of the accumulation of small daily doses absorbed by the skin."" However, Thierry Logre does not claim for victory. ""Parabens should not hide other synthetic preservatives, such as phenoxyethanol or formaldehyde precursors,"" he warns. Above all, he knows that the new legislation must still be approved by the Senate which will have to resist ""pressure from the government."" Indeed, the bill proposed by MP Yvan Lachaud (Nouveau Centre) was adopted against the opinion of the government and despite a negative vote by the Assembly's Commission of Social Affairs. To date, the examination of the text is not scheduled in the work load of the Senate for weeks to come. In France, the government decides of the Parliament's agenda, but lawmakers still have the opportunity to schedule the examination of their own proposals during the ""parliament niches"", i.e. days that are dedicated to them. In this framework, all options are possible: from the approbation by the senators on the bill in the same terms, which would mean it become a law applicable upon publication in the Official Journal after its promulgation by the President of the Republic, to the mere rejection of the text or, more likely to date, a vote amending the Assembly's text. Meanwhile, social networks and blogs devoted to cosmetic products, clearly expressed strong supports to the text voted by the National Assembly. What makes some people consider that, in any case, these substances are publicly condemned."
Sweden: Controls detect large numbers of non-compliant products,"As part of its market surveillance activities, the Agency tested 99 skincare creams available in Sweden, mostly products manufactured in Scandinavia. The products were submitted to laboratory testing, in particular for assessing their compliance with the rules applying to the use of preservatives. In its Report on the supervision system of cosmetic and hygiene products [1], Läkemedelsverket points out numerous non-compliances, regarding both undeclared preservatives and erroneous information on labels. The analyses revealed that 20 products contained one or more preservatives that were not declared in the list of ingredients. According the Swedish Agency, one reason is that manufacturers are sometimes ignorant of the presence of these preservatives in the ingredients they use. Yet, full knowledge of the product formulation falls within the scope of responsibility of marketers, warns Läkemedelsverket. ""However, none of the tested products showed microbiological hazards, which is yet a satisfactory result,"" said Monica Tammela, head of the cosmetic and hygiene products unit. Results regarding labels controls are even more catastrophic since 76 non-compliant products were detected out of 99 tested! These problems concern inaccuracies or errors in the labelling of business names or addresses, errors regarding the quantity of product claimed, the durability after opening, but also errors about the warnings or precautions of use, the batch numbers or the list of ingredients. Following these controls, some companies have decided to stop the sale of certain non-complying products. Furthermore, the Agency has also decided to prohibit the sale of products where important problems were identified or where the concerned company were not able to produce the necessary corrective actions. The detailed report is available here below (in Swedish):"
Intertek wants to partner with brands for quality and safety,"For perfumes and cosmetics exporters, the agreement signed between the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) and the two leading companies in quality control and products safety, Intertek and SGS, should not bring many changes in the short term. Certification is from now on only carried out by the two certification bodies approved by the SFDA, which are precisely those who already were doing most of the controls. According to Aurélie Moreau, in charge of the cosmetics industry for Intertek, ""this agreement will mostly allow us to work more closely with the SFDA, particularly to address technical issues that are a source of concerns for manufacturers."" An important aspect in view of the transfer to the SFDA of the standard-setting activity currently undertaken by the Saudi Arabian Standards Organization (SASO). Today, Intertek does not want to content itself with just being a surrogate of Saudi governmental bodies. ""We have in France a centre dedicated to regulatory affairs, which allows us to provide exporters with local expertise and to keep them informed on the latest regulatory updates"", explained Aurélie Moreau. Services that the British group would like to continue to develop in all countries requiring certification of shipments, such as Algeria, Kenya and Russia. With a network of more than 1,000 laboratories and offices and over 27,000 employees in more than a hundred countries, Intertek has an unparalleled testing capacity and offers a set of services to support the quality demand of brands in the beauty industry. Since the acquisition of the 4-Front company in 2008, Intertek has become a recognized leader on the market of clinical trials, tolerance tests, verification of the activity of active ingredients on their substrates, be it, for hair, skin or teeth, toxicological risk assessment, and efficacy tests. With its knowledge in regulations and of international certifications requirements, Intertek also offers services for the preparation and validation of the cosmetic file, the writing of safety data sheets (SDS), and of quality and compliance control (microbiological testing, dosing of preservatives, etc.). The strengthening of regulations and of safety requirements the world over, offers the company, huge opportunities especially with the supply chain. ""Brands will soon have to insure that both their raw material suppliers and packaging suppliers, meet the REACH requirements, and by 2013 the compliance of cosmetic production sites to Good Manufacturing Practices recognized in the European Union will be mandatory"", warned Aurélie Moreau. Even the rise of ecology and a concern for natural products are accompanied by requirements for independent controls and for guarantees to new consumers. ""Consumers are both better informed and more cautious vis-à-vis environmental claims. Intertek offers, thanks to its laboratory tests and its experts, a support regarding environmental claims."" And it can go as far as the realization of a life cycle analysis. ""We are anticipating the needs of brands in the prospect of the general implementation of environmental labelling"", emphasised Aurélie Moreau."
UK to tackle misleading retouched cosmetics ads,"A new advertising guidance published yesterday addresses the cosmetics sector with the aim to help the industry to advertise their products without misleading consumers. The so-called new Help Note on 'The use of production techniques in cosmetics advertising' was issued by the Committee of Advertising Practice (CAP) and the Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice (BCAP), the bodies that regulate advertising practices in the United Kingdom. They also sought expertise from the Cosmetics, Toiletries and Perfumery Association (CTPA), the trade association representing the cosmetics industry. CAP and BCAP acted following a request from the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) Council for greater clarification on the use of pre and post production techniques in cosmetic ads. Indeed, in recent years, the ASA has received several complaints about the use of eyelash inserts, hair extensions and styling, as well as photographic retouching in advertisements for cosmetic products, on the grounds that they can misleadingly exaggerate the effect a product is capable of achieving. L'Oreal, for instance, came under fire in 2007 after an advertising over its ""Telescopic Mascara"" TV ads starring actress Penelope Cruz was deemed misleading. Actually, Cruz was found to be wearing individual false eyelashes. In order to address these issues, the Help Note gives examples of production techniques that, depending on their use, are likely to mislead and those that are not. For instance, are considered as likely to mislead: – 'Before-and-after' images where only the 'after' image had used pre-production techniques – The use of lash inserts that are longer or thicker than the model's natural lashes or that do more than replace damaged or missing lashes – Re-touching, for example, removing or reducing the appearance of lines and wrinkles around the eyes for an eye cream advertisement or increasing the length or thickness of eyelashes in an advertisement for mascara – The excessive use of hair extensions or inserts that significantly adds to hair volume in hair care advertisements Are considered as unlikely to mislead: – The use of styling and make-up generally – The use of lash inserts for non-eye area cosmetics – The use of hair extensions and inserts for non-hair care cosmetics – Minor adjustments to correct for lighting problems and other photographic issues – Removal of skin blemishes provided this does not affect the impression given of the effectiveness of the product The Help Note also makes clear that while disclaimers or qualifiers can be used to clarify claims, if an advertisement is inherently misleading, it remains so regardless of any superimposed text. ""This guidance provides a clear set of principles that will be of real benefit to the cosmetics sector, helping them promote their products in a positive light without misleading the consumer,"" said Shahriar Coupal, CAP Secretary. Earlier this month, French cosmetics brand Make Up For Ever debuted world's first unretouched make-up ad. The detailed document is available here below:"
Natural and organic cosmetics: what prospects for harmonization?,"Premium Beauty News - What is the current situation concerning the attempts to harmonize the definitions on natural and organic cosmetics? Laurence Mulon - At a European level, a first step was taken with the association COSMOS-standard AISBL, who last February 16, announced the start of the ""Cosmos-natural"" and ""Cosmos biological"" certifications. Five certifying body are now empowered to grant certification according to the Cosmos standard: BDIH, EcoCertGreenlife, ICEA, Qualité France and Soil Association Certification Ldt. A certification process will soon be available for new certifying bodies. No common logo is planned for the time being, just a common signature. For its part the NaTrue label, created by German industrialists is developing itself in the U.S. through the negotiation of mutual recognition agreements with NSF/ANSI. Premium Beauty News - Are authorities also trying to help clarify things? Laurence Mulon - Natural and organic cosmetics are in the spotlight of the European Commission who has initiated the creation of two working groups: one at the level of the CEN [1] for the standardization of methods, and the other one at the level of the DG SANCO [2], within the subgroup ""cosmetic claims"". This latter group, however, decided in February 2011 to wait for the recommendations of the ISO working group on the terminology of natural and organic cosmetics before it would start giving its own recommendations for this category. Premium Beauty News - So ISO seems concerned about this subject too? Laurence Mulon - Yes, since 2009, at the instigation of the Colipa, the European association of cosmetic manufacturers. In practice, it is a working group on terminology (WG No. 4 Terminology) from the technical committee on cosmetics [3] who is trying to define natural and organic cosmetics. This working group has a wide international audience, because a number of countries have an approach to natural cosmetics which is related to their traditional uses but few countries have developed their own standards. The members of the group met twice in 2010, in June and October. The draft of definitions submitted by the Colipa was commended by all parties. There was unanimity on one point: the future standard will not cover labelling or product claims. This first project, greatly inspired by western approaches should integrate the traditional approaches of use of plants and natural extracts in cosmetics, and in particular India's point of view. On the other hand, participants will have to agree on the methods of calculation of extracts and on the status of water. Premium Beauty News - Is all this work likely to clarify things for consumers? Laurence Mulon - The clarification expected by consumers is not for now. At the European level, the new Cosmos standard, that groups major European labels proposes a transition period during which will coexist on the European market, products certified according to national standards, to Cosmos standards and to the NaTrue label. The ISO standard is not expected before 2013. What will be the situation then? Will Cosmos have imposed itself? Will the NaTrue label have attracted other continents? Or will the national approaches of each country be favoured? Manufacturers will have to make strategic choices according to the targeted market, not only on the choice of the standard but also on the choice of the certifying body. Not to mention the fact that some new labels are emerging. Some claims go further than the simple environmental approach by adding to them an ethical dimension, such as for example: Bio équitable, ESR, ""Main dans la main"", or an environmental approach focused on biodiversity, which is the case for ""Forest Garden Products""."
The proliferation in natural and organic cosmetic standards continues,"Although the adoption rate of natural and organic cosmetic standards is the highest in Europe, the region is also the most fragmented in terms of seals and logos. Standards are mainly adopted on a national basis, with few transcending national boundaries. The Soil Association standard is almost exclusively adopted by UK companies, ICEA almost entirely by Italian companies, Cosmebio mostly by French companies, and BDIH predominantly in Germany. In order to simplify and harmonise the certification schemes in Europe, the six leading certification bodies have introduced the Cosmos standard and the first certified products are expected this year. However, Organic Monitor deems that, since no common logo is planned, the new Cosmos standard ""will not replace or unify the plethora of existing symbols and logos."" Nevertheless, a strong asset of the Cosmos standard is the international coverage of one of its members: Ecocert. Originating in France, the standard has been adopted by companies in Greece, Denmark, Latvia, Brazil, India, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Australia. The Ecocert logo is becoming recognised as 'the organic logo' in some of these countries. ""With the large number of licensees and certified products of Ecocert and its fellow Cosmos partners, Cosmos has the potential to become a de facto global standard,"" adds the market research firm. Natrue, the other European standard with international ambitions, now covers almost 1,400 products, but has its actual popularity limited to German-speaking countries where are based most of its 55 licensees. However, contrarily to Ecocert and its Cosmos fellows, Natrue is making inroads in North America. ""High interest in standards and a flurry of re-formulation activity is occurring in North America since Whole Foods announced its new guidelines for personal care products a year ago,"" explains Organic Monitor. So far, the NPA standard for natural cosmetics is the most successful. As far as organics are concerned, the NSF ANSI 305 'contains organic' standard is gaining currency, but the USDA NOP organic standard remains popular in spite of it designed for organic agricultural food products. Thus, three separate standards and logos are gaining momentum in North America, and a fourth one is expected since Natrue and NSF ANSI have announced the launch of a new natural cosmetics standard last month. ""With this new initiative, Natrue has become embroiled in two major standard battles in Europe and North America."" There are currently no local certification schemes in the fast-growing Asian and Latin American markets for natural cosmetics. Local players use European schemes to fill the void, but are also supporting the development of national or regional certification, like in Australia with the OFC [1] and ACO [2] organic cosmetic standards. In developing countries, governmental authorities could play an important role in advocating or introducing natural and organic cosmetic standards, according to Organic Monitor. Taiwan and Brazil could support the development of certification through local standards. ""The proliferation in seals and logos, especially at the national level, could widen divisions in an already fragmented natural cosmetics industry,"" Organic Monitor says."
First congress on alternatives to animal testing in China,"For the first time ever, the People's Republic of China is exploring alternatives to animal testing. This issue will be the subject of the first edition of the International Forum on Cosmetic Technology and Applications, initiated and organised by the China Cosmetics Research Centre of the Beijing Technology and Business University. According to the organisers, the purpose of this first congress on ""alternatives to animal experimentation for cosmetics"" is to ""increase communication and cooperation within the international cosmetic community, remove technology barriers to cosmetic safety assessment, exchange information on international cosmetic technology and application, and look into the future of the cosmetic industry in China."" The organisers plan to invite representatives from companies and trade organizations, researchers and experts from research institutes in the European Union, America, Japan and South Korea, as well as Chinese experts in cosmetics studies, government officials from relevant Chinese supervision departments, and cosmetic companies in China. In a context where animal tests for cosmetics and their ingredients have been banned in the European Union and while they are regressing in most countries, the current Chinese legislation appears somewhat out of phase with the general trend. Indeed, tests on animal are compulsory to assess the safety of cosmetics placed on the Chinese market, even where validated alternatives exist. In the long run, this gap between Chinese and international standards may pose problem to China's trade. Through this congress, China's industry and administration intend to get more information about current legal requirements and technologies related to alternatives to animal experimentation for cosmetics in several countries. Major cosmetics companies such as Amore Pacific, Chanel, Estee Lauder, L'Oréal, LG, Mary Kay, P&G, Shiseido, Unilever are supporting this initiative. The first ""International Forum on Cosmetic Technology and Applications - Alternatives to Animal Experimentation for Cosmetics,"" will be held in Beijing on April 11th and 12th, 2011 at the Beijing Xiyuan Hotel (No.1, Sanlihe Road, Hadian District, Beijing 100044). The deadline to submit papers is March 15th, 2011. Registration form here below:"
Natural cosmetics: NPA fears increased confusion for the U.S. consumer,"Premium Beauty News - What is NPA's role in the certification of natural personal care products? John Gay - Celebrating its 75th anniversary this year, the Natural Products Association is the largest and oldest nonprofit organization dedicated to the natural products industry. NPA represents over 1,900 members accounting for more than 10,000 retailers, manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors of natural products, including foods, dietary supplements, and health and beauty aids. Among its many activities, NPA provides several self-regulatory quality assurance programs, including a good manufacturing practices certification for dietary supplement manufacturers and the NPA Natural Seal, the first and only natural certification in the U.S. Every day, NPA helps millions of people find truly natural personal care and home care products, awarding the NPA Natural Seal to products that are certified as 95 percent natural. NPA-certified products appear in more than 85,000 stores nationwide, ranging from independent retailers to some of the largest chains in the country. More than 500 personal care products and ingredients from more than 45 companies, both large and small, have been certified natural by NPA. You can get a complete list of products at www.TheNaturalSeal.org. Premium Beauty News - How are the audits conducted? Dr. Cara Welch - Each certified product or ingredient undergoes a third-party certification by a qualified auditor. NPA staff collects all the required documentation and provides complete packets for the auditor who then examines each submission and provides for NPA an audit report approving, if applicable, the certification. Premium Beauty News - NATRUE and NSF International recently announced they are cooperating to create an internationally harmonized US standard. They argue that such a standard would allow all stakeholders to take part to discussions? Dr. Cara Welch - The NPA Natural Standard was written by collaborating manufacturers, suppliers and retailers in the natural personal care industry. We launched the Natural Seal program to define the term ""natural"" in the US personal care industry for manufacturers, retailers and consumers. We believe a second natural standard will actually work to confuse the U.S. consumer as to what is a truly natural personal care product. We understand the importance for international harmonization and had previously worked toward an agreement with NATRUE in order to simplify the audit process for manufacturers looking to certify under both standards. At this point, however, NPA will continue to develop and grow our Natural Seal program and strengthen the natural personal care product industry. Premium Beauty News - As far as personal care products are concerned, what are your projects for the future? John Gay - NPA will continue to build on its success with the NPA Natural Seal program, continuing to certify more products and ingredients for the industry and consumers. NPA also advocates for the rights of consumers to have access to these and other products that benefit their health. Each year, NPA hosts Natural Products Day in Washington, D.C. This year, we expect more than 150 retailers and manufacturers to join us on April 6. Natural Products Day provides an opportunity for NPA members and others in the industry to meet with members of Congress. For more information, visit www.npainfo.org/NPD11."
Kao sues Henkel over hair dyes,"Japan's cosmetic giant, Kao Corporation has filed infringement lawsuits against German manufacturer of consumer goods Henkel and its Japanese subsidiary Schwarzkopf & Henkel K.K. claiming the Düsseldorf-headquartered firm has infringed its intellectual property rights for a foaming hair-colouring agent. Kao filed two suits, one in Düsseldorf and another in Tokyo, demanding that Henkel ceases the sale of products infringing its patents and pays compensations for damages. According to Kao, Henkel's foam type hair colour products marketed under the brand Schwarzkopf Perfect Mousse, which was launched in September 2010, would infringe one of its German Utility Model. Kao also alleges that foam type hair colour products Fresh Light marketed in Japan by Schwarzkopf & Henkel K.K. since September 2010 also infringe one of its Japanese patents. ""Kao's German Utility Model and Japanese Patent relate to a two agent foam type hair dye in a non-aerosol vessel and are key intellectual property rights that support Kao's beauty care business,"" said the Japanese company in a release. After starting development of this technology in 2002, Kao commercially launched the first corresponding applications in Japan in July 2007, thereby establishing a ""foam type"" category in the hair dye market. Kao also launched products using this technology in Hong Kong in July 2009, and thereafter in Singapore, Malaysia, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Sales were initiated in the United States, Thailand, and Taiwan at the beginning of this year and Kao says it is planning to expand sales to other countries."
EU confirms ban on musk xylene,"The European Commission has just announced its decision to move musk xylene [1] from the candidate list to the authorisation list, known as Annex IV, under the REACH regulation. [2] This means it will be phased out since substances in Annex XIV cannot be placed on the market or used unless authorisation has been granted for a specific use. Musk xylene is a fragrance material that once ranked among the most widely used synthetic musks in the perfumery industry before declining in the early 1990s. As a very persistent and very bioaccumulative pollutant in the aquatic environment, musk xylene was the first substance to be proposed as a ""substance of very high concern"" under the REACH regulation. The Commission also announced the ban of five other substances: 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane (MDA), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD), bis(2-ethylexyl) phthalate (DEHP), benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP). ""These substances are carcinogenic, toxic for reproduction or persist in the environment and accumulate in living organisms. Operators wishing to sell or use these substances will need to demonstrate that the required safety measures have been taken to adequately control the risks, or that the benefits for the economy and society outweigh the risks,"" the Commission explains in a release. The six substances will be phased out within the next three to five years. However, the move to Annex IV should hardly have any impact on the fragrance industry since the International Fragrance Association (IFRA) had already voluntarily withdrawn musk xylene from perfumes' formulas through the fragrance industry's global self-regulation programme. ""We have always taken our responsibilities for safety very seriously and once again our self-regulatory approach has proved to be more up to date with current scientific knowledge, faster to implement and cheaper for industry and consumers,"" said Pierre Sivac, IFRA President. Actually, IFRA banned musk xylene in June 2009 [3], based on risk assessments carried out by an independent Expert Panel [4] that deemed the substance had potential effects on the environment. According to IFRA, its membership accounts for approximately 90% of the global volume of fragrance materials."
"""We want clear, stringent, and globally harmonised standards for natural cosmetics,"" Julie Tyrrell, NATRUE","Premium Beauty News - In only few years, NATRUE has succeeded to become one of the main labels for natural and organic cosmetics in Europe. Julie Tyrrell - First of all, when NATRUE was established - in 2007 - the intention was not to come out with a label for natural and organic cosmetics. The European manufacturers who joined forces and founded NATRUE had encouraged discussions that led to the Cosmos standard [1] but they did not find the outcome satisfactory. At that time, the European cosmetics directive was going through a process of simplification that eventually led to the new regulation [2]. Thus, we thought it would be possible to introduce provisions about natural and organic cosmetics within the framework of the new regulation. However, when I opened the NATRUE secretariat, in 2008, it was already too late. NATRUE's founding members were pioneers in Europe in the field of natural cosmetics. For instance, companies such as Weleda and Dr. Hauschka have been operating in this market for 90 years! They always campaigned in favour of international - not national - standards, with stringent and transparent criteria. They want natural and organic standards for cosmetic products to be consumer driven, not something the industry is fitting to a trend. Premium Beauty News - NATRUE and NSF International recently announced their partnership to develop the first U.S. national standard for natural cosmetics. Julie Tyrrell - This initiative is not new for NATRUE. Today the market for natural and organic cosmetics is international and many players in this market are international too. As soon as it was founded, NATRUE had discussions with its US counterparts. In January 2009, a NATRUE delegation went to the US and met with the Natural Products Association (NPA) and with NSF International with the objective to join forces to be bear the industry thought at a transatlantic level. Unfortunately, since that time NPA has been holding us back because of unanswered questions regarding ingredients and the certification process. As far as NATRUE is concerned, things are clear. Harmonisation needs to agree on common criteria but also on transparent certification processes. Despite visits to the USA and an important number of conference calls, we were not able to clear up these questions. Meanwhile however we agreed with NSF International on the mutual recognition between their NSF 305 and the NATRUE Level 2 [3]. We also recently signed a memorandum of understanding for the use of the NATRUE Level 1 (natural cosmetics) as the basis for an ANSI (American International Standards Institute) standard. Indeed, the existing NPA standard is not recognised by ANSI, it's a private standard. What NATRUE wants is not just a standard, but stringent and internationally harmonised criteria the consumers can trust. ANSI, which is the ISO official representative in the USA, requires American standards to be elaborated in a transparent and open process, with all stakeholders being represented. That is what we seek too: transparency, stringent criteria, independent certification, open process, harmonization. Premium Beauty News – Commenting on the co-operation between NATRUE and NSF in view of a new standard, NPA said it would do ""no service to natural products customers, retailers, or manufacturers."" [4] Julie Tyrrell - The future ANSI standard will differ from the NPA one as it will not be a private standard but an official US standard. NPA was invited to join this process, and still can, the original idea was to work with them. In view of the inability to make any progress with NPA, we informed them before Christmas that we would go ahead, anyway, because we want an ANSI standard providing clarity for consumers and a better international harmonisation. NPA is still welcome to join the process. Actually, we are somewhat frustrated about NPA and their behaviour. Premium Beauty News - Is this partnership between NATRUE and NSF independent from economic considerations? Julie Tyrrell - There is absolutely no direct financial interests in this collaboration. NATRUE is a 100% not for profit organisation, and there is no financial interest for NATRUE in this partnership! NATRUE is a membership-based organisation, and we get an administrative fee for each product that is certified under one of the three levels of the NATRUE standard. [5] Premium Beauty News - How do you ensure transparency? Julie Tyrrell - Our website is an important tool for transparency. Every single NATRUE-certified product enjoys a whole dedicated webpage, including its name, its certification level, what makes it special, information concerning the companies behind the product etc. In practice, at the point of sale (POS), that is to say where it really matters, consumers can simply use their cell phones to scan the QR-tag that is on NATRUE-certified products, or enter the corresponding short URL in a web browser, and thus reach all this detailed information. The QR-tag is already widespread in Asia and is becoming increasingly common in Europe. We are at the leading edge of this innovative. For us the POS is a point of experience, where products must ""speak"" to consumers, tell about what they contain or not contain, etc. The QR-tag is really a great opportunity for natural cosmetics makers because they have so much to say about their products. Premium Beauty News - What will be the benefits of the co-operation between NATRUE and NSF? Julie Tyrrell - The key benefit of harmonization between standards is clarity for consumers. As far as manufacturers are concerned, our aim is to lower the cost of certification. We try to work with certification bodies that are common to both standards. In practice, for instance, it means only one factory audit instead of two. It is really important in an industry where there are many small companies. Also it should not be forgotten that multiple certification costs also impact the cost of the end product to the consumer so harmonization also plays a positive role in this regard, it is a win-win situation. Premium Beauty News - What about the future of the natural cosmetics market? Julie Tyrrell - In my opinion, the biggest danger is green-washing and watered down standards. One year after the launch of NATRUE we commissioned a study that revealed that consumers have lost trust in the industry. I think, the danger is that nature-inspired companies look for the easiest solution instead of really working to provide high quality natural and organic products. Premium Beauty News – What about the perspectives regarding international harmonisation? Julie Tyrrell - I am quite positive about this. Considering the discussions we are having at a global level, I am sure it is possible. NATRUE is there to ensure the definition of natural cosmetics will still rely on stringent criteria, and the partnership with NSF is a step in this direction. And there are other initiatives on the way."
Towards a US standard to define natural cosmetics,"A new U.S. standard may soon compete with the NPA standard for Personal Care Products to define what a ""natural cosmetic"" might be. Indeed, NSF International, a testing and certification organization accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and Natrue, a Brussels-based organisation promoting natural and organic cosmetics, have announced their partnership to develop the first U.S. standard on this issue. In practice, NSF International will use the Natrue Standard Level 1 [1] as the base for the development of the new American standard, which will be elaborated in an open forum using a consensus-based process, with a committee having balanced membership of interested stakeholders, including members of industry as well as regulators, academia and consumers. As it will not represent the point of view of a single trade association, it will therefore comply with ANSI requirements to be recognized as an official American National Standard, which is not the case of the NPA standard. Transatlantic harmonization According to Natrue, ""the partnership marks an important step towards international harmonization and a globally recognized definition of natural in personal care product."" Actually, the future standard should make life easier for producers of natural cosmetics who wish to sell their products both sides of the Atlantic. In 2010, Natrue already signed an equivalency agreement for the Natrue Level 2 and the NSF/ANSI 305 standard. This mutual-recognition agreement concerned products cosmetics manufactured with organic ingredients, referred to as products 'containing organic'. In addition to their cooperation on the new American standard for natural personal care, Natrue and NSF have also signed an agreement to harmonize the criteria for these two standards. While this new agreement is presented as a means to eliminate confusion among consumers it is not sure it will significantly improve a situation that is actually getting increasingly complex with the perspective of two standards competing to define natural cosmetics in the U.S.A. This strategic move can also be viewed as another step in the competition between certification bodies before the publication of the ISO standard on natural and organic cosmetic, which is currently under discussion.

New ISO standard to assess toxicity of inhaled nanoparticles,"The rapid progress of the nanosciences and the spread of nanotechnologies and nano-based products, in particular in the fields of medicine, beauty and cosmetics, IT, advanced materials, food and even packaging, are raising concerns among researchers, manufacturers, regulators and consumers. This is ""a relatively new technology, scientists still have a lot to learn about nanoparticles,"" says the ISO in a release. Dr. Peter Hatto, Chair of the committee that developed the standard explains, ""With the rapid expansion of nanotechnology applications comes a growing risk of exposure to potentially toxic substances, especially for workers in nanotechnology-based industries. Moreover, if airborne nanoparticles were liberated from products, the general public could also be affected. Ensuring the safety of these particles is therefore paramount for the well-being of workers and consumers."" Developed by the ISO technical committee devoted to nanotechnologies (ISO/TC 229), the new ISO 10808:2010 ""Nanotechnologies - Characterization of nanoparticles in inhalation exposure chambers for inhalation toxicity testing"" aims to address a part of these issues. The purpose of the standard is to ensure that the results of existing inhalation tests measuring the inhalation toxicity of airborne nanoparticles are reliable and harmonized worldwide. ""In order to test inhalation toxicity it is necessary to monitor concentration, size and size-distribution of nanoscale particles in an inhalation chamber. Traditional methods used in other areas are considered insufficient for testing nanoparticles since parameters specific to them like particle surface area or number, might be crucial determinants of toxicity. ISO 10808 takes into account the particular characteristics and potential risks of nanoparticles, and is thus an important asset to the industry,"" Dr. Hatto adds. ISO 10808 establishes a battery of inhalation toxicity testing chamber monitoring, including – a differential mobility analyzing system (DMAS), for determining particle number, size, size-distribution, surface area and estimated mass dose, – as well as morphological examination using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped, – and an energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDXA) for chemical composition."
France: Teething troubles for environmental information,"It was during the Grenelle de l'environnement [1] that the idea emerged on informing consumers on the environmental impact of products they were buying. This proposal was translated into legal terms in the Article 59 of the Law of August 3rd 2009, called ""Grenelle 1"" [2]. According to the text, consumers must be able to access ""sincere, objective and comprehensive environmental information on overall characteristics of the product/packaging couple."" The early versions of the law called ""Grenelle 2"" provided for the gradual implementation of this provision from January 1st 2011. But, given technical difficulties and the huge costs of implementation, MPs strongly reduced the scope of the law. Thus, the text finally enacted on July 12th, 2010 [3], only provided for the implementation of a one year experimental period as of July 1st 2011. At the end of this period, a report would be forwarded to the Parliament to assess whether or not to generalize the experiment. Given the lack of enthusiasm from the current parliamentary majority, concerning environmental issues, it is quite unlikely that the idea of a compulsory labelling extended to all products will emerge shortly. Actually, even environmental organizations seem to have better things to focus on! Considering the implementation of this environmental information requirement very complex in comparison to the immediate benefits, they have let, during debates on the law ""Grenelle 2"", the former requirement turn into an experiment. Eventually, issues concerning energy savings in construction and transport and agricultural policies have seemed more important to tackle. However, they would have preferred a deadline to be set for the experimentation phase, and the environmental information to become compulsory by 2014. As for cosmetics, the FEBEA, the French trade association representing the manufacturers cosmetic products, is in charge of the secretarial work for the Working Group in charge of studying the implementation of the environmental information in this sector. Until then considered very proactive, the professional organization appears now much more cautious. According to several participants of the Working Group, the publication, in the short-term, of a guide on environmental labelling of shampoos, which was to be the cosmetic industry's contribution to this national experiment was delayed. The main reason to this: significant methodological difference of opinion between stakeholders. The overall approach initially adopted by the Working Group was actually called into question, some participants wishing to step up the process by only focusing on greenhouse gas emissions, in the wake of what was undertaken in the United Kingdom. The general feeling being that the deadline set for the beginning of the experiment (July 1st, 2011) was anyway very optimistic given the scope of the task. However, many manufacturers are eager to see the file make some progress. If only because they have already worked hard to gather the necessary information concerning the implementation of the labelling. According to Philippe de Brugière, Vice President, in charge of the Packaging development of L'Occitane, and who did not participate to the work of the Working Group, but who nonetheless followed them closely, ""a lot of work has already been achieved, but resources to mobilize are important and obviously industry players have everything to gain in pooling their efforts."" As far as L'Occitane is concerned a global approach was preferred. Beyond the mere measurement of greenhouse gas emissions, the French cosmetics maker and retailer seeks to evaluate the entire impact of its products on non-renewable resources, air and water pollution, etc. ""We hired a person that has been exclusively working on this issue for one year,"" says Philippe de Brugière. ""We have made important progress, while some data about certain ingredients are still missing."""
Europe's final ban on animal testing may be delayed,"As far as cosmetics are concerned, the European Union has already banned mosttests on animals. The testing ban on finished products applies since 11 September 2004; and the testing ban on ingredients or combination of ingredients applies since 11 March 2009, with the exception of repeated-dose toxicity, reproductive toxicity and toxicokinetics. These latter tests should have been prohibited step by step, as soon as alternative methods are validated and adopted in EU legislation, and before 11 March 2013. However, the development and validation of alternative methods seems to have been longer than initially expected and several voices from the industry argue that applying the ban on these final tests irrespectively of the availability of alternative non-animal tests could seriously hinder the innovation capacity of Europeans cosmetics makers. Apparently, they have been listened by the authorities. Opening an exhibition held at the European Parliament and organised by Colipa, the European Cosmetics Association, Commissioner John Dalli highlighted the importance of innovation. ""Colipa can be assured that we will continue to do our utmost to support innovation through EU legislation and through our international activities,"" said the Commissioner who is responsible for Health and Consumer Policy in the Union. Furthermore, Neil Parish, a member of the British Parliament and chairman of a parliamentary group for animal welfare, said that sufficient replacement safety tests would not be available until 2017, four years later than expected, The Guardian reported. Parish also criticized the cosmetics industry that he accused of deliberately delaying the development of alternative methods. Actually, several industry experts expect the European commission - who must publish an annual report on progress made in the development, validation and legal acceptance of alternative methods - will announce shortly that it is unable to introduce the last phase of the cosmetics directive in 2013 as initially planned."
"Parabens are safe for use but red hair dye n° 16 poses risks, says EU scientific committee","Parabens, a family of preservatives, have been the subject of several controversies regarding their safety in cosmetic products. A consequence on the market has been the mushrooming of paraben-free personal care products. But parabens used in cosmetics are safe, according to a recent draft opinion of the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS), an experts panel that provides the European Commission with opinions on health and safety risks of non-food consumer products. [1] The draft opinion re-iterates a June 2008 opinion confirming the safety of two parabens, methyl and ethyl parabens, at current maximum authorized concentrations (0.4%). However, when this earlier opinion was adopted, the scientific committee required further data before a final opinion on other parabens would be considered. The industry therefore generated and submitted additional data on butylparaben and propylparaben, the other categories (isopropyl, isobutyl, phenyl, benzyl and pentyl parabens) being considered of no commercial importance. After having reviewed all the available information, including the possible relationship between the use of parabens and the development of breast cancer, the estrogenic and androgenic properties of parabens, and their dermal absorption, the SCCS said, in its new opinion, that butylparaben and propylparaben can be used safely in cosmetics, ""as long as the sum of their individual concentrations does not exceed 0.19%"". The 0.19% threshold is to put in relation with the current legal limitations, which are significantly higher. Indeed, European cosmetics regulations permit the use of parabens in cosmetic products at a maximum concentration of 0.4% (and 0.8% for a mixture). [2] However, according to the Cosmetics Toiletry and Perfumery Association (CTPA), the voice of British cosmetics makers, limits proposed by the SCCS are ""in line with industry practice"". In practice, the maximum concentrations proposed by the SCCS are rarely exceeded in cosmetics, and industry experts say that very few products on the market fall outside of this range. The SCCS added it was not able to assess the safety of other parabens (isopropyl, isobutyl, phenyl, benzyl and pentyl parabens) for which limited to no information was submitted. In addition to parabens, the SCCS also published draft opinions on two hair dyes, HC Yellow n° 13 with the chemical name 4-(2'-Hydroxyethyl)-amino-3- nitrotrifluormethylbenzene, and HC Red n° 16 with the chemical name N-(2-nitro-4-aminophenyl)- allylamine (B114). HC Yellow n° 13 is considered as safe at a maximum on-head concentration of 2.5% in oxidative and non-oxidative hair dye formulations, despite the fact that a sensitising potential cannot be excluded. On the contrary, the SCCS says that the use of HC Red n° 16 as a hair dye ingredient within current admissible on-head concentrations (0.75% under oxidative and 1.5% under non-oxidative conditions) poses a risk to the health of the consumer, due a low margin of safety. These opinions, including the one on parabens, are open for comments until January 28, 2011."
Russia: regulatory changes in sight for cosmetics,"Premium Beauty News - For several months, there has been much talk about regulatory reforms in Russia. What is it all about? Olga Lambert - Two major reforms are going to directly affect cosmetic products. It concerns firstly, the adoption of Technical Regulations on fragrances and cosmetics and, secondly, the creation of a Customs Union between Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus, a first step towards a genuine common market by 2012. Premium Beauty News - How will the Customs Union impact the cosmetics industry? Olga Lambert - First, the level of customs duties will evolve in order to align themselves with the common tariff. But more importantly, the governments of the three countries have reached an agreement on the movement of goods which, like cosmetics, are subject to a compulsory procedure in order to control their compliance. Under the agreement, the relevant products will be tested and certified in one of the member countries according to criteria common to all three countries. The goal is to allow free movement on the whole territory of the Customs Union, without restriction, to picture what is done within the European Union. The creation of the Customs Union leads to logical changes in the procedure of placing on the market of cosmetic products. It should be remembered that this procedure is undertaken through two steps: Firstly, the products' sanitary control and then the declaration of conformity. Sanitary control is now performed at the level of the Customs Union. Depending on products, it can takes the form of either a ""Sanitary Expertise"" or of a ""Registration"".* Are subject to ""Registration"", cosmetic products and oral care products other than those from the family 33 of the HS.] As part of the Sanitary Expertise, the clearance of products requires the presentation of a technical report confirming the safety of products, based on tests conducted in laboratories accredited within the common system of the Member States of the Customs Union. As part of the Registration process, which must be undertaken prior to placing on the market (or before customs clearance for imported goods) several documents are required, including a technical and administrative file provided by the manufacturer, toxicological tests and clinical trials. These data are registered into the unique sanitary base of the Customs Union before the sanitary registration is issued. Finally, with the creation of the Customs Union, Technical Regulations promulgated within the domestic systems of each member country will be common and valid on the territory of the Customs Union. Premium Beauty News - It is within this context that the adoption of the Technical Regulations on fragrances and cosmetics in Russia comes into play? Olga Lambert - Partially. Since 2006, the Russian Government has begun a huge regulatory reform to improve the quality of products manufactured locally and imported. The federal law on technical regulation for cosmetic products and fragrances should be passed by the Duma of the Russian Federation in the coming spring. We can already consider that it is a great step towards an harmonization with the technical rules in force in the European Union. Premium Beauty News - In concrete terms, what will be the changes? Olga Lambert - Technically speaking, Russian regulations will be similar to EU regulations. This first of all concerns ingredients since requirements related to the composition of cosmetic products will be harmonized with the provisions of the EU Directive 76/768/EEC on cosmetics. These requirements are more complete than the characteristics of current local sanitary standards (SanPiN). The main principles of the ""Cosmetic products and fragrances Special Technical Regulations are the following: – The registrant (manufacturer or distributor) shall bear full responsibility for all safety aspects related to cosmetic products; – Cosmetic products and fragrances should not be harmful to human health and environment; – Regulation requirements shall protect consumers against confusion; – State agencies will be in charge of controlling the quality of marketed products. Under the bill, the safety of cosmetic products and fragrances is guaranteed by the compliance to the conditions pertaining to the composition, the microbiological characteristics, the concentrations in toxic elements, toxicological safety, clinical safety, to the conditioning and consumer information. In practice, Technical Regulations will be based on various existing sources with some amendments. Thus, the requirements for microbiological characteristics and concentrations of toxic elements are based on the standards of the Russian Federation, the requirements concerning labelling and consumer information are determined by GOST 51391 standards, ""Cosmetic products and Fragrance"" and consumer information is based on the law on ""The protection of consumer rights."" Like all technical regulations, the text applicable to cosmetics will list product categories that are either subject to a mandatory declaration of conformity or a mandatory certification of compliance. Premium Beauty News - The adoption of the Regulations will lead to changes in procedures for placing on the market? Olga Lambert - Currently, the certificate of compliance is achieved through the declaration of conformity in accordance with GOST R local standards When Technical Regulations come into force, they will become the standard of reference and the certificate of compliance for cosmetic products and fragrances will be granted according to three procedures: – the declaration of conformity or the certificate of compliance according to the standards listed in the Technical Regulations, – or the State registration for cosmetic products intended for children under 3 years, – or the control on products' state of compliance."
China: registration of cosmetics resumed?,"According to information collected by Premium Beauty News on the occasion of theCosmoprof Asia tradeshow, which was held in Hong Kong from the 10th to the 12th of October 2010, registrations of cosmetics imported into China would have partially resumed since the beginning of the month. Indeed, following the change of regulatory framework and the administrative reorganization initiated in April 2010, the registration flow has been suspended. Since then, no product reference obtained the required administrative authorisation, whatever the product, ""special function"" cosmetics or ""general function cosmetics."" About twenty registration applications, covering both ""special function cosmetics"" and ""general cosmetic"", were recently given the green light that is necessary for entering into the Chinese market. ""As far as we are concerned, confirms Ms. Françoise Yidan Li, co-founder and CEO of SEYCO, an agency specializing in the registration of cosmetic products in China, we have obtained the approval of seven products, on behalf of Estee Lauder, one of our clients. And we know that more than ten cosmetic products of other cosmetics companies have obtained the agreement of the administrative authority responsible for the registration."" Françoise Yidan Li is optimistic for the future and is convinced that the process should gradually resume. ""We now understand much better what the authorities are expecting. We now know with much precision what the new registration files must contain and how they must be presented. I think the permits will be allowed to an acceptable pace and the situation will gradually unlock."" According to the regulations of the People's Republic of China, cosmetics are divided into two categories: on the one hand the general function cosmetics, and, the second hand, the products special function products). Whatever their category, all products imported into China must get an approval from the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) before being placed on the market. The SFDA evaluates the product on the basis of a technical and administrative file, which must comply with strict formal rules, and include a series of mandatory tests performed by approved Chinese laboratories, as well as several pieces intended to demonstrate the product's safety and the compliance of its labelling. This regulation only applies to mainland China and not to the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau."
"European cosmetics Regulation: ""The countdown is started!""","""The countdown has started,"" says Anne Dux, Director of Scientific and Regulatory Affairs, at the French Federation of beauty enterprises (FEBEA). ""There are 676 working days before the mandatory implementation of the cosmetics regulation. For a catalogue featuring 50 products, this means that we need to upgrade a file produced every 13.5 days. Those waiting for the 1st January 2013 to get on with the task will have only two days per product! And there are many other items to address."" Actually, the Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 November 2009 on cosmetic products will come into full force on July 13, 2013. The consequences of the text on the producers and marketers of cosmetic products are far from negligible. There are four main levels of impact said Anne Dux: on the catalogue of raw materials, on the production, on cosmetics information files and on the placement on the marketing. ""It's really the priority for companies. On the one hand, there is a lot of work to do. And on the other hand, this work can be started immediately, unlike the update of the cosmetics information file for which some key elements are still missing,"" says Anne Dux. The Regulation lays down several new requirements on raw materials, particularly for the notification of products containing nanomaterials and the defence of substances classified as CMR [1] class 1A and class 1B from 1 by December 2010. Furthermore, REACH is complicating things. It's true that the cosmetics industry is largely a downstream user, which is not responsible for the registration of substances. But the downside of this situation is that the cosmetics industry does not decide what substances must be defended or eventually abandoned. It is important, therefore, to organize a careful monitoring on the raw materials catalogue, considering that the most sensitive ones are those that are used in many formulas. The purpose of such a monitoring is to gather the data that is necessary to update the cosmetics information file, as well as to monitor the behaviour of suppliers and to anticipate the substitutions that would appear necessary. As far as production is concerned, the new Regulation on cosmetics makes clear requirements: respect of good manufacturing practices (GMP) for cosmetics, as specified in the standard ISO 22716, and formalization of the contractual relationship with suppliers, subcontractors and outsourcers. Demonstrating GMP compliance may require applying for a third party certification, which implies of course quite a long preparation. The regulations significantly strengthen the requirements for assessing the safety of cosmetic products. However, these new requirements shall be specified by guidelines published by the European Commission. This publication is expected in the first quarter of 2011 and in the meantime, says Anne Dux, it is difficult to move forward on this issue. However, companies of the beauty industry can immediately organize the mandatory cosmetovigilance scheme. Indeed, they will have to gather all available data on the undesirable effects, including serious undesirable effects, in the report on the cosmetic products safety. ""But this raises the issue of imputability,"" said Anne Dux. Namely it is the question of determining to what extent an undesirable effect is really caused by the use of a cosmetic product. To this end, Afssaps and Colipa have developed common imputabilty method. Article 13 of the new Regulation 1223/2009 provides that before placing a cosmetic on the market with several pieces of information must be notify to the European Commission. The electronic portal allowing to fulfil this formality should be online from January 11, 2012, and a beta version will be put into test in the first quarter of 2011. Finally, the new regulations also require to review contractual relationships with distributors."
Advocacy group calls for more stringent cosmetics regulations in Canada,"The report published on October 18 on the website of the David Suzuki Foundation is based mainly on the results of an online survey to which more than 6,200 persons contributed. The Foundation asked internet users to inspect the ingredient lists of their cosmetic products and to indicate whether they contained one or several substances in a list of twelve sets of chemicals considered as potentially harmful for human health and the environment. The survey provided data about 12,500 personal care products. ""Four out of five of the products entered in the survey contained at least one ingredients with suspected links to environmental or health problems - including cancer, reproductive disorders, asthma and severe allergies,"" states the Foundation. Actually, the list of the ingredients ""to avoid"" proposed by the David Suzuki Foundation is quite long and includes such a large variety of substances that anyone clearly has strong chances to find at least one of them in cosmetics or perfumes: – BHA and BHT – coal tar dyes (including p-phenylenediamine), – DEA, cocamide DEA and lauramide DEA – dibutyl phthalate, – formaldehyde-releasing preservatives (DMDM hydantoin, diazolidinyl urea, imidazolidinyl urea, methenamine, quarternium-15 and sodium hydroxymethylglycinate), – paraben, methylparaben, butylparaben and propylparaben, – parfum (any mixture of fragrance ingredients, in particular because to allergy risks), – PEGs (e.g., PEG-60) because they may be contaminated with 1,4-dioxane, – petrolatum, – siloxanes (cyclotetrasiloxane, cyclopentasiloxane, cyclohexasiloxane and cyclomethicone), – sodium laureth sulfate, because it may be contaminated with 1,4-dioxane, – triclosan. For instance, the Foundation notes that the generic term ""parfum"", which is used on labels to designate the specific fragrance ingredients that manufacturers are not required to disclose, ""was the most commonly reported ingredient, identified in more than half of the products entered in the survey."" According to the David Suzuki Foundation, the results of the survey are enough to demonstrate the loopholes of the Canadian regulation. ""Clearly, we need more effective regulatory action to keep these potentially harmful chemicals out of consumer products,"" said Lisa Gue, environmental health policy analyst with the Foundation. The report identifies several weaknesses in Canada's cosmetics regulations. For example, the fact that ingredients used in personal care products have never been tested for their effects on human health and the environment, in particular when they were introduced on the market before the availability of modern environmental controls. Another example is the lack of legal authority of theCosmetic Ingredient Hotlist, published by Health Canada. The list cannot be enforced directly, in contrast to the European Union's regulation, which explicitly restricts a wide amount of substances, including carcinogens, mutagens and reproductive toxicants. The Foundation also criticizes the complexity of Canadian regulations that leads to apply three different rules to products that seem similar. In theory, a beauty cream can be considered as a mere cosmetic product, or as a natural health product, in the event it would contain natural ingredients with a therapeutic function, or as a drug, when claiming sunprotection. The Foundation eventually asks Health Canada to control commercial use of the terms ""unscented/fragrance-free"" and ""natural/bio/organic"". ""Health Canada monitors cosmetics for their safety and regularly reviews new scientific and regulatory information on cosmetic ingredients as it becomes available,"" answered the Canadian regulatory body in letter."
China: cosmetics registration comes up against new ingredients and traces of harmful substances,"Since April 2010 and the publication of new texts concerning the registration of cosmetic products, no new approval was granted by the Chinese authorities for the marketing of ""special function"" cosmetics [1]. The presentation of the new arrangements for the registration that members of the SFDA made on the occasion of the conference on ""Cosmetics Regulations in Asia"" organized by Premium Beauty News on October 14, was therefore eagerly awaited. Mr. Huang Jiansheng, Director of the Center for Health Food Evaluation of the SFDA, presented the outline of the new regulation and its objectives, as well as the new organization of the administration responsible to approve imported cosmetic products before their sale in China. He particularly emphasized the central role to be played, by the Committee of Experts charged of the technical evaluation of the application files of ""special function"" products. This committee, which will meet monthly, will consist of twenty members, and will assess the compliance of products with chemical, toxicology and labelling requirements. Its expert members are currently being recruited. On the contrary, as far as ""ordinary cosmetic"" are concerned, the appraisal of the Committee of Experts is not required. Mr. Liu Baojun, Director of the Cosmetic Division, of the Centre for Health Food Evaluation, entered more in depth into the details, and recalled the main technical requirements for the regulatory compliance of cosmetic products imported into China: testing to perform, toxicological data to provide, detection of hazardous materials, etc. Then, Ms. Françoise Yidan Li, consultant specializing in the registration of cosmetic products, proposed a very comprehensive overview of the components of a registration file, as well as the new regulatory requirements, including the approval of new ingredients. The approval of new ingredients, one of the main new items of the modified procedure, raised many questions from the audience. For the SFDA, China's regulation is clear: new ingredients are those that have not yet been marketed in China and, where appropriate, it is to the company responsible for placing the product on the market (manufacturer or supplier) to provide evidence of an earlier marketing. The administration is currently drawing up the list of substances already known in China and should publish it on its website. ""But the process is long,"" has warned Mr. Liu Baojun, who declined to give deadline for this publication. Another sticking point: the search for traces of dangerous substances, which is an important element of the new registration rules. Mr Liu Baojun recalled that according to the Chinese regulations, these substances are defined as substances that are brought by impurities in cosmetic raw materials, or through the manufacturing process, and that may pose a risk to human health. The implementation of this provision has also raised many questions as the scope of investigation seems immense while the risks are extremely low or nonexistent below a certain threshold."
"New legal conflict about the protection of the designation ""Champagne""","Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch cosmetics giant, was sentenced Friday by a court in The Hague to withdraw from sale all its shampoos ""Andrélon Champagne"" and to refrain immediately from the use the use of the denomination Champagne in its advertisements. This judgement follows a complaint from the Comité interprofessionnel du vin de Champagne (CIVC). Under the terms of the decision dated October 8: [1] ""Unilever has infringed on the denomination Champagne, which is a Protected Designation of Origin, by selling a shampoo called Champagne, as forbidden by article 118m of the Regulation 491/2009."" [2] According to the court, the use of the word champagne, as well as the multiple advertisements referring directly to the famous liquor, were a very clear breach of the European legislation, which prohibits the exploitation of ""the reputation of a designation of origin or a geographical indication."" [3] The court has therefore prohibited Unilever to continue the sale and the promotion of its shampoo, backing up its injunction by a penalty payment of 5.000 euros per day, with a maximum of 500.000 euros. According to press reports in the Netherlands, 340,000 bottles of ""Andrélon Champagne"" had been produced to mark the 70th anniversary of the Andrélon brand. This is not the first time that the use of the word champagne in the cosmetics industry raises protests from the French producers. In particular, one can remember the long legal battle who opposed the CIVC and Yves Saint Laurent after the launch of the Champagne perfume in 1993, which was eventually renamed Yvresse, after the French perfume house was sentenced for parasitism. ""This decision confirms that protected designations of origin or geographical indications names are effective legal tools to fight against some commercial uses, which can be characterized as a misappropriation of notoriety. The famous decision Comité Interprofessional du vin de Champagne vs. Société Yves Saint-Laurent, rendered by the Court of Appeal of Paris on December 15, 1993, demonstrates it perfectly,"" said Matthew Bourgeois, lawyer, and specialist in trademark law and intellectual property rights at law firm KGA. ""The EU regulation and relating case law are all the more remarkable that they can punish any use of a protected name, like Champagne, for different products, including cosmetics. """
The prohibition of samples resale is valid,"In a recent decision dated June 3, 2010 (Case C-127/09), the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in favour of Coty Prestige Lancaster Group GmbH, finding that the supply of samples to distributors did not suggest an authorisation to resell them and rejecting the ""exhaustion of rights"" theory invoked by the reseller of the samples under consideration. In this case, Coty noted that certain samples distributed to members of its distribution network had been resold to a retailer outside of the network, ""Sparfümerie"" a German company, which resold these samples to the public in Germany. The retailer claimed that Coty had agreed to the marketing of these samples when it distributed them to its distribution network and could not oppose the free distribution of the samples on the European market. This line of reasoning relies on the theory of ""exhaustion of rights"", which means that the owner of a trademark cannot prevent its use for products already introduced into the stream of commerce with its agreement in the European Union. In agreeing to this, the trademark holder would thus exhaust its rights. On the contrary, Coty denied having made any such agreement and highlighted the provisions of the distribution contract that bound the members of the authorised retail network, all of whom agreed that these samples remained the property of Coty so long as they had not been given to the consumer and that they would not resell them as well. After having been denied relief by the lower courts, the Superior Regional Tribunal of Nuremberg finally sided with Coty, finding that the contractual stipulations cited by Coty as well as the notice on the samples and their packaging (phrases like ""Demonstration"" and ""Not for Sale""), which precluded any authorisation by Coty to market the samples. The Court of Justice of the European Union was asked to respond to the following question by means of a question for preliminary ruling: ""Are goods 'put on the market' (…) if 'perfume testers' are made available to contractually-bound intermediaries without transfer of ownership and with a prohibition on sale, so that those intermediaries are able to allow potential customers to use the contents of the goods for test purposes, the goods bearing a notice stating that they may not be sold (…)?"" The Court of Justice of the European Union responded negatively, siding with Coty. It stated that the notice fixed to the samples ""clearly reflects the intention of the proprietor of the trademark concerned that the goods bearing it should not be sold"" and denied the application of the ""exhaustion of rights"" theory in this case. Going forward, practitioners should note the necessity to precisely draft contractual clauses concerning samples in selective distribution contracts involving perfume to preclude any ambiguity regarding the resale of samples without agreement of the trademark owner."
Conference to focus on cosmetics regulations in Asia,"Regulations are a major concern for companies eager to taps into the fast growing Asian cosmetics markets. Premium Beauty News is organising a one-day regulatory conference next month in Paris, focusing on China, India and the ASEAN. China is probably the main issue on the regulatory agenda of cosmetics companies today. Since the creation of the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) and the adoption of a new regulatory framework last year, the registration of new products has been partially halted. During the summer, the SFDA has published several guidelines and measures in a move to reorganise the supervision of cosmetic products in the country. For the first time in Europe, representatives of the SFDA will present and explain the organisation the Chinese administration, the aims of the new regulations, the details of the assessment procedure and how it is implemented. Mr. Huang Jiansheng, Director of the SFDA's Centre for Health Food Evaluation, and Mr. Liu Baojun, Director of the Cosmetic Division of the Centre for Health Food Evaluation will also answer questions from the participants. Practical arrangements for the registration, as well as usual errors to avoid, will be presented by Mrs Françoise Yidan Li, consultant in legislation and registration of cosmetic and health products in China. An English translation of the latest Chinese regulatory texts will also be provided to participants in the conference. While India's cosmetic market is still far from equalling its Chinese counterpart, the country is emerging as one of the fastest growing world economy. Cosmetics regulations in India are based on the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules as they were recently updated. New rules regarding the registration of cosmetic products will be enforced by April 2011. Dr. Jean Pierre Joubert, consultant and toxicologist, will provide an overview of the current legislative texts as well as market access conditions for cosmetics exporters. With a population of approximately 580 million people, 8.7% of the world population, the ten ASEAN [1] countries (Burma, Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam) refer to a common regulatory text, the so-called ASEAN Harmonized Cosmetic Regulatory Scheme, also nick-named as the ASEAN Cosmetics Directive as it is very closed from the European Union's regulatory reference. However, the implementation of this text between the different states differs widely. Mr. Emmanuel Capiomont, L'Oréal's Scientific Director Asia & Pacific will update participants on this issue.

China to put cosmetics under close surveillance,"During the summer, the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) has published several guidelines and measures strengthening the supervision of cosmetic products in China. The first series of texts - the ""Measures on Management of Health Food Evaluation Experts"" and the ""Measures on Management of Cosmetics Evaluation Experts"" - concern the administrative management of the evaluation of the cosmetic products by the authorities. At the beginning of August, the SFDA also published the ""Guidelines for routine on-site inspection to health food and cosmetics production and distribution enterprises."" This text lays down in details the procedures and methods applicable during controls performed by Chinese inspectors. Eventually, the SFDA issued a ""Guide for Risk Assessment of Possible Substances with Safety Risks in Cosmetics."" This text aims toxic substances that may be present in small quantities in cosmetic products. The text provides a definition of the concerned substances, the procedures for risk assessment and the information required in the risk assessment dossier. In September 2006, China temporarily prohibited the import and sale of some Japan's made SK-II products, a Procter & Gamble (P&G) brand, alleging they contained traces of neodymium and chromium. P&G had to discontinue the line, before going back in stores in December. In a joint statement the Ministry of Health and the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine of China agreed with P&G company officials that the product line posed no danger to human health. The next step was announced by the SFDA at the very beginning of September. A new text should finalise China's cosmetic evaluation and registration scheme. ""The SFDA had drawn up a draft plan for a product test system, was re-examining the qualifications of agencies that approve cosmetics and skin care products, and was screening candidates for a safety commission, » said a SFDA spokesperson. In order to help cosmetics companies to better understand this new legislative framework, Premium Beauty News is organising a conference on the 14th of October 2010 in Paris, with the participation of members of the SFDA who are in charge of the evaluation of cosmetic products.

Masterclass on natural and organic certifications to be held in New York,"This new Masterclass will be hosted alongside HBA Global Expo 2010. It will take place on 29-30th September at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Centre in New York City Organic Monitor has arranged the Natural Cosmetics Masterclass following the recent news that Whole Foods Market, a leading natural product retailer, will only be marketing certified organic cosmetics next year. Retailers are demanding certified products in response to consumer confusion about natural and organic beauty products. Indeed, Whole Foods Market is the latest in a number of organic and natural product retailers in the USA that already made a commitment to third party verification schemes. According to Organic Monitor this trends is similar to what happened in Europe where certification has already become a prerequisite for retailers when considering new personal care products. ""The same trend is also catching on in Asia where leading natural food retail chains such as Country Farm are increasingly seeking certified personal care products,"" adds the market research firm. With this new Masterclass, Organic Monitor intends to help companies to take the certified route. Judi Beerling, Head of Technical Research at Organic Monitor, will critically review the various natural and organic cosmetic standards in North America and other regions. This first workshop will give details of the adoption criteria in terms of permissible / prohibited ingredients, processes and formulations. The second workshop will focus on the changing competitive landscape for natural and organic cosmetic makers, with a global analysis, highlighting the major market trends and opportunities to existing participants and new entrants. Since 2008, Organic Monitor has been hosting Natural Cosmetic Masterclasses at various international locations that include London, Paris, Nuremberg and Bologna."
US cosmetics industry calls for greater FDA role,"The Personal Care Products Council (PCP), the leading trade group representing the US cosmetics industry [1], has called for a new federal legislation that would strengthen and modernize regulatory oversight of the industry and create a greater role for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in assessing ingredient safety for personal care products. The Council detailed its proposal in a letter to key health policy leaders in the Senate and House of Representatives. ""The proposal represents the culmination of more than three years of planning and research,"" said the Council in a release. ""For decades, the industry has had an impeccable safety record under the existing requirements implemented by FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Our products remain among the safest in the marketplace,"" explained Lezlee Westine, the Council's president and chief executive officer. ""Nonetheless, we believe it is time to develop a more contemporary approach that includes a greater federal regulatory role."" Westine emphasized the proactive nature of the PCPC's announcement, which is being made in the absence of any specific public health risk or legislative mandate involving personal care products, which remain safe to use. ""Rather, the industry is responding to American consumers who are requesting and deserving more transparency from government and industry while ensuring their ability to keep pace with continued demand for innovative products."" Indeed, the initiative is following recurrent polemics regarding the safety of cosmetics and their ingredients in the US. The introduction in Europe of regulatory provisions prohibiting carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic (CMR) substances in cosmetic products has also given arguments to several public action groups requiring a similar level of protection for US consumers. This even led to the adoption of a specific legislation in California [2] and several other legislative proposals in numerous other States. The Council is seeking to create formal processes for FDA to review ingredients for safety at the request of the public and stakeholder groups and to review all safety determinations made by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel. No such FDA processes currently exist. Toward that end, the PCPC has worked on a five-point plan that includes: (1) Enhanced FDA Registration. Personal care products manufacturers who market their products in the United States would be required to: – Register with FDA all facilities where those products are manufactured. – File with FDA product ingredient reports disclosing all of the ingredients used in those products; and – Report to FDA any serious unexpected adverse event with a personal care product experienced by consumers. (2) Safety levels for trace constituents. When requested or on its own initiative, FDA would be required to establish safe levels for trace constituents in cosmetic ingredients and finished products. (3) New FDA Ingredient Review Process. Once a request has been made, or FDA unilaterally determines action is warranted, the agency would be required to review the safety of any ingredient intended for use in a personal care product and set safety use levels for such ingredient on a specified timetable. This initiative could dramatically increase the list of ingredients either prohibited or limited for use in cosmetics. (4) New FDA oversight of CIR findings. The Council's initiative would maintain the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel [3], which currently assesses the safety of cosmetic ingredients, but FDA would be required to review current and future CIR findings and determine if they are correct. If there are instances in which it determines a CIR finding is not correct, FDA would determine by guidance or regulations if, or under what conditions, the ingredient can be used safely in personal care products. (5) FDA-Issued Good Manufacturing Practices. There are currently no compulsory Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) applicable to cosmetic products in the US, despite that numerous cosmetics manufacturers voluntary comply with the guidelines published by the Personal Care Products Council or other bodies. Under the Council's plan, the FDA would establish industry-wide GMP requirements. The Council and its member companies have been proactively working with legislators to materialise their plan in a bill: HR 759, the Food and Drug Administration Globalization Act of 2009, introduced by Congressman John Dingell (D-MI). ""Our companies commend Rep. Dingell for his ongoing work to better protect consumers and increase transparency. We look forward to working with the current and next Congress to ensure these changes are meaningful and attain the full force of federal law,"" said Westine."
The FEBEA reinforces its support to exporting companies,"For an exporter of cosmetic products, the Certificate of Free Sale (CFS) is a real passport, an open sesame without which it is impossible to export to some countries. Concretely, the CFS certifies that the mentioned products can be freely marketed in their country of origin, in other words, that they comply with the country regulations. It enables requesting countries to check that the product complies with regulations sometimes more stringent than in their own, and to make sur that products were not just specifically formulated for export. In France, it is the French trade association (FEBEA) that, since 1968, delivers the documents under the authority of the Ministry of Industry. This is not a unique case since, in the United States, the trade organizations also issue the CFS. The FEBEA claims having issued several hundred of thousands of these export documents to all cosmetic companies who had requested them, members or not of the trade association, while specifying that it had been done ""under such security conditions that no company had been questioned"". The procedure for issuing a CFS has nonetheless been reinforced, since the FEBEA announced that its procedures had been certified by Intertek, as complying with quality assurance standard ISO 9001:2008. Should one see in this initiative a will to stand out, while since April 2010 1st, COSMED, the other association representing the companies operating in the sector, also has a ministerial accreditation, putting an end to more than forty years of monopoly? At the FEBEA, we were told that the two facts were unrelated. ""The certification process was initiated more than a year ago"", underlines Anne Dux, Director of Scientific and Regulatory Affairs. ""The implementation work lasted a short year, it involved twelve employees, representing half of the staff of FEBEA!"". It is actually the whole chain of issuing - from the packaging audit to the checking of the INCI list - which was put under scrutiny and in line with ISO requirements. For the Febea the aim is to ensure quality in the procedure of issuing and in the service provided to businesses, but also give even more credibility to its own documents in the eyes of foreign authorities. Because, as we were explained at the FEBEA, ""in the case a problem occurs, the receiving country could be entitled to ask for some details on the procedure of issuing"". In the event of a problem which could be for example an accident with a non-complying product to Franco-European regulations but yet displaying its CFS. With 18,000 to 20,000 CFS issued annually, the need to consolidate the procedure of issuing seemed logical. ""And this will have no impact on the cost of the document issuing,"" said the FEBEA. The Certificate of Free Sale is currently required for export in some sixty countries, including heavyweights like as China, India, Russia, South Korea, and Brazil."
US retailer to require third-party certification of personal care products,"By next year, Whole Foods Market, the US leading retailer of certified organic groceries, will require all personal care products making ""organic"" claims to get a third-party certification before being sold in its US stores. The new requirements apply to all personal care products and cosmetics using the word ""organic"" in any way on the product label, including the use of the word ""organic"" in the brand name. However, Whole Foods Market will not accept all third-parties certifications. Depending on the type of claims, different certifications are required: – All products making an ""organic"" product claim (e.g. ""organic shampoo"") will have to be certified tothe United States Department of Agriculture National Organic Program (USDA NOP) standard, the same standard to which organic food must be certified under U.S. law. These products must contain more than 95% organic ingredients. – Products making a ""made with organic ingredients"" claim must also be certified to the NOP standard. These products must contain more than 70% organic ingredients. – And products making a ""contains organic ingredients"" claim must be certified to the NSF 305 ANSI Standard for Organic Personal Care products, a consensus-based industry standard accepted by the American National Standards Institute and managed by NSF International. This choice is highly demanding since the NOP standard was developed for farmed foods, with no consideration for the specificities of cosmetic products. According to Whole Foods Market, this decision aims at ensuring that claims on product labels are accurate. ""Our shoppers do not expect the definition of organic to change substantially between the food and non-food aisles of our stores,"" said Joe Dickson, quality standards coordinator for Whole Foods Market. ""We believe that the 'organic' claim used on personal care products should have just as strong a meaning to the 'organic' claim used on food products, which is currently regulated by the USDA's National Organic Program."" Whole Foods Market said to be currently working with suppliers to transition their label claims to the meet these standards. The company said that ""quite a few"" of its suppliers will have ""change their labels, reformulate their products and take other measures"" to comply with this new rules."
Cosmetics firms accused of price fixing in Switzerland,"After a 18-month investigation regarding, in particular, the activities of the Association of manufacturers, importers and suppliers of cosmetics and perfumery (ASCOPA), the Permanent Secretariat of the Competition Commission (COMCO) has requested sanctions against several companies in the perfumes and cosmetics industry. ASCOPA's membership consists mainly in high-end brands from the selective distribution channel. L'Oreal Produits de Luxe Suisse, Chanel, Clarins, Parfums Christian Dior and YSL Beauté, are among the companies concerned by this request. The Secretariat of the COMCO, which conducts investigations and prepares the Commission's decisions, is accusing ASCOPA member companies of ""illegal agreements on prices and quantities."" The Secretariat claims to have accumulated ""increasingly obvious evidences that ""that the companies concerned were able to harmonize their prices and protect their market share thanks to information exchanges"". L'Oreal's Swiss subsidiary has denied any violation of the competition laws in Switzerland and said it would respond to the COMCO Secretariat allegations as soon as it will be notified the details as the procedure provides. The proposed fines are calculated based on each company's turnover and depend on the severity of the violation. They can range from 17,000 to 25.5 million Swiss francs. The Competition Commission will adopt a final decision on the basis of the Secretariat's report, comments received from concerned firms, as well as on possible hearings."
Health Canada endorses the ISO GMP standard,"In order help cosmetics makers to meet Canadian safety and quality requirements regarding cosmetics, Health Canada has just endorsed the use of the ISO standard 22716 on good manufacturing practices for cosmetics. Heath Canada reminds that the Food and Drugs Act prohibits the sale of cosmetics that are manufactured, prepared, preserved, packaged or stored under unsanitary conditions, that may cause injury to the health of the user, or that consist of any filthy or decomposed substance or any foreign matter. Under the Act, ""unsanitary"" means: ""such conditions or circumstances as might contaminate with dirt or filth, or render injurious to health, a food, drug or cosmetic."" The Canadian health administration encourages all cosmetic manufacturers to adhere to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs). These guidelines are used to ensure product quality control and an effective approach to risk management. They set out standards for product manufacturing, testing, storage, handling and distribution, to ensure that each step of manufacturing is acceptable for quality and safety of the product. ""GMPs do not provide specifics on how products are to be manufactured. Instead they outline the expected outcome of the processes. Each manufacturer, large or small, may have a unique means of achieving these outcomes,"" says Health Canada."
Safety of cosmetics for babies: French health agency publishes its recommendations,"Along with the campaigns of inspections and controls conducted in 2009 on products for children under three years of age, the French Agency for the Safety of Health Products (AFSSAPS) has established a multidisciplinary working group regarding the safety evaluation of these products and the characteristics that need to be taken into account in assessing the safety for this age population. The recommendations of the working group have just been published and are about to be forwarded to the European authority for a better harmonization of regulatory requirements within the EU. According to AFSSAPS, the safety assessment of cosmetic products intended for children under 3 years of age must take into account: – the fact that, proportionally to their mass, the body surface of children of 0-3 years is more important than that of adults and that functional maturity of the metabolic systems may not be stabilized before 2 years of age, – certain specific conditions of exposure, especially at the level of the seat area, which is highly exposed, – the different types of products, especially not-rinsed products that can be applied several times a day with no limit. For rinsed off products, a retention factor of 10% was also adopted for the calculation of safety margins, where the manufacturer did not measure the actual effectiveness of flushing. Regarding the formulation of cosmetic products for children under 3 years of age, theFrench health agency recommends: – using the lowest number of ingredients and choosing those for which the toxicity profile is well known and with a history use sufficient to ensure safety; – distributing required toxicological data according to identified risk factors (area of application and / or product categories [rinsed off / non rinsed]). As far as the safety assessment of finished products, is concerned, the AFSSAPS recommends: – paying attention to the safety of primary packaging and to the opening and closing systems, as well as the physico-chemical and microbiological characteristics of the products, – performing clinical trials on adults in order to assess skin tolerance and acceptability of the finished product, with the aim to extrapolate results to children under 3 years of age. Eventually, the Agency recommends not using cosmetics on premature babies as long as they are in a neonatology service.

Algeria tightens the conditions for cosmetic imports,"Algerian authorities have decided to strengthen the control of cosmetic products marketed in their country. A decree of the Ministry of Commerce imposes new conditions for the importation, sale and manufacture of cosmetics and personal hygiene products in Algeria [1]. According to this text, published April 21st in the Official Journal, producers and importers will now have to seek authorization from the Ministry of Commerce, prior to marketing any new product. They will have to submit a dossier containing a dozen pieces, including: – name and designation of the product, – relevant precautions and instructions or information for use, – indications on the qualitative composition of the product as well as the analytical quality of raw materials involved, – results of analysis and tests conducted on the raw materials and finished products, – results of tests and methods implemented regarding, in particular, the degree of skin toxicity, transcutaneous or mucosal, – method of identification of batches, model and / or a draft of the labelling, – name, position and professional qualifications of the individual or individuals in charge of the manufacturing, packaging or importation and compliance checks. This permit is issued upon ""opinion of the Scientific and Technical Committee of the Algerian Agency for the control of quality and packaging"", with the selected criteria not being specified in the text. Also according to the decree, the Ministry of Commerce has a delay of 45 days upon the date of receipt for filing the application for authorization, to grant or deny permission for marketing. The publication of this text was expected since the Algerian press had reported the will of the Government to cut down the import bill of cosmetics, but also foster the development of local supply.

Commission warns Sweden to comply with EU rules on cosmetics,"The European Commission says Sweden is infringing EU law on cosmetic products (Directive 76/768/EEC and its amendments) by imposing excessive requirements in the notification process. ""The Cosmetics Directive establishes rules to be complied with by any cosmetic product made available on the market, in order to ensure the functioning of the internal market and a high level of protection of human health. The directive provides exhaustively for the harmonisation of national rules on the placing on the market of cosmetics including their packaging and labelling. Member States may not adopt national rules that exceed these requirements in this respect,"" the Commission explains. Actually, the current Swedish law on cosmetics and hygiene products contains several requirements that go beyond what is required by the Cosmetics Directive, including: – notification of products already notified in another Member State; – more information than required for market surveillance purposes which is limited to the address of the place of manufacture of the cosmetic products, or of their initial importation into the Community. According to the Commission, Sweden's stringent requirements may hinder the functioning of the European internal market. Therefore, the sending of the Commission's Reasoned Opinion is the final stage before launching a legal action. Should Sweden decide to ignore the Commission's opinion, the case would be referred to the European Court of Justice. Excessive requirements introduced into national laws during the transposition process of European rules are a frequent source of litigation against EU Member States. Slighter legal variations from one country to another are also regarded a source of unnecessary complexity. To address the issues, the European Union voted a new Cosmetic Products Regulation, (EU Regulation 1223/2009), that will replace the current Cosmetics Directive from 11 July 2013. The provisions of this new regulation will be directly applicable and will not required to be transposed into Member States' laws thus limiting risks of infringement."
Certification of organic and natural cosmetic products in Europe: how to find one's way,"At first, Laurence Mulon [1], reminds us that the first natural cosmetics were made in Germany in the 1920s ..., with Weleda in 1922 and Dr. Haushka (Wala) in 1929. While the first French brands only appeared in 1972 with Phyt's and Paltz in 1976. And it's only as of 2005, with the help of several media events, that bio cosmetics emerged from their elitist retail channels to conquer other markets. ""Of course, it became necessary, considering, during all these years the profusion of emerging labels, to organize all these initiatives. Thus, the creation in 2003, of a European group of harmonization between six national organizations resulted, late 2009, in the publication of the Cosmos Standard. In addition, a European label, NaTrue, was created by several German manufacturers and published in 2008,"" she underlines, ""Globally"", explains Laurence Mulon, ""as far as Cosmos is concerned, the indication of bio value corresponds to the bio plant introduced (plant water included). The ratio plant/extract or plant/final product must be considered. A number of ingredients will be concerned during a transitional period of three to five years… But some questions remain unresolved, such as the one on the choice of the logo…The novelty lies in the introduction of the 12 principles of green chemistry…"". Packaging are of course subject to a special status. ""Primary and secondary packaging"" she explains ""must be designed to minimize direct and indirect impacts on the environment during their whole life cycle"". She also underlines, ""the relevance of using cases, unit-doses or wet wipes should be reassessed"" and she adds, ""that plans should be made to have evidence provided during the certification stage of each element of the packaging,"" bearing in mind that ""some materials are prohibited, such as PVC-based plastics and their derivatives, polystyrene and any materials containing constituents derived from GMOs, biodegradable plastics based on corn starch ..."" ""The label offers three level of certification"", explains Laurence Mulon, (natural cosmetics, partly organic natural cosmetics, organic cosmetics), ""but importantly the label presents a novelty by introducing the concept of product categories (13 categories have been defined) inside of which are defined specific certifications criteria"". Currently 282 cosmetic products are certified. The certified companies are essentially German. ""The label emphasizes on limiting packaging to favor recyclable packaging or packaging made of renewable materials"", she underlines, ""and products must be designed for multiple use purpose (except samples)."" Eventually pressurized gas containers are not certifiable."
Nanoproducts: France recommends the precautionary principle,"Several studies suggest that some products containing nanomaterials may present risks to health and environment. It is in any case the conclusion of the French Agency for Environmental and Occupational Health Safety (Afsset), who just published the results of a collective expertise on risk assessment on nanomaterials for general population and the environment. Afsset found several hundred consumer products containing nanomaterials (cosmetics, textiles, food, sports gear, construction materials), for which the agency notes ""a context of scientific uncertainty"". The agency underlines that consumer exposure to manufactured nanomaterials and the environmental dispersion resulting from their consumption, prove ""to be extremely complex to evaluate, both qualitatively and quantitatively"", particularly because of the low traceability of nanomaterials in products intended for consumption. As for studies on risks to health and environment, they represent only 2% of published studies on nanomaterials, and are often affected by many biases (absent or incomplete characterization of nanomaterials, studies conducted on synthetic molecules not deriving from finished products, studies on far higher doses than actual exposure, etc..). In an attempt to better assess the extent of risks Afsset selected and analyzed four types of products incorporating nanoparticles: antibacterial socks (silver nanoparticles), self-cleaning cement, sunscreen (nanoparticles of titanium dioxide), and sugar powder (food nanosilice). These products are widely used and representative of different routes for direct exposure (dermal, by inhalation or by ingestion), but Afsset said that in this area, ""findings of a study conducted on a specific case cannot in any case be generalized or extrapolated to another product in the same category"". Regarding sunscreens, the agency notes that if, until very recently, various studies showed that there was no passage of nanoparticles of titanium dioxide (TiO2) through the skin barrier, "" results of some more recent studies show, on the contrary, the existence of a skin passage and the possibility for these TiO2 nanoparticles to be found in the deep layer of the epidermis"". Afsset considers that the risk to human health cannot be excluded for sunscreens containing TiO2, ""given the uncertainties on the potential for skin penetration and phototoxic activity"". With regard to ecotoxicity, no consistent data is really available. Given this uncertainty, on behalf of the precautionary principle, Afsset recommends acting without delay. The agency thus recommends: – making nanomaterials traceability mandatory, which requires a compulsory declaration from the actors in the industry, – implementation of clear labelling mentioning the presence of nanomaterials in products and informing on the possibility of release during usage, – going as far as prohibiting certain uses of nanomaterials for which the usefulness is low compared to potential hazards, at a press conference, Martin Guespereau, Afsset's Director for instance, declared he was in favor of banning antibacterial socks, given the potential risk and low social utility, – harmonizing French and European regulations to apply the best practices, especially with a revision of REACH in order to take into account specifically manufactured nanomaterials regardless of tonnage. From this point of view, regulations concerning cosmetics anticipates several points. The new Regulation (EC) N° 1223/2009 of 30 November 2009 provides notification and assessment of the safety of cosmetic products containing nanomaterials (applicable from January first, 2013) and indication of nanomaterials in the list of ingredients. Moreover, given the urgency to progress on the knowledge concerning exposures and potential hazards of nanomaterials, Afsset also makes recommendations for elaborating a revised approach on health risk assessment that is appropriate to nanomaterials specificities."
France: new rules for advertising on cosmetics,"""The updating of this rule (formerly known as ""Health & Beauty"") responds to a need to adapt to some changes that have appeared in the advertising discourse specific to the sector, but also to marketing and scientific developments that characterize the new products which are precisely promoted by the ads"", says the ARPP (previously named BVP) in a statement. As the procedure requires, the initial draft was submitted to the Joint Council for Advertising (Conseil Paritaire de la Publicité) - composed equally of representatives from NGO (consumer and environment) and advertising professionals. In its opinion, the Council has placed particular emphasis on issues such as the statistical significance of samples used for surveys or refering, in advertising, to techniques such as facelifts, as well as refering to ARPP's new Code of Sustainable Development for all entries related to environmental protection. According to the ARPP, the new Code of ethics has taken into consideration all of its recommendations. Among the important points introduced by the new Code: – Presentation of performances including figures: Beyond clear display concerning the nature of tests carried out (clinical or customer satisfaction), sample size and average scores on the general population, new rules set limits for any further presentation of more typical results on a smaller proportion of the sample ; – Use of allegations such as ""without"" / ""free"": Such allegation can only be used, provided it is presented in a positive way and only aiming to be informative. Hence, professionals want to avoid proliferation of claims such as ""without parabens"", ""without preservatives"", ""phthalates free"", which could give way to stronger consumer suspicion towards a number of substances, even though they admit there are real expectations from a ""growing part of the public"" for such information; – Products claimed as ""organic"" or ""natural"": A cosmetic product can only be described as ""natural"" if the final product contains a minimum of 95 percent of ingredients identified as ""natural"" or ""of natural origin"", and it can only be described as ""organic"" if it contains 100 percent of ingredients derived from certified organic farming and / or if it has been certified ""organic"" by a certification body and / or if it can be proven that it was developed according to published specifications equivalent to those of acknowledged certification bodies. New advertisements will have to comply with these new rules as of March 1st, 2010. All ads are concerned, regardless of the broadcast medium used.

France: getting ready to display environmental information for cosmetic products,"Lagging behind on the subject, for a long time, when compared to a number of its European neighbors, France has chosen to work extra hard on environmental protection. The country's aim? Get through sustainable growth and green economy within thirty years. In a country where all political sides have long viewed what directly or indirectly looked like an ecologist with the mocking eye lent to dreamers and lunatics, such a conversion cannot be achieved without difficulties or tensions. Yet, two years ago, the country undertook a huge project to ""turn greener"" all of its public policies: the ""Grenelle Environnement"". Environmental information of consumer products, one of the consequences of this new policy, was one of the issues to be debated at the last breakfast organized, on December 17th in Paris, by the BeautyFULL Club, an association of professionals in the beauty industry. Hervé Rebollo, Director of Economic and International Affairs at the French Federation of Beauty Companies (Fédération des entreprises de la beauté, FEBEA), has reviewed for us the situation concerning the different projects and how they could affect the cosmetics industry. ""This request is a ground swell initiated by the public opinion, explains Hervé Rebollo, it is relayed by politicians, eco friendly personalities, NGOs, consumer associations, and by professionals."" For him, no doubt about it, ""you may have your own opinion about this request but it's impossible to go against it."" Especially now that it is backed up by a law. The law called ""Grenelle 1"", passed in the wake of discussions held at the ""Grenelle Environnement"" stipulates that: ""Consumers must have access to sincere, objective and comprehensive environmental information, on the global characteristics of the pair product / packaging ( ...). Information about environmental impacts of products (...) will be progressively developed."" [1] There is a second law, known as ""Grenelle 2,"" a law which is still under consideration by Parliament, which sets the deadline, stating that consumer information should begin gradually – this point is important, it is not a big bang that is expected, but a gradual onset – as of January 1st, 2011. The goal is very ambitious given the practical difficulties and the financial magnitude of the project. It is also the Grenelle 2 bill which specifies the nature of this environmental labeling. It should refer to ""the equivalent carbon content of products and their packaging, as well as the consumption of natural resources or the impact on natural environments which are attributable to these products during their lifecycle"". The method of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), as defined by ISO [2], is at the heart of the project. For practical purposes, the ADEME [3] and the AFNOR [4] were entrusted the task of proposing a method to achieve this information display. A referencing system of best practices [5] was published in October, but it is only a general method, which must be amended with proposals from sectorial workgroups. ""And we are monitoring this issue closely since we are in charge of the secretarial work of the workgroup 4B, dedicated to cosmetic products and beauty industry,"" underlines Hervé Rebollo. Of course, all this has a cost. To achieve an LCA is not easy and companies will have to mobilize important human and financial resources. The difficulty is also more important for SMEs, which have fewer resources than large groups, which will have to process thousands of references. ""And this does not only concern manufacturers of finished products,"" warns Hervé Rebollo. ""Suppliers will have to participate by providing their clients with the information they need."" And apparently, no subsidy is to be hoped for. The workgroup for cosmetics chose to test the method on shampoos. According to Hervé Rebollo, ""this is actually the best selling item, all networks considered after shower gels"". This guarantees a good visibility of the new information when it is achieved. And shampoos are also the items ""for which there is the most available data, and also they are rinsed products and the issue concerning the impact of our products on aquatic environments is to be considered"". Work is underway, data has been collected from industrials ""and we should very quickly see the outcome"". Note that the use phase is to be taken into consideration: for instance, the energy needed to heat the water during a shampoo has a signficant impact on the results. However, for the time being, the comings and goings of consumers to the stores have not been taken into account in the method used for analysis. Many issues need to be clarified, including the practical details concerning the information to consumers: labelling or posting on the point of sale, or both of them? The question of the inclusion of this French requirement in the European context is also unsolved. For companies in any case, ""the subject should be at the heart of concerns for the 10 or 15 years to come."""
Canada: antiperspirants reclassified as cosmetic products,"The decision to reclassify antiperspirants was adopted this spring following a detailed review of the claims, directions for use, composition and presentation of products currently marketed in Canada. As a consequence, Health Canada's Cosmetic Division is now accepting Cosmetic Notification Forms for antiperspirants. Notification to Health Canada is mandatory for all cosmetic products sold in Canada. Aluminum-based antiperspirants must therefore comply to the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, Cosmetic Regulations, and other Canadian legislation applicable to cosmetics. It is the responsibility of the manufacturer/importer to ensure that a cosmetic product placed on the Canadian market is in compliance with all relevant regulatory requirements. The quantity of ingredient(s) in the product must also comply with the limits outlined in the classification document entitled Product Assessment Against Criteria: Antiperspirants, and/or the Cosmetic Ingredient Hotlist. Products claiming treatment of hyperhydrosis or extended duration of effect based on modification of organic function are considered drugs under the Food and Drugs Act. They are then considered to be subject to the Food and Drug Regulations or the Natural Health Products Regulations (NHPR) depending on the active ingredient. Any product making such claims may submit an application with supporting data to the Health Products and Food Branch for assessment. Accordingly, Health Canada has listed acceptable and unacceptable claims for cosmetic antiperspirants. Acceptable: – Antiperspirant – Reduces (or provides protection against) underarm perspiration – Reduces (or provides protection against) underarm perspiration due to stress – Protects against wetness – 24 hour antiperspirant effect – Extra effective Unacceptable : – Antiperspirant for hyperhydrosis/problem perspiration – Persistent protection (i.e. persistent protection, usually significantly greater than 24 hours, based on a mechanism of action that modifies organic function) – Stops or prevents perspiration – Helps check, halt or stop underarm wetness, dampness or perspiration – Helps keep you dry In the United States, antiperspirants are classified as drugs. In New Zealand, Australia, and the European Union, they are cosmetics."
The Paris City Council warns people about skin-whitening products,"The Paris City Council wishes to warn people concerned, mostly women, of the dangers of whitening dark skins and especially from the use of some products, illegal or diverted from their original use. The campaign includes a serie of poster displays, an educational comic strip entitled Ebony Beauty and an educational booklet on the dangers of lightening creams. It is mainly focused on the Parisian districts mostly affected by this phenomenon (eighteenth, nineteenth and tenth districts). The Paris City Council evaluates that about 20% of women of African origin living in the French capital use lightening products, a number of them containing hydroquinone and topical corticosteroids the use of which, for such purposes, is prohibited in cosmetics. Several police operations aiming to dismantle networks importing and distributing illegal products have already been conducted in Paris in previous years. However, the demand for these creams remains high among women who consider they are more efficient than legal products. The French Federation of Beauty Enterprises (FEBEA), which includes major French manufacturers of cosmetic products has endeavored to point out that this issue was related to the use of illegal products, which consumers often buy on the internet and that safe solutions were available. Such products meant to whiten or lighten the skin are widely used in Africa, India and Asia, and in communities originally from these countries, established in Europe. In India, their use has recently been condemned by some politicians and members of Parliament."
Cosmetics for babies: French authorities want a more accurate assessment,"The General Directorate for Competition Policy, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF) and the French Agency for the Medical Safety of Health Products (AFSSAPS) found that cosmetic products marketed for babies in France complied with standards, i.e. regarding their composition, their microbiological quality, labeling and content of the regulatory file. ""The compliance rate for samples tested is even high when compared to results usually observed for cosmetic products for adults"", they note in their report. Since last fall, the two administrations in charge of the control of the French market have processed to a total of 32 inspections, including among the suppliers of advertising boxes distributed by maternities, under suspicion since last year by the Committee on Sustainable Development in Health (C2DS). French authorities have also analyzed 79 cosmetic products for children under 3 years of age. ""Our overall assessment of the products tested is good,"" said on her side Nathalie Homobono, General Manager of DGCCRF. In spite of this favorable report, Afssaps and DGCCRF pinpoint ""some deficiencies regarding the quality of documents provided in support of the specific assessment on the safety of these products"". Current regulation in Europe compels manufacturers of cosmetic products for children under three years of age to make a specific assessment regarding the safety of products, but it does not specify the particular tests to be performed. On a total of 47 products tested, no assessment was found for 3 products marketed by the same company and 44 evaluations were considered perfectible (that is 93%) by Afssaps. The companies concerned have positively modified the quality of assessment certificates, but the DGCCRF and Afssaps consider that at this stage, actual improvements cannot be considered sufficient. A draft of recommendations has been developed by a working group under the responsibility of Afssaps. This document is currently under public consultation and should be completed by the end of this year. Its purpose is to provide operators with guidelines that may enable them to improve the quality of their evaluations. Finally, French authorities have indicated their will to maintain, as part of their inspections, particular vigilance on cosmetic products intended for children under three years of age. France will submit the results of its findings to other countries in the European Union to call their attention on the need to strengthen controls on these products in the European market and to harmonize the methods of safety assessment."
"""It is necessary to rationalize raw materials in the catalogue"", Dr Sylvain-Romain Cotte, regulatory expert","Premium Beauty News - What are the areas where you bring your contribution the most? Sylvain-Romain Cotte - After having spent many years in the industry, I created my company, at a time when regulations on cosmetic products were becoming considerably more complex in Europe. On the one hand, the ban on animal testing had been planned and secondly, authorities were setting very ambitious standards in terms of safety and scientific knowledge regarding substances used by manufacturers, in particular with the adoption of REACH. In co-operation with the French Federation of Beauty Enterprises (FEBEA), I assisted the first French companies who initiated audits to test the compliance of their manufacturer premises with Cosmetics Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) [1]. Needless to say that for SRC Consulting, work was plentiful. We operate in areas as diverse as: – organization, by audits of organization for regulatory affairs, – compliance with French and European regulations (audit, setting-up and management of European legal records on products, assessment on product safety for human health, regulatory validation of communication media and advertisement), – support for the launch of products on overseas markets, – Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) for Cosmetics (audit of industrial sites with regard to GMP Cosmetics, accompanying the action plan for compliance), – regulatory watch (setting-up of a customized regulatory watch, …), – training (in a number of schools and universities and through in-house training). Premium Beauty News - In this increasingly complex regulatory framework, what are the main difficulties encountered by companies in the cosmetics industry? Sylvain-Romain Cotte - Strangely enough, in a world where information sources are more and more available, I feel that the biggest difficulty is finding the right piece of technical information and, above all, to be able to transpose it into industrial practice. Hence the need to get support from experts, but here again, it is not easy to be accompanied by the proper consultants, the ones that have the ""industrial reflex"" that is to say the knowledge of the operational capability of the company. Then I think the final difficulty is to analyze and assess the risks of regulatory non-compliances to make the proper decisions. Premium Beauty News - What are the regulatory ""emergencies"" of the moment? Sylvain-Romain Cotte - As far as France is concerned, undoubtedly the implementation of GMP for Cosmetics. The ""Made in France"" must be the benchmark for quality in the cosmetics and perfumes industry worldwide. Then, information and application of the new European Regulation on Cosmetics, and eventually the regulatory watch on ingredients and data computerization. Regarding GMP, operators are now at the budgeting stage, either as manufacturers, for the implementation of the text and to obtain the certification, either as brand owners, to delegate outsourced audits. Premium Beauty News - What will the entry into force of the European regulation change? Sylvain-Romain Cotte - It will first help clarifying responsibilities of the different actors in the sector, what is going to change in their relationship. It will often involve a new organization of companies in terms of setting-up and management of European legal records. It also changes the assessment of the product safety. Eventually, it will, in my opinion, encourage in some cases a rationalization of raw materials in the catalogue! Premium Beauty News - You are launching next month in Paris, Les Matinales de la cosmétique ™ (The Mornings of Cosmetics), can you tell us more? Sylvain-Romain Cotte - In a fairly difficult economical situation, I wanted to create a new concept in professional meetings, both friendly, relevant, operational, effective and economic on highly specific topics related to the cosmetic industry. The number of participants is intentionally limited in order to stimulate discussions. The themes addressed will not only be on regulatory issues, they will also concern subjects related to other issues such as markets, distribution, sustainable development, etc.. with each time, participation of key experts. The frequency of Les Matinales de la Cosmétique™ will depend on the needs of professionals, they will probably occur on a monthly basis. The first meeting on Tuesday November 17, 2009, will specifically focus on the theme: ""European Cosmetic Regulations: The obligations of the liable person"". I therefore invite all interested professionals to join me at 14 Avenue Georges Mandel - 75116 Paris (Metro Trocadero) from 8.00 sharp (opening at 7:30 am) to 9:45. The participation fee is 50 € per person. And do remember that seating is limited to 15 attendees. For more information: contact@src-consulting.fr For this first event, I will moderate the meeting with the participation of a surprise speaker, a manufacturer from a prestigious French cosmetic company. The second event, is scheduled on December 15, 2009, on a very operational issue too."
Health Canada publishes new cosmetic ingredient hotlist,"Health Canada has revised its hotlist of cosmetic ingredients. The September 2009 Cosmetic Ingredient Hotlist replaces the March 2007 version. Several entries were modified, mostly for clarification, and five entries were added: – Cyanoacrylate-based adhesives. This ingredient has been added as a restriction due to safety concerns with products with quick skin bonding properties. – Diethylene glycol (DEG) (111-46-6). This ingredient has been added as a restriction due to toxicity concerns. – Diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) (117-81-7). This ingredient has been added as a prohibition to reflect a declaration of 'toxic' under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act due to health concerns. – Glycerin (56-81-5). This ingredient has been added as a restriction due to possible contamination of diethylene glycol (DEG) in glycerin. – 1-Naphthol (90-15-3), and its salts. This ingredient has been added as a restriction due to risk of sensitization. Health Canada has developed the hotlist - a list of substances that are restricted and prohibited in cosmetics to help cosmetic manufacturers satisfy the requirements for sale of a cosmetic. The hotlist is reviewed and updated a few times per year as new scientific data becomes available. Click on the image here below to retrieve the September 2009 Hotlist:"
FDA study: lead level in lipsticks not a safety concern,"After a report released in October 2007 by the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics (CSC), an advocacy group coalizing nonprofit health and environmental organizations, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decided that further follow-up of lead in lipstick was needed. In order to ensure the safety of cosmetic products, FDA scientists have developed and validated a method for determining total lead content in lipstick using microwave-assisted digestion and analysis employing inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). This new FDA method is highly sensitive, with a detection limit estimated to be 0.04 parts per million (ppm). ""In conducting their study, FDA applied a method that determines the total lead content of each of the products tested, not the amount of lead to which a consumer who used the product would have been exposed. This rigorous method destroys the entire product and releases all of the lead present in the product for analysis,"" commented the Personal Care Products Council, which represents the cosmetic and personal care products industry. The FDA applied its method to the same selection of lipsticks evaluated by the CSC and found lead in all of the lipsticks tested, ranging from 0.09 ppm to 3.06 ppm with an average value of 0.97 ppm [1] , significantly higher than the highest lead level of 0.65 reported in the 2007 CSC study. However, FDA does not consider the lead levels that it found in the lipsticks to be a safety concern. ""The lead levels found are within the range that would be expected from lipsticks formulated with permitted colour additives and other ingredients that had been prepared under good manufacturing practice conditions"". The agency adds that acceptable levels of lead in lipsticks cannot be compared to those settled for food products as ""lipstick is a product intended for topical use, and is only ingested incidentally and in very small quantities"". The Personal Care Products Council agreed. Lead levels detected in lipsticks are ""safe and well below limits recommended by international regulatory and public health authorities,"" the Council said in a statement. ""Consumers who use lipstick ingest only a tiny fraction of the lipstick they apply, and much of the lead that is ingested in that tiny fraction of lipstick is not biologically available because it is trapped inside larger particles and excreted by the body"". Dr. Sean Palfrey, a professor of pediatrics and public health at Boston University School of Medicine and medical director of Boston's Lead Poisoning Prevention Program, agreed that the levels are still low, but wondered if they could build up to more toxic amounts, especially in foetuses and children. The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics called on the FDA to ""immediately set standards to require manufacturers to minimize lead in lipstick to the lowest achievable levels."""
REACH may require much more animals and funds than anticipated,"""As toxicologists, we support the aims of REACH - it is the biggest investment into consumer safety ever. However, we feel that legislators have underestimated the scale of the challenge,"" say Thomas Hartung [1] and Constanza Rovida [2] the authors of a study funded by the Trans-Atlantic Think Tank for Toxicology at John Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, and commented in the August 26 edition of Nature. The full analysis appears as an electronic prepublication of the September 2009 edition of the journal ALTEX, Alternatives to Animal Experimentation. Hartung and Costanza have calculated that REACH may require 54 million research animals and EUR 9.5 billion (USD 13.4 billion) over the next 10 years, which represents 20 times the number of animals and 6 times the cost anticipated in previous estimates. Currently, the EU uses approximately 900,000 animals at a cost of EUR 600 million (USD 847 million) per year to evaluate new chemicals, drugs, pesticides and food additives. When REACH was voted, it was expected that 27,000 companies would submit 180,000 pre-registrations on 29,000 substances. Instead, some 65,000 companies made more than 2.7 million pre-registrations for in excess of 140,000 substances. REACH aims to complete data collection on these substances by 2018. However, in recent decades Europe has tested some 200-300 new chemicals each year, making REACH an unprecedented challenge. ""Toxicologists do not have the appropriate tools to meet these expectations,"" claim the authors of the study. According to them, 90 percent of the projected animal use and 70 percent of the projected cost would come from research into reproductive toxicity testing. ""A revision of test approaches especially for reproductive toxicity is essential. There is no alternative to REACH, but there will be no REACH without alternatives,"" says Hartung. ""Clearly, the exact numbers will only be known once all the registrations are submitted and testing proposals are received, but, based on the information that we have and our discussions with industry, the numbers provided in this study are thankfully very wide of the mark,"" commented Geert Dancet, Executive Director of ECHA, the European Chemicals Agency. According to ECHA, Hartung and Costanza's study overestimates three things: the likely number of substances that will be registered under REACH and requiring a full data set, the likely number of tests and laboratory animals required, and the likely costs for conducting the tests. ""The original estimates on the number of animals still hold,"" concludes ECHA, that is to say that 9 million laboratory animals would be involved in the tests required and that the costs for conducting the tests would amount to 1.3 billion euros."
SGS to certify compliance with the EFfCI's GMP guidelines,"The set of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines developed by the European Federation for Cosmetic Ingredients (EFfCI) are designed to help both EFfCI members, and others within the industry, to minimise or eliminate incidents of contaminations, mix-ups and other errors by controlling all the components that can affect product quality. EFfCI has entered a long-term agreement with SGS, so as the inspection, testing and certification company will offer the possibility of GMP certification, based on EFfCI's GMP guidelines, to the members of EFfCI as well as to non-members who want to manage and improve the quality and safety of their cosmetics products."
What standard for natural and organic cosmetic products?,"After six years of intensive work and an international public consultation of three months, the European Cosmetics Standards Working Group has released the final outcome with the publication of Cosmos-standard, which harmonises the minimum requirements for organic and natural cosmetics of Europe's leading certifications bodies: Soil Association (UK), BDiH (Germany), Cosmebio and Ecocert (France), ICEA (Italy) and Ecogarantie (Belgium). Combined, these agencies provide certification to about 1,000 cosmetic companies and 10,000 products Certification of the new Cosmos standard is expected to begin in September 2009, once the agencies will have harmonized the key points of the subsequent control plan. The objective of this new Standard is ambitious and goes beyond the harmonization of European rules as concerned certification bodies clearly show their ambition to go further with the setting of an internationally accepted standard for organic and natural cosmetics. ""Other certification/inspection bodies that are not members of the group will have the possibility to apply to use this Standard. The procedure for application and authorisation will be opened as from September 30th, 2009"" explains Francis Blake of Soil Association. However, according to Organic Monitor, a market research agency specialising on natural and organic products, ""Cosmos is losing impetus because of its lengthy gestation period. A number of new initiatives, introduced in the last 18 months, are gaining momentum and could outpace Cosmos"". Organic Monitor says that the NaTrue certification, which was launched in May 2008, with the first certified products coming into the market at the end of the year, is growing in popularity, ""partly because it is backed by some of the leading brands of natural cosmetics in Europe"". Furthermore, a number of developments are occurring in the USA, where three separate initiatives are now moving forward with the backing of large cosmetic manufacturers. The frontrunner is Natural Products Association (NPA), which launched its natural standard in May 2008. Over 200 products are now certified according to the NPA standard. Burt's Bees is one of the main supporters of the NPA standard, providing US $1 million to raise awareness of the new standard and NPA logo. The National Science Foundation (NSF) standard is expected to gain popularity. The NSF 305 standard is for cosmetic products that contain a minimum of 70% organic ingredients. Developed by leading organic cosmetic companies, it has recently received official recognition by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). The main rival to the NSF 305 standard is OASIS, supported by large companies like Aveda and Hain Celestial. Organic Monitor also notes that similar developments are occurring in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific where a number of private standards have been introduced. Organic Monitor expects standards that provide regional coverage to be the most successful. The company considers that NaTrue is winning support because of its uniform labelling scheme, while Cosmos will not replace any of the existing symbols and logos. ""For this reason, initial interest in Cosmos is expected to mainly come from companies who already have products certified by Cosmos member organisations,"" says Organic Monitor. The NaTrue standard is also taking the lead for a possible global natural and organic cosmetics standard. It has already entered an equivalency agreement with NSF for its made with organic ingredients standard. A similar equivalency agreement with NPA for the natural standard is scheduled to be signed in July."
FDA warns consumers on bacterial contamination risk in skin products,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced yesterday (June 08, 2009) that Clarcon Biological Chemistry Laboratory Inc., a skin care manufacturer headquartered in Roy, Utah, is voluntarily recalling some skin sanitizers and skin protectants marketed under several different brand names because of high levels of disease-causing bacteria found in the products. The contamination was revealed during a recent FDA's inspection of the Clarcon facility. ""Analyses of several samples of over-the-counter topical antimicrobial skin sanitizer and skin protectant products revealed high levels of various bacteria, including some associated with unsanitary conditions"", the agency reveals. The inspection uncovered serious deviations from FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements. The FDA adds these findings are particularly concerning because the products are promoted as antimicrobial agents that claim to treat open wounds, damaged skin, and protect against various infectious diseases. ""Some of these bacteria can cause opportunistic infections of the skin and underlying tissues,"" FDA adds. Such infections may need medical or surgical attention, and may result in permanent damage. The FDA is warning consumers to not use any Clarcon products and to throw these products away in household refuse."
EU trade partners in dilemma with ban on animal testing,"Campaigns from animal rights groups in Europe have gained public support against the use of animals for testing the safety of cosmetic products. In September 2004, the European Union officially prohibited the use of animals for testing finished cosmetic products. More recently, on 11 March 2009, two bans entered into force prohibiting any further testing on animals to assess the safety of ingredients, whether or not an alternative method is available, but tests measuring long-term toxic effects are temporarily exempted and will be phased out on 11 March 2013 only. These bans have alerted the cosmetics industry in countries such as China and Japan, where animal tests are still the prevailing method to assess the safety of cosmetic products. The European Union prohibits the sale of cosmetic products that contain ingredients tested on animals for the purpose of meeting the requirements of own legislation on cosmetics, wherever in the world the tests were performed. While this question is not entirely clear, it is likely that ingredients tested on animals in a non-EU country for meeting the requirements of this country would not be concerned by the ban and that manufacturers in these countries would still be allowed to export their products to the European Union. However, while their products may still be legally imported into the European Union, China and Japan have understood it may not be sustainable from a marketing perspective. On the other hand, European companies exporting to China and Japan may have to conduct animal tests to get their products accepted by local authorities. The latest edition of China's Hygiene Standards for Cosmetics effective on 1 July 2007 still requires using animals for tests of toxicity, such as acute oral toxicity test, acute dermal toxicity test, dermal irritation/corrosion test, acute eye irritation/corrosion test, skin sensitisation test, skin phototoxicity test, subchronic oral toxicity test, subchronic dermal toxicity test, teratogenicity test, and combined chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity test. Alternative non-animal based tests are still in their preliminary stage of development in China. However, Chinese authorities are working to shift to alternative methods and have started to trigger a decrease in the use of animals based testing. Japan's law requires using animal tests to assess the safety of products classified as quasi-drugs, such as skin-lightening products, suntan lotion and hair growth tonics that can be advertised as medicinal, and companies are expected to carry out animal testing whenever they add or change ingredients. In 2005, Japanese authorities created the Japanese Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Methods, but the project was lacking staff and funds. The secretariat for the Center is now under the responsibility of the National Institute of Health Sciences. But the country first needs to adopt a legal framework to officially aim at decreasing the number of tests performed on animals."
"Taiwan creates agency to supervise drugs, food, cosmetics","Taiwan's Legislative Yuan just passed a bill creating an agency to supervise safety issues related to food, drugs and cosmetics placed on the market. Under the Department of Health (DOH), the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (TFDA) will take charge of issues previously handled by the DOH's Bureau of Pharmaceutical Affairs, Bureau of Food Safety, Bureau of Food and Drug Analysis and Bureau of Controlled Drugs."
MEPs call for more prudence on nanomaterials,"MEPs deplore the absence of a proper evaluation of nanomaterials in the European Union. They say nanomaterials potentially present significant new risks due to their size, such as increased reactivity and mobility, possibly leading to increased toxicity in combination with unrestricted access to the human body, and possibly involving quite different mechanisms of interference with the physiology of human and environmental species. The Parliament calls for the provision of information to consumers on the use of nanomaterials in consumer products: all ingredients present in the form of nanomaterials in substances, mixtures or articles should be clearly indicated in the labelling of the product (e.g. in the list of ingredients, the name of such ingredients should be followed by the word 'nano' in brackets) on the model of what it will soon be compulsory for cosmetic products. Thus the report calls specifically on the Commission to evaluate the need to review REACH concerning: – simplified registration for nanomaterials manufactured or imported below one tonne, – consideration of all nanomaterials as new substances, – a chemical safety assessment for all registered nanomaterials, featuring exposure assessment. MEPs also ask the Commission to evaluate the need to review worker protection legislation, and the development of adequate testing protocols and metrology standards to assess the hazard of, and exposure of workers, consumers and the environment to nanomaterials over their entire life cycle, including in the case of accidents, using a multi- disciplinary approach."
Cosmetic innovation under REACH,"Premium Beauty News - First of all, what is Reach? Laurence Mulon - REACH, stands for Registration Evaluation Authorization, of Chemicals. The regulation came into force on 1 June 2007 with the aim to assess the risk of chemicals with regard to human health and the environment. Its scope covers all chemicals placed on the European market in quantities exceeding one 1000kg per year. REACH stands on a basic principle: ""No Data, No Market"". Furthermore, REACH also includes compulsory data sharing provisions within the frame of the evaluation procedure, with the aim to reduce tests performed on vertebrates. Premium Beauty News - What is the outline of the registration procedure? Laurence Mulon - Registration became compulsory on June 1, 2007. However, the substances that were already sold in Europe and were duly pre-registered before this date benefit from extended registration deadlines. The deadline depends on the tonnage band and the hazardous properties of the substance. The staggered deadlines are: 30 November 2010, 31 May 2013 or 31 May 2018 Registration is costly and it is likely that some substances that suppliers will deem unprofitable as such will be withdrawn from the market. Another consequence should be the increased cost of registered substances. Premium Beauty News - How can REACH be accommodated with the other regulatory requirements already applicable to cosmetics? Laurence Mulon - The legislation governing cosmetic products in Europe is constantly evolving. Tests on animals have been banned for both finished products and the ingredients (within a detailed schedule), the labelling of fragrance allergens is now compulsory and the use of substances classified as CMR 1 and 2 has been prohibited, such as the use of some glycol ethers. As far as cosmetic ingredients are concerned, REACH adds another regulatory layer to the rules applicable to cosmetics. However, the two sets of regulations may be divergent and sometimes contradictory, in particular regarding the toxicological evaluation of substances used as cosmetic ingredients. with testing on animals is allowed contrary to the directive. While tests on animals are forbidden by the regulations applicable to cosmetics products, there are compulsory under REACH. The European Commission subsequently had to clarify this point ad has indicated that the toxicologic evaluation could be performed using animals for any use but cosmetic. Premium Beauty News - In such circumstances how is it possible to combine regulatory compliance and innovation? Laurence Mulon - There are plenty sources of inspiration and innovation available to cosmetics and perfumes manufacturers, whether they choose to use determined chemicals or natural substances. The first ones are covered by REACH but for the latter ones the situation is more difficult. Indeed, REACH is not the best tool for natural substances as it is not adapted to the specificity and complexity of botanicals. That is the reason why concerned trade bodies have issued a common position regarding the use of natural substances. They submitted this position to the European Commission on November 2007 and to ECHA at the end of 2008. Premium Beauty News - In your opinion, what is the best way to behave under REACH ? Laurence Mulon - I have the conviction that the constraints that REACH imposes should stimulate the emergence of innovations. The sourcing of new raw materials being simultaneously environment-friendly and ethical and « natural », may be a solution. Another way is to innovate through greener manufacturing processes and through the development of new formulations. Eventually, organisational innovations are also required, based on the concepts of substance (instead of raw material) and of sustainable development at every step of the supply chain. Premium Beauty News - What about innovation in the future? Laurence Mulon - In the past, the beauty industry and beauty products have already been submitted to this kind of innovation-stimulating regulatory constraints. In the future, regulatory requirements should continue to complexify themselves. NGO should also increase their pressure through the media. These new requirements are becoming strategic trigger to innovation."
EU scientific advisory committees elect their chairs,"On 26 and 27 March 2009, the new European Commission scientific committees on consumer, health and environmental risks held their inaugural plenary sessions. In their opening meeting, the three committees elected their Chairs and six Vice Chairs: Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety – Chair: Dr Ian R. White – Vice Chairs: Professors Vera Rogiers and Tore Sanner Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) – Chair: professor James Wilfrid Bridges – Vice Chairs:Professor Philippe Hartemann and Dr Wim De Jong Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER) – Chair: Professor Helmut Greim – Vice Chairs: Professor H. Autrup and Dr Jose V. Tarazona In welcoming the Committees, Robert Madelin, Director General of the Health and Consumers Directorate General said ""The role of independent scientific advice bodies for the EU decision making process is well established. Sound science is vital for providing policy makers with information to ensure the high level of health and environmental protection that European citizens expect from the EU institutions."" Each Scientific Committee has 17 independent scientists as members. If necessary, they can associate up to five members from a Pool of 190 scientific advisors, in order to provide specific expertise."
New EU cosmetics regulation: what's changing?,"After one reading, the European Parliament agreed on 24 March 2009 on a compromise text negotiated together with the Council and aiming at simplifying procedures while strengthening certain elements of the regulatory framework for cosmetics. The new legislation will take the form of a European Regulation, making it immediately enforceable as law in all EU member states simultaneously. At the difference of the Directive currently applicable to cosmetic products [1], the new text will not need to be transposed into national law in each member states, thus not giving room for diverging interpretations. As part of the simplification of administrative procedures, the text creates a single EU-wide register for cosmetic products and increases the cooperation between market surveillance authorities. In replacement of the various national procedures, the text introduces an EU-wide compulsory notification system of cosmetic products, including the obligation to declare the presence of substances in the form of nanomaterials before placing products on the market. The required information will be transmitted to the Commission through electronic means. Undesirable side effects induced by cosmetic products will also be monitored at the European scale. For the first time ever, a European legislation addresses nanoparticles as such. As requested by the European Parliament, the new regulation introduces a safety assessment procedure for all products containing nanomaterials, which could lead to a ban on a substance if there is a risk to human health. Cosmetic products containing nanoparticules will have to be notified to the Commission six months prior being placed on the market. In case of concern regarding the safety of a nanomaterial, the Commision will have to seize the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) for giving an opinion. Members of European Parliament (MEPs) also pushed successfully for any nanomaterials present in cosmetics to be mentioned in the list of ingredients on the packaging. In the list of ingredients, concerned substances will be followed by the word ""nano"" in brackets (e.g.: Titanium dioxyde [nano]). MEPs have also introduced a definition of a nanomaterial as ""an insoluble or bioresistant and intentionally manufactured material with one or more external dimensions, or an internal structure, on the scale from 1 to 100 nm."" This is the first time that a definition of nanomaterials is introduced in European law. The Commission will have to adapt this definition in line with scientific and technological advances. However, environmental organisations and the BEUC, the European consumers' organisation, have criticised the s narrowness of the definition's scope. On the use of product claims for cosmetics, the Commission is asked to adopt a list determining common criteria. Such a list aims at harmonising the opinion of public authorities in the various member states concerning what claims are acceptable or unacceptable for cosmetic products. The regulation provides for strict rules for the use of substances which are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction (CMR). The use of those substances is basically forbidden in cosmetics and they can only be used in exceptional cases under strict conditions, which have been tightened up by the compromise. The proposed text also addresses substances with endocrine-disrupting properties, that will be regulated when European or internationally agreed criteria for identifying them or at the latest five years after the Regulation has entered into force. The existing provisions banning animal testing for finished cosmetic products as of 2004, with a phasing-out period for animal tests on cosmetic ingredients by 2009/2013, are unaffected by the new regulation MEPs adopted the proposed regulation with 633 votes in favour, 29 against with 11 abstentions. The Council must now approve the same text so that it becomes law and comes into effect in 2012 Download text here:"
EU ban on animal testing raises questions,"On 11 March 2009, two bans entered into force. The first ban prohibits any further testing on animals to assess the safety of ingredients, whether or not an alternative method is available, but tests measuring long-term toxic effects are temporarily exempted and will be phased out on 11 March 2013 only. In brief, it is now illegal to use animals for assessing the skin irritancy, phototoxicity, corrosivity, percutaneous absorption, genotoxicity, ocular irritancy and acute toxicity of cosmetic products. But using animals to perform carcinogenicity, photoallergy, cutaneous sensitivity, toxicokinetics, reprotoxicity, teratogenesis, toxicity – sub chronic and chronic, and photomutagenesis tests remains acceptable until 11 March 2013. Furthermore, there are grey areas regarding the so-called ""multiple purpose ingredients"". Certain ingredients are not only used to make cosmetics but pharmaceuticals, or detergents or whatever else. These ingredients are therefore submitted to other regulations that may require performing animal tests. Scientists from other industry sectors in Europe, such as the pharmaceutical, chemical and food industries, are all legally obliged to use alternative methods where they exist. But where there's none? Another limit is REACH. Indeed, the EU regulation for the Registration, Evaluation, and Authorisation of Chemicals requires just about all substances produced or imported into the EU in quantities of more than one tonne, to be tested, even if these substances are part of an object. REACH applies to all substances, regardless of whether they are new or not. The difficulty is that the vast majority of substances will be tested on animals because REACH requires it, not because of their use in cosmetics but because of other uses, and the non-availability of alternatives. Eventually, there are also grey areas in the second ban that entered into force last week. The ban prohibits the sale of cosmetic products that contain ingredients tested on animals for the purpose of meeting the requirements of the EU Cosmetics Directive, wherever in the world the tests were performed, but what about ingredients that have been tested on animals in a non-EU country for meeting the requirements of this country? The use of animals for testing finished cosmetic products has been prohibited since September 2004. The impact of this initial ban was low as ""the European cosmetics industry had already moved away from testing cosmetic products on animals some time before this,"" claims the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association (CTPA) in a release. However, certain finished products may nevertheless be tested on animals to comply with the regulation of non-EU States. That is the case of cosmetics exported to China. In order to be sold in this country, cosmetics must be tested on animals (the tests are performed by Chinese authorities in accredited laboratories). The situation is similar for Chinese products imported in the European Union. These products are not concerned by the EU bans because they have not been tested on animals to meet the requirements of the European Cosmetics Directive, but those of overseas regulations. Considering the answers to the questions above it is unlikely that these claims disappear. Voluntary certifications, such as the Leaping Bunny Program or the Humane Cosmetics Standard of the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV), will certainly try to address grey areas and loopholes of the legislation in order to continue to sort ""cruelty-free"" products from the others. These certifications may help consumers to sort products complying with their personal convictions, but they may also add to the confusion by implying that in the context of a general ban certain some companies are more ethical than others! Testing ingredients on animals is now banned irrespective of whether there is an alternative method available. Actually, validated alternatives exist for only four of the seven categories of tests for which the ban is now effective. Companies have no option when it comes to assess the ocular irritancy, skin sensitivity or toxicokinetics, for instance. Does that mean that new ingredients may be used while some important information about the safety would be lacking? The Cosmetics Directive would not permit it, as its second article, providing that ""a cosmetic product put on the market within the Community must not cause damage to human health"" is always applicable. However, it is not unlikely that ingredient innovation be partially blocked by the ban as long as additional alternatives are not available. Difficulties may occur when long-time used cosmetic ingredients become suspicious. In such a case, the Directive provides that ""where serious concerns arise as regards the safety of an existing cosmetic ingredient a Member State may request the Commission to grant a derogation"" in order to perform animal tests. However, this option is strictly limited and derogations are only granted in exceptional circumstances."
French Health Agency sifts through organic cosmetics,"The survey was conducted last year over 30 product samples corresponding to 28 different products gathered from the whole French territory by AFSSAPS and DGCCRF inspectors. 22 out of the 28 products were certified organic or natural products (Ecocert, Visagro, ICEA-AIAB, BDIH), while 6 were only labelled as ""natural / organic product"". Furthermore, 12 products claimed to be preservative free and 16 claimed to be paraben free and / or phenoxyethanol free. The later were using other preservatives such as benzoic or sorbic acid, benzoic alcohol and dehydroacetic acid. Eventually, despite a restrictive use of preservatives, the Agency deems the microbial quality of tested products is ""satisfactory"". Nevertheless, batches of a product contaminated with pseudomonas putida bacteria have been withdrawn from the market. Another product was notified a lack of microbial protection that could lead to a contamination during its foreseeable period of use. The most surprising results came from the chemical analysis of the products. Indeed, tests revealed that 6 products claiming to be ""paraben and / or phenoxyethanol free"" contained traces of methylparaben at a concentration varying from 0.01 to 0.04%. Another product, claiming to be preservative free contained traces of benzoic or sorbic acid salts. However, according to the Agency ""concentrations detected are 20 to 60 times lower than the maximum limits permitted by the regulation."" Actually, the presence of these traces could result from their use in the raw materials, in particular in ingredients from botanical origin. Concerned companies would not have deliberately misled consumers buy would have failed to correctly control their supply chain. In parallel, the DGCCRF has warned manufacturers that highlighting the absence of a specific preservative in the product's formula, while the product would contain other types of anti-bacterial agents could be considered as misleading for the consumer. ""Providing consumers with information that is voluntarily incomplete, might be considered as misleading about the actual product's formula,"" states the control body in a release."
"Transatlantic partnership for ""Made with Organic"" cosmetics","Brussels-based Natural and Organic Cosmetic Association (NaTrue) and US-based Quality Assurance International (QAI), are partnering for the mutual recognition of their respective ""made with organic ingredients"" standards for personal care products. NSF/ANSI 305 Made with Organic Personal Care Products is a consensus-based standard for personal care products featuring organic ingredient specifications. NSF/ANSI 305 was recently adopted as an American National Standard by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). It was developed by NSF International with the participation of key stakeholder groups, including organic personal care manufacturers, trade associations, regulators and organic product retailers. The NSF/ANSI 305 standard allows ""made with organic"" claims for products with organic content of 70 percent or more that comply with all other requirements of the standard. Products covered by the standard include rinse-off and leave-on personal care and cosmetic products, as well as oral care and personal hygiene products. The standard specifies materials, processes, production criteria, and conditions that shall be met in order for made with personal care products to make organic label and marketing claims. Quality Assurance International (QAI) is a USDA-accredited certifying agent who provides organic certification of products within the NSF/ANSI 305 standard. NaTrue, which launched its natural cosmetics label last year, just announced that 100 products have been certified as of February 1st 2009. According NaTrue the partnership was made possible as both the NaTrue-Label and the NSF/ANSI 305 standard, whilst not identical, share ""the same fundamental objective"". In order to help manufacturers to demonstrate compliance with both standards, QAI and NaTrue are developing a guidance document to identify the differences and analyze gaps. By consolidating two certification processes into one, this initiative is expected to create important cost-savings and time- savings for interested manufacturers."
Triclosan: European experts cautious about safety,"The SCCP, one of the three independent non-food panels of experts that provide the European Commission with scientific advice, considers that ""the continued use of triclosan as a preservative at the current concentration limit of maximum 0.3% in all cosmetic products is not safe for the consumer because of the magnitude of the aggregate exposure"". The SCCP opinion [1] is based on new toxicological data provided by the industry. In particular, data from the percutaneous absorption studies conducted with triclosan [2] indicate that it was relatively well absorbed through the skin in all species tested. However, ""the use of triclosan at a maximum concentration of 0.3% in toothpastes, hand soaps, body soaps/shower gels and deodorant sticks is considered safe,"" the SCCP says. Any additional use of triclosan in face powders and blemish concealers at this concentration is also considered safe. Actually, the SCCP considers that well documented studies on human exposure show that that triclosan is safe in these cases. Nevertheless, the use of triclosan in other leave-on products (e.g. body lotions) and in mouthwashes is not considered safe for the consumer due to the resulting high exposures. Eventually, the SCCP says that before a final conclusion on the safety of triclosan in cosmetic products can be reached, the potential development of resistance to triclosan and cross-resistance by certain micro-organisms must be assessed. This aspect will be discussed in a separate opinion and is also investigated by the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks."
Cosmetics for babies: safety assessments must be improved,"Polemics that sparkled during the Autumn 2008 in France aboutthe safety of baby care cosmetic products, led the Agency to tighten its controls on products intended for children of less than 3 years old. A first set of eighteen inspections was subsequently performed on a panel of forty products (wet wipes, foaming gels…), with the aim ""to take stock of the data available and the work already conducted by manufacturers,"" but also ""to verify that firms do comply with their obligations"". Inspections did not reveal major discrepancies with regard to ingredients in the products, microbial quality or labelling. As far as these areas are concerned, controlled products duly complied with applicable regulations. However, the AFSSAPS pointed out safety assessment loopholes. Inspections revealed that companies would partly fail to comply with the specific assessment requirements applicable to products for children less than 3 years old. This additional assessment has been required since November 2004. The Agency said that requests for additional information were sent to several manufacturers who presented ""incomplete"" data. Furthermore, the Agency suspended the manufacture and sale of a product for which this specific assessment was missing. According to the AFSSAPS, methods used by cosmetics makers for assessing the safety of products for young children do not give satisfaction. A dedicated working group was created within the Agency, with the aim to identify what are the key issues for this specific assessment and in order to issue official recommendations. A first meeting was held on October 2008 and concerned companies were consulted."
Europe updates its regulations for cosmetic ingredients,"The directive 2009/06/EC of 4 February 2009 [1] prohibits the use of phytonadione and of diethylene glycol (DEG) in all cosmetic products put on the market of the European Union. The prohibition of phytonadione (a man-made form of vitamin K) in cosmetic products is due to the fact that this substance may cause cutaneous allergy and individuals so affected may be denied an important therapeutic agent. Concerning diethylene glycol (DEG), scientific experts of the European Union consider that it should not be used as an ingredient in cosmetic products, but that a maximum concentration of up to 0,1 % of DEG from impurities in the finished cosmetic products can be considered to be safe. This is the reason why, in spite of this substance being banned for use in cosmetic products, presence of residual traces are admitted up to 0,1 %. Furthermore, the directive has restricted the use of toluene, a substance classified as a CMR substance of category 3, of diethylene glycol monobutyl ether (DEGBE) and of ethylene glycol monobutyl ether (EGBE). Toluene is subsequently limited to 25 % in nail products and its inhalation by children should be avoided. The use of DEGBE as a solvent in hair dye products is limited to a concentration up to 9,0 %. The use of EGBE as a solvent is limited to a maximum concentration of 4,0 % in oxidative hair dye products and 2,0 % in non-oxidative hair dye products. Member States shall apply those provisions from 5 November 2009. However, they shall apply the provisions concerning the substance toluene from 5 February 2010.

Canada to restrict the use of four chemicals in cosmetics,"Canadian Minister of Health, Leona Aglukkaq, and Minsiter of Environment, Jim Prentice, have announced that assessment measures of batches of chemical substances used in Canada have concluded that five of them are potentially harmful to human health (thiourea, Pigment Yellow 34, Pigment Red 104, isoprene and epichlorohydrin), while three others appear to be of concern to the environment. ""Although Canadians' exposure to the five substances of concern to human health is very low, regulations are being proposed for four of these substances to prevent them from being used in the future without undergoing a new series of assessments. In addition, two of these substances will be added to the Cosmetic Ingredient Hotlist to prevent their future use in cosmetics,"" the Government announced. The substances that will be prohibited ain cosmetics are epichlorohydrin and isoprene, which are sometimes used to manufacture lipstick and other personal care products in the USA and Canada. Three other substances were found toxic to the environment: siloxanes D4 and D5, and 2,4,6-tri-tert-butylphenol or TTBP. Siloxanes D4 and D5 are used as emollients to soften the skin. Siloxanes are found in most personal care products on the market in Canada and the United States. The siloxanes are also used in textiles, paints and coatings, antiperspirants, sealants, lubricants, plastics, non-medical ingredients in pharmaceuticals, silicone polymers, food additives, surface treatments. The final assessments conclude that siloxanes are not a concern for human health, based on the amount of these substances that an individual would be exposed to through the use of various products, including personal care products. However, siloxanes D4 and D5, which are widely used in products across Canada, are considered as entering the environment in relatively large quantities, stay in the environment a long time (persistent), and may harm fish and aquatic organisms. ""To limit the amount of D4 and D5 that is released to the environment, the Government of Canada is proposing to set a concentration limit for D4 and D5 in products. This will minimize the amount of D4 and D5 in personal care products that is released to municipal wastewater streams when they are washed off,"" the Government explained. The third substance (TTBP), a fuel additive, will be managed so that releases to the environment will be reduced below levels that can be measured. The Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 requires every new chemical substance made in Canada or imported from other countries since 1994 be assessed against specific criteria. In 2006, Canada completed the major task of systematically sorting through the approximately 23,000 existing substances introduced into Canada before the creation of stronger environmental legislation. This exercise was called ""categorization."""
Canada opens consultation on heavy metal impurities,"The purpose of Health Canada's guidance is to determine and communicate appropriate limits for heavy metal impurities in cosmetic products, particularly limits for lead, arsenic, cadmium, mercury and antimony that are known to have significant toxicological properties. Actually, these heavy metals, as well as chromium, are prohibited as intentional ingredients in cosmetic products sold in Canada. ""Yet impurities exist due to the persistent nature of these substances and the fact that they are found in the natural environment,"" Health Canada points out. The draft guidance provides that ""heavy metal impurities in cosmetic products are unavoidable due to the ubiquitous nature of these elements, but should be removed wherever technically feasible"" and that heavy metal concentrations in cosmetic products would be seen to be technically avoidable when they exceed the following limits: ""These levels are based on background levels found in cosmetic products sampled in Canada and are in line with acceptable levels of impurities in other jurisdictions,"" Health Canada comments."
Terms of payment in France: consequences of recent regulatory changes,"As far as business to business trade relations are concerned, the shortening of settlement periods is, together with the end of slotting fees, the most important innovation of the recent Law for the modernization of the French economy. ""For the first time, a law aims to shorten settlement periods, which used to be very long in France,"" Frédéric Manin said. The law provides that the settlement period cannot exceed 45 days from the last day of the month, or 60 calendar days, starting from the date of the invoice. According to Frédéric Manin, this new threshold combines the advantages of transparency and, for the first time, of possible sanction from public authorities. ""There are derogatory provisions, but they need a formal agreement within a defined industry, they are submitted to restrictive conditions and can only be temporary,"" Mr Manin explained. Furthermore, no ""rebate"" can be claimed to compensate shortened payment terms subsequent to this new regulatory framework. Such rebates are admissible only when they are applied as to compensate a real commercial service, not the mere application of the law shortening payment terms."
China to require full labelling of cosmetic ingredients,"According to Chinese media reports, Beijng authorities will require cosmetic products, whether imported or locally-made to be marked with all their ingredients. Current Chinese regulations [1] require cosmetics to be labelled with the following indications: – name and address of the manufacturer, – name and address of the importer / distributor or of the legally registered agent in China (for imported goods), – name of the product [2] – net quantity, – date of production and 'quality assurance period', or, batch number of production and expiry date, – storage conditions that are required to guarantee the minimum durability of the product and its safety (if necessary), – safety precautions and directions for use, – country of origin, – production license and hygiene license numbers (or registration numbers, for imported cosmetics), and the number of the corresponding product standard. Of course, these mandatory requirements are to be labelled in Chinese. If confirmed, China's requirement for a full labelling of cosmetic ingredients would align Chinese regulations on Europe and US laws, both requiring cosmetic producers to disclose the lists of ingredients in their products. The new requirement is set to be effective before June 2010 and the sales of products failing to meet the new policy would be prohibited at that time."
What's new with intellectual property rights in France?,"Premium Beauty News - The law governing intellectual property rights in France was reinforced recently. Could you give us more details? Matthieu Bourgeois - This reinforcement of the legislation is mainly due to the ""law for the modernisation of the economy"", in French loi de modernisation de l'économie or LME, dated August 4 2008. The new law primarily focused on improving the protection of brand licensees. Whether they hold rights on a trademark, a patent or a design, licensees are now entitled to participate in intellectual property infringement proceedings against a third party, even though in the event where their license contract would not have been published by the French trademark office (Institut National de la Propriété Industrielle - INPI). The previous situation, which was a major obstacle to fight infringement behaviours, is now outdated. Secondly, the LME provides that all litigation related to intellectual property rights shall be the jurisdiction of the French civil court (the Tribunal de grande instance). It is something new for copyrights that used to be in the jurisdiction of commercial or labour courts. Litigations between employers and employees, where intellectual property issues are more and more frequent, should no longer be submitted to labour courts (Conseils des prud'hommes). This may decrease the number of cases that employees submit to courts, as they will have to file two proceedings, thus implying additional costs. Premium Beauty News - What about trademarks? Matthieu Bourgeois - The LME authorized the French government to implement the main provisions of the Singapore Treaty [1] . The implementation has been fulfilled through the Ordinance N. 2008-1301 of the French government of December 11, 2008 [2] , which simplifies and improves the trademark registration proceedings in France. However, this text is a bit disappointing, as it does not contain anything new about the scope of protection of trademarks, while certain provisions of the Singapore Treaty dealing with non-visible signs, such as olfactory signs, for instance, would have made possible to introduce some changes in this area. Unfortunately, the divergence between the French law - which still refuses olfactory signs as trademarks - and the OHMI, the European office in charge of European trademarks - which accepts the validity of such signs as trademarks [3] - is still pending. Premium Beauty News - Did the law also change the rules governing patents? Matthieu Bourgeois - As far as patents are concerned, there are two important news in the LME. On the one hand, the patentability field is extended to ""technological sectors"" [4] , and to the second therapeutic application [5] . On the other hand, the LME provides that a patent holder has the possibility to limit the scope of protection of its own patent, in order to escape to the nullity that would be raised by the adversory party during infringement proceedings. Once again, French lawmakers have greatly improved the protection of owners' of intellectual property rights. Indeed, the nullity of patents was often raised when their scope was not sufficiently described."
French health agency slashes Cattier,"The French Agency has suspended the manufacture and sale of a body and hair foaming gel produced by natural and organic cosmetics maker Cattier. The Agency says key documents are missing in the product's information package. French and European regulations require cosmetics manufacturers to keep an information file readily available to control bodies for each product placed on the European Union market. According to the French agency, Cattier has no been able to show the assessment corresponding to the concerned foaming gel. Subsequently, the specific assessment regarding products intended for children's is also missing. The AFSSAPS detected these key pieces were lacking on the occasion of an inspection conducted in the company's facilities on October 14, 2008. The Agency said Cattier failed to provide enough additional elements until December 15 and therefore decided to adopt a precautionary decision and to suspend the production and sale of the foaming gel. In the wake of a strong media buzz and polemics regarding the safety of baby care cosmetic products and their distribution of in maternities, the AFSSAPS announced its intention to tighten controls over cosmetics intended for children of less than 3 years old. Furthermore, since the outset of 2008, the French control body had been operating series of controls focusing on natural and organic cosmetics. In 2009, the Agency wants to evaluate the safety assessment methods specifically developed by manufacturers of baby care goods Otherwise, the AFSSAPS also announced reinforced controls for other product categories, in particular so-called ethnic products, including skin whitening and skin lightening products, as well as hair curling and hair straightening products."
French and European authorities question chemical exposure,"In a draft report published on November 19 [1], three EU scientific committees [2] assess the applicability of the so-called Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) approach to the human health-related risk assessment of chemical substances. Based on the concept of ""safe levels of exposure"", TTC is an approach that aims to establish a human exposure threshold value below which there is a very low probability of an appreciable risk to human health. The European Commission asked the three scientific committees to review the available scientific literature as well as a Colipa [3] report which stated that while being a useful additional tool in the absence of chemical-specific toxicology data, the TTC concept did not provide a full safety assessment of cosmetic ingredients and impurities, in particular regarding local effects at the site of application. In their conclusion, the three scientific bodies say that: ""The principle of the TTC approach in itself is scientifically acceptable. However, the application of this principle in terms of risk assessment for safety evaluation of a chemical is dependent on the quality, quantity, and relevance of the underlying toxicity database, and a reliable estimation of the exposure to the chemical in the respective field of application."" So far, only limited information and knowledge exist on the levels of exposure linked to a wide variety of consumer products, such as cosmetics, where ""complex exposure scenarios"" and ""multiple exposure routes"" have to be considered. This preliminary report comes just days before a 30 December deadline to pre-register substances for safety screening and registration under the EU's chemical regulation REACH. Conclusions can be commented upon until 2 January 2009. In parallel, on the occasion of a scientific conference on the links between human fertility, children development and chemical exposure, which was held in Paris on November 25, French Minister of Health, Roselyne Bachelot, and her colleague Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Minister of Ecology, announced they would call upon the French Agency for the Medical Safety of Health Products (AFSSAPS) to assess the risks posed by cosmetics during pregnancy and for young children. Two months ago, after polemics regarding the distribution of cosmetics in maternities, the Agency already announced its intention to tighten controls over cosmetics intended for children of less than 3 years old. At the same time, the Agency also announced the creation of an ad hoc working group that would evaluate the safety assessment methods specifically developed by manufacturers of baby care goods. French Health Minister also said she will launch a campaign to inform pregnant women about the possible risks linked to the exposure with certain chemical substances in a variety of products, including paints, pesticides, etc. (not specifically in cosmetics!) and would consider the possibility of a logo identifying products containing substances that are toxic to reproduction. However, such a labelling system should be dealt with at the European level where the rules governing cosmetic products are currently under revision. ""[We do] not think this is something which is suitable for individual countries to take forward unilaterally and hope that the French raise this during the current negotiations on the revision of the cosmetics directive, where a discussion can take place among experts on cosmetic products,"" a spokesperson for the British Department for Business, Enterprise & Regulatory Reform (BERR) told The Independent last week. French authorities have also announced a review of carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic substances (CMR) classified in the third category of the group. Indeed, CMR substances are classified according to three levels of toxicity: CMR1 are substances that are known to be toxic, CMR2 are substances that are likely to be toxic, and CMR3 are possibly toxic but need further assessment. While CMR1 and CMR2 are forbidden for use in cosmetics, the use of CMR3 remains possible. However, the French cosmetics trade body (FEBEA) denied any use of endocrine disruptor [4] in cosmetics products. According to the trade body, there is a lot of incorrect and misleading information regarding this matter. For instance, FEBEA said the cosmetics industry does not use bisphenol A and only uses one phthalate (diethylphthalate or DEP). According to the SCCP [5], DEP is not an endocrine disruptor, FEBEA said. Similarly, the parabens that are authorised for use in cosmetics (methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, iso propyl-, butyl-, and iso butyl-parabens) are considered as safe for use by the SCCP. ""It is important to stress again that any ingredient used in a cosmetic product, whether natural or man-made, must be safe,"" added CTPA, the UK's cosmetics trade body. Actually, what would be the meaning of a logo warning women of a potential risk, while French and European legislations stress that cosmetics must be safe? Whether the legislations are inefficient and must be changed, or the logo story is a scaring nonsense."
COSMÉTOSCIENCES: A cosmetics research program in France,"The French cosmetics industry, which brings together 3,500 companies, 80% of which are SMEs, is the second largest contributor to the country's trade balance. This highly strategic sector for the French economy operates in a growing global market that is attracting more and more countries. In 2021, France was the world's leading exporter of cosmetics with over 14,5% of the export market. In front of a strong competition from Asian countries, especially South Korea, Japan, and China, France remains the market leader thanks to a dynamic research on the subjects of innovations of the perfumery and cosmetic industry. In such a context, R&D and innovation are key elements to establish the values of the ""French brand"". The Centre-Val de Loire region has made cosmetics the core focus of its Regional Innovation Strategy, spawning the COSMÉTOSCIENCES program in 2015. Led by the University of Orléans, the project involves the University of Tours, the CNRS, the Cosmetic Valley competitiveness hub and Le Studium Loire Valley institute. Since 2015, 40 collaborative research projects have emerged, involving various research teams at 35 businesses in the cosmetics sector. Over 5 years, the combined workforce dedicated to cosmetics research in the Centre-Val de Loire region has reached 120 Full-Time Equivalents and published close on 100 papers. This dynamic allows researchers to promote their skills and expertise with new academic and industry partners in order to set up or contribute to projects with a national or international scope. The research activities developed within COSMÉTOSCIENCES focus on current cornerstones of the cosmetics industry that best meet consumer expectations: eco-responsible cosmetics, efficacy, safety and ""Made in France"". The program's three key focus areas for research, development and innovation are: – Naturalness and eco-responsible processes, – Characterisation of a product's biological activity and safety, – Formulation and sensoriality. COSMÉTOSCIENCES federates 23 research teams from 10 academic laboratories at the University of Orléans, the University of Tours and the CNRS, whose expertise spans the entire cosmetic product value chain. COSMÉTOSCIENCES is the only regionally structured cosmetics research program in Europe, the skills and visibility of which are gradually gaining momentum. It is part of a regional dynamic with a strong national and international outreach. European partnerships are being set up to use the network's expertise to promote innovation within the French industry sector.

"Hair straightening chemicals could increase uterine cancer risk, research finds","The National Institutes of Health (NIH) looked into the chemical products used by women to straighten their curly or frizzy hair. The procedure, which involves modifying the texture of the hair in question to make it straight, is apparently not without health risks. Such are the findings of this study conducted among 33,497 American women aged 35 to 74, over a period of nearly 11 years, who participated in a survey led by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) seeking to identify the factors involved in several diseases, including some forms of cancer. [1] The major study, which identified 378 cases of uterine cancer, reports that women who used chemicals to straighten their hair had a higher risk of developing uterine cancer than those who did not. The scientists found no link between uterine cancer and other hair products, such as dyes, bleaches, highlights or perms. It should be noted, however, that it was essentially the women who declared using these straightening products ""frequently"" — meaning more than four times in the previous year — who were more likely to develop this type of cancer. This risk, according to the researchers, was twice as high compared to those who did not use these products. Note, however, that the risk of developing uterine cancer following frequent exposure to these chemicals appears to be relatively low according to the figures provided by the scientists. Moreover, the study did not collect any data on the brands or on the ingredients contained in the products used. ""We estimated that 1.64% of women who never used hair straighteners would go on to develop uterine cancer by the age of 70; but for frequent users, that risk goes up to 4.05%,"" said Alexandra White, Ph.D., head of the NIEHS Environment and Cancer Epidemiology group and lead author on the new study. ""This doubling rate is concerning. However, it is important to put this information into context — uterine cancer is a relatively rare type of cancer."" According to previous data, the incidence rate of uterine cancer appears to be on the rise in the United States, and particularly among Black women, with more than 65,000 new cases estimated in 2022. In its study, the NIH indicates that 60% of the women who said they had used chemicals to straighten their hair were Black women, implying that the effects on their health could be more significant due to this higher prevalence of use. It is also within this population that the incidence is rising the most. ""Because Black women use hair straightening or relaxer products more frequently and tend to initiate use at earlier ages than other races and ethnicities, these findings may be even more relevant for them,"" said Che-Jung Chang, Ph.D., an author on the new study and a research fellow in the NIEHS Epidemiology Branch. While the correlation found in the study show there is a potential problem with hair straighteners, more research is warranted to identify specific chemicals driving this observed association. Formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasing chemicals, which are part of some straighteners, have already been identified as playing a potential role in hormone-sensitive carcinogenesis. ""A fundamental principle of epidemiology is that association is not the same as causation; one does not necessarily lead to the other. The association observed in the study is with people who straighten their hair, not the ingredients in hair products or any specific chemicals as this data was not collected,"" commented Kimberly Norman, Senior Director, Safety and Regulatory Toxicology, at the Personal Care Products Council (PCPC) in a statement."
Can cellulose replace plastic in packaging?,"As it is foreseen as a solution to replace plastic in the future, cellulose is scrutinized by the packaging sector and its peripheral players. To speed up the development of alternative solutions, in particular to single-use food and cosmetics packaging, the Cellulose Valley teaching and research chair implemented a programme for PhDs, research engineers, and Master's students working on various issues. ""We aim to boost innovation and take advantage of all the scientific developments of the past few years in order to provide this material with properties as close as possible to those of plastic, in particular by improving the barrier function, finding solutions to closing and shaping problems, etc. We intend to develop a high-performing material that will help create recyclable and biodegradable packaging"", explains PhD Julien Bras, who holds the Cellulose Valley chair. This chair was created thanks to eight founding partners who directly or indirectly come from the cellulose ecosystem, including Ahlstrom and DS Smith, providers of cellulose-based solutions, Guillin Emballage and Aptar, who transform the material into packaging, Décathlon, Marie, or Chanel, users, and Citeo, for a global vision of the value chain. These partners finance the chair and launch the new research projects, training actions, exchange sessions, webinars, etc. ""Every year, there is a research project planned with eight Master's specialties, which makes 32, all in all: the students will work on proofs of concept and offer solutions expected by society in these fields. The results will be shared every year: the first day of the inauguration, we unveiled those of the first Master's groups who presented their work on cheese and chocolate packaging, cushioning materials, new types of corrugated cardboard, and high-performing moulded cellulose"", Bras explains. The objective is to work on primary and secondary packaging for the food, cosmetics, and other industries that share the same problems, like the barrier function for liquid formulas, closing constraints, or decorations. Other than being a natural, renewable material, cellulose presents no risk of supply difficulties. ""Cellulose is found in a significant, much underexploited biomass. Nature produces 200 billion tonnes of cellulose, and only six are used, mainly for heating. About 100 million tonnes of plastics are used in the packaging sector today, so I am not really worried about supplying, be it for the original or the recycled material"", says Bras. Launched in early 2022, the Cellulose Valley chair will continue its research work until 2026. All this will take place in parallel to the CDP Cosmethic programme, a tool implemented five years ago by the Institute of Excellence of the Grenoble University to build a bridge between social sciences and chemistry and material sciences, thanks to cosmetics."
Connected skin chips to predict the efficacy of sebum-regulating ingredients,"Sebum is a complex lipids mixture secreted by sebocytes and deposited in stratum corneum for helping to the skin barrier function. Disruption of sebum production leads to common skin diseases, including acne or atopic dermatitis; it also contributes to the development of oily or dry skin and impacts both appearance and beauty of the skin. Solutions to develop more efficient sebum-regulating cosmetics still require more predictive testing ranging from lab data to humans. Success of lab-to-donor data is not easy and quite often fails because of no proper translational readouts. Therefore, Gattefossé and CTIBiotech have joined forces to develop a relevant 3D bio printed model integrating sebocytes for measuring non-invasive parameters in vitro as on real humans while at the same time giving laboratory readouts. Using connected scales, Gattefossé and CTIBiotech used bioimpedance [1] to evaluate changes in the local environment of a 3D skin model integrating sebocytes. Measurement of such a non-invasive electrical activity allowed the scientists to follow in real-time the sebum production, in addition to laboratory readouts dealing with cellular, matrix and tissue development. ""Full thickness skin models containing sebocytes have reproducible oil production which is increased by linoleic acid and reduced by TOFA, and remarkably this is characterized by significant changes in bioimpedance in both printed tissues and culture supernatants surrounding them. Bioimpedance, linked to the sebum production thus proves to be an in vitro non-invasive proper parameter and measurable in real-time, to design ever more predictive and effective testing, since 3D models described here and linked with a simple chip system, accurately mirror changes within skin models as on live donors,"" says Dr. Nicolas Bechetoille, Ph.D/HDR, Research Manager Skin Biology, Head of Biology Laboratory at Gattefossé. While the use of bio-impedance to monitor sebum production by the skin is a natural advance, Professor Colin McGuckin, President and Chief Scientific Officer at CTIBiotech highlights that the real innovation comes from developing real-time analysis for oil changes. ""We advanced our 3D printed full thickness skin models with an integrated bioimpedance chip connected to monitor changes. Linking cosmetics screening in this way advances faster towards human tests and increases our ability to make more effective products,"" he says. This work will be presented at the 32nd IFSCC Congress in London, 19-22 September 2022."
How scientists are working on silk as a greener alternative to microplastics,"Whether in cosmetics, in clothes, detergents and many products of our daily life, microplastics are everywhere. They even have been found in air, water, and soil as well as in the bloodstream of animals and people around the world. While many manufacturers are looking for alternatives to these products, scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in a joint work with BASF, have come up with an alternative that is surprisingly sourced from silkworms [1]. ""The EU has already declared that these added, nonbiodegradable microplastics must be eliminated by 2025, so the search is on for suitable replacements, which do not currently exist,"" the researchers explain in a statement. MIT researchers were interested in the properties of silk fibroins, which are not soluble in water while remaining biodegradable by the proteolytic enzymes commonly produced by living organisms. Using spray drying and ultrasonic spray freeze drying processes, the team of engineers designed and fabricated silk-based microcapsules with a wide range of structures. ""By precisely adjusting the polymer chain arrangements of silk materials and addition of a surfactant, it is possible to fine-tune the properties of the resulting coatings once they dry out and harden,"" the scientists explain. The material can thus be hydrophobic (water-repelling) even though it is made and processed in a water solution, or it can be hydrophilic (water-attracting), or anywhere in between, and for a given application it can be made to match the characteristics of the material it is being used to replace. Considered ""safe"" in the food and medical fields, silk is a biodegradable and non-toxic material for the body. It is also relatively easy to obtain as it can be extracted from the cocoons of silkworms or recovered from used silk fabric (or inferior-quality silk, unusable for textile manufacturing). Currently, 90 percent of the world's silk production takes place in China. However, that's largely because the country has perfected the production of the high-quality silk threads needed for fabrics. The process developed by the MIT engineers uses bulk silk and has no need for a high level of quality. ""Production could easily be ramped up in other parts of the world to meet local demand if this process becomes widely used,"" says MIT professor of civil and environmental engineering Benedetto Marelli, co-author of the research. It is thus possible to carry out these encapsulations from cocoons of non-textile quality or even by recovering the silk of used fabrics. ""The process is simple and can be implemented in existing factories,"" says Muchun Liu, post-doctoral researcher at MIT and lead author of the study. While other similar experiments have been conducted before with biodegradable materials to replace microplastics, the MIT team insists that encapsulating high-content active substances is necessary to pave the way for commercial use. ""The only way to have an impact is where we can not only replace a synthetic polymer with a biodegradable counterpart, but also achieve performance that is the same, if not better,"" explains Benedetto Marelli. Micro-plastics that are intentionally added to consumer products represent only a minor part of the global pollution linked to plastics (10 to 15% according to the European Chemical Agency); indeed, much of the burden comes from other sources, such as the degradation over time of larger plastic objects such as bottles and packaging, and from the wear of car tires. ""We cannot solve the whole microplastics problem with one solution that fits them all. Ten percent of a big number is still a big number,"" highlights MIT professor of civil and environmental engineering Benedetto Marelli, co-author of the research."
"""They're everywhere"": microplastics in oceans, air and human body","Images of plastic pollution have become familiar: a turtle suffocated by a shopping bag, water bottles washed up on beaches, or the monstrous ""Great Pacific Garbage Patch"" of floating detritus. Millions of tonnes of plastic produced every year, largely from fossil fuels, make their way into the environment and degrade into smaller and smaller pieces. ""We did not imagine 10 years ago that there could be so many small microplastics, invisible to the naked eye, and that they were everywhere around us,"" said Jean-Francois Ghiglione, a researcher at the Laboratory of Microbial Oceanography in France. ""And we could not yet envisage finding them in the human body"". Now scientific studies are increasingly detecting microplastics in some human organs — including ""the lungs, spleen, kidneys, and even the placenta,"" Ghiglione told AFP. It may not come as much of a shock that we breathe in these particles present in the air, in particular microfibres from synthetic clothing. ""We know that there's microplastics in the air, we know it's all around us,"" said Laura Sadofsky, from the Hull York Medical School in the UK. Her team found polypropylene and PET (polyethylene terephthalate) in lung tissue, identifying fibres from synthetic fabrics. ""The surprise for us was how deep it got into the lungs and the size of those particles,"" she told AFP. In March, another study reported the first traces of PET found in the blood. Given the small sample of volunteers, some scientists say it is too early to draw conclusions, but there are concerns that if plastics are in the bloodstream they could be transported to all organs. In 2021, researchers found microplastics in both maternal and foetal placental tissue, expressing ""great concern"" over the possible consequences on the development of the foetus. But concern is not the same as a proven risk. ""If you ask a scientist if there is a negative effect, he or she would say 'I don't know',"" said Bart Koelmans, professor in Aquatic Ecology and Water Quality at Wageningen University. ""It's potentially a big problem, but we don't have the scientific evidence to positively confirm what are the effects, if any."" One hypothesis is that microplastics could be responsible for certain syndromes that weaken human health. While scientists have recently identified their presence in the body, it is likely that humans have been eating, drinking and breathing in plastics for years. In 2019, a shock report by the environmental charity WWF estimated that people are ingesting and inhaling up to five grams of plastic per week — enough to make a credit card. Koelmans, who contests the methodology and results of that study, has calculated the amount is closer to a grain of salt. ""Over a lifetime, a grain of salt per week is still quite something,"" he told AFP. While health studies on humans have yet to be developed, toxicity in certain animals reinforces concerns. ""Small microplastics invisible to the naked eye have deleterious effects on all the animals that we have studied in the marine environment, or on land,"" said Ghiglione. He added that the array of chemicals found in these materials — including dyes, stabilisers, flame retardants — can affect growth, metabolism, blood sugar, blood pressure and even reproduction. The researcher said there should be a ""precautionary"" approach, urging consumers to reduce the number of plastic-packaged products they buy, particularly bottles. However, ""people cannot stop breathing, so even if you change your eating habits you will still inhale them,"" said Koelmans. ""They're everywhere."" Earlier this year, the United Nations began a process to develop an internationally binding treaty to tackle the global plastic scourge. It has warned that the world is facing a pollution crisis to match the biodiversity and climate crises. Some 460 million tonnes of plastics were used in 2019, twice as much as 20 years earlier. Less than 10 percent was recycled. Annual production of fossil-fuel-based plastics is set to top 1.2 billion tonnes by 2060, with waste exceeding one billion tonnes, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said last month."
Symrise blurs chromatography analyses to protect their fragrances,"Until now, perfumers had few other solutions than secrecy to protect their creations, which are not covered by intellectual property laws. However, this protection had become quite illusory in front of the growing improvement of analysis technologies, in particular gas chromatography, that make it possible to quickly display the chemical composition of a formula. Actually, the creation of an original fragrance is a long and meticulous process that requires different skills, a lot of time, and many tests. The process is expensive and counterfeiters - which are quite numerous in the luxury industry - avoid such huge investments by pirating the work of original creators. As a result, perfumes and cosmetics are among the most counterfeited products in the world! At European level, seizures of counterfeit perfumes and cosmetics represent nearly 10 billion euros, almost 10% of the cosmetics market [1]. To protect the creative work of their perfumers and the investment of their customers, Symrise initiated in 2018 a program to protect scented formulas by blurring the results of gas chromatography analyses regarding fragrance ingredients. Developed by Symrise's R&D team in consultation with their perfumers, this technology is based on an innovative, colourless and odourless universal base, that helps to protect the originality of the perfume in which it is used. It contains a mixture of specific raw materials, with excellent UV resistance and temperature stability, that induce a wide range of interferences during a gas chromatography analysis. By blurring the quantification and identification of certain raw materials contained in the perfume formula, the base makes much more difficult to identically reproduce a specific fragrance. Finalized in 2019, the Cryptosym technology has already been applied to 45 formulas developed by Symrise for different olfactory families. Chromatography analyses showed that out of 133 natural and synthetic ingredients tested, the technology induces a variation in the analysis results for 118 of them: 93 being difficult to quantify, 25 being difficult to identify. In the main, according to Symrise, 40% of tested raw materials were affected by Cryptosym and 29% of them were completely ""encrypted"" by the technology. ""Cryptosym is a revolution in the sector because until then nothing had yet been developed to protect the intellectual property of the perfumer's creativity"", underlines Aliénor Massenet, senior perfumer at Symrise. ""With Cryptosym, copying a perfume is now more difficult, the process is much longer and without any guarantee of finding that little extra that makes all the difference between success and simple reproduction"" To date, Symrise continues researches to collect additional data but already offers the technology as an option to their customers."
Recommendations on sun protection still insufficiently followed,"During the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Congress, which has just ended in Slovenia, Pierre Fabre unveiled the results of its 'Sunscreen Assessment Family Experience (SAFE)' study [1], which was conducted among 8,000 adults — parents and grandparents — in seven countries around the world during the summer months. And it is clear that adults and children are still not following health recommendations for sun protection. Last year, at the height of the summer season, only about one-third of children received adequate sun protection while exposed during the hours of the day when the sun is at its strongest/ This figure drops to 13% for the adult population. And this isn't the only recommendation that many don't follow. While health professionals recommend applying sun protection at least every two hours during the periods of sunshine when risk is considered highest — between 11am and 5pm — only 18.5% of children have actually benefited from such assiduity. ""Between 50 and 80% of cumulative exposure occurs during early childhood and is the leading cause of most skin cancers,"" outlines Dr Ariadna Ortiz Brugués Medical Directorate at Laboratoires Dermatologiques Avène. However, the study shows that 32% of children had at least one sunburn during the summer; the average number of sunburns was two. These behaviours could be explained by a lack of information on sun protection, as well as by certain misunderstandings that are clearly enduring, despite the prevention campaigns conducted each year. Nearly one out of two people surveyed (45%) admitted not knowing that UVB rays cause sunburn, 27% didn't know that UVA rays accelerate skin aging, and more than a fifth of respondents are convinced that clouds protect from the sun. However, these numbers could soon change dramatically for the better considering that many children take the matter seriously. Nearly 47% of them said they would apply sunscreen without the help of their parents. This is true in all the countries surveyed, from France (41%) to the United States (54%), as well as Spain (nearly 52%) and Germany (nearly 46%). And generally speaking, the youngest respondents showed that they were aware of the issues surrounding sun protection, up to 70%."
Dutch scientists find microplastics in human blood for the first time,"The tiny and ubiquitous pieces of mostly invisible plastic have already been found almost everywhere else on Earth, from the deepest oceans to the highest mountains as well as in the air, soil and food chain. However, it is the first time that their presence in human blood has been demonstrated. A Dutch study [1] published in the Environment International journal on Thursday examined blood samples from 22 anonymous, healthy volunteers and found microplastics in quantifiable quantities in 17 of them (nearly 80 percent). Half of the blood samples showed traces of PET plastic (polyethylene terephthalate), a widely used substance globally, in particular to make drink bottles. More than a third had polystyrene, commonly used to produce disposable food containers and many other products. PE (polyethylene) and PMMA (poly methyl methacrylate) were also detected and 23% and 5% of the samples, respectively. The mean of the sum concentrations for each donor was 1.6 µg total plastic particles/ml blood sample. ""This is the first time we have actually been able to detect and quantify,"" such microplastics in human blood, said Dick Vethaak, an ecotoxicologist at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. ""This is proof that we have plastics in our body — and we shouldn't,"" he told AFP, calling for further research to investigate how it could be impacting health. ""Where is it going in your body? Can it be eliminated? Excreted? Or is it retained in certain organs, accumulating maybe, or is it even able to pass the blood-brain barrier?"" questioned the scientist about the plastic in human body. The uptake routes of plastic particles detected in human bloodstream are likely to be via mucosal contact (either ingestion or inhalation). Dermal uptake of fine particles is unlikely except if the skin is damaged. The authors of the study therefore said the microplastics could have entered the body by many routes: via air, water or food, but also in products such as hygiene or cosmetic products (toothpastes or lip glosses, for instance) or tattoo ink. Furthermore, ""it is scientifically plausible that plastic particles may be transported to organs via the bloodstream,"" they added. The study was funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development as well as Common Seas, a UK-based group aimed at reducing plastic pollution. Alice Horton, anthropogenic contaminants scientist at Britain's National Oceanography Centre, said the study ""unequivocally"" proved there was microplastics in human blood. ""This study contributes to the evidence that plastic particles have not just pervaded throughout the environment, but are pervading our bodies too,"" she told the Science Media Centre. Fay Couceiro, reader in biogeochemistry and environmental pollution at the University of Portsmouth, said that despite the small sample size and lack of data on the exposure level of participants, she felt the study was ""robust and will stand up to scrutiny"". She also called for further research. ""After all blood links all the organs of our body and if plastic is there, it could be anywhere in us."""
Shiseido unveils new testing method to accelerate skin bacteria analysis,"According to Shiseido, the methods currently available to analyze the bacteria that are present on the skin of an individual (the so-called ""skin microbiome"") make it hardly possible to obtain results in last than one month after having collected the samples. With the aim to provide customers with a new high-value in-store experience and beauty service, the group has partnered with Yamato-Esulon and Orcoa, two Japanese manufacturers of laboratory equipment that have developed devices that are able to detect periodontal disease bacteria. The link between skin health and beauty and the 1,000+ types of indigenous bacteria that can be present at the surface an within the skin is still to be fully investigated. However, Shiseido has found in earlier research that indigenous bacterial diversity is low in sensitive skin and that some prebiotic ingredients can improve skin texture and hydration. While, the skin microbiome can vary a lot from one individual to another, Shiseido chose to focus on Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes, two types of skin bacteria that are said to be strongly ""related to the beauty and health of the skin."" Using a compact and simplified PCR [1] testing device, the Japanese cosmetics giant was able to develop a fast testing method for these two strains. The new method enables any person without specific skill to perform the test and obtain the results in about 40 minutes. According to Shiseido, analyzes confirmed the amount and balance of the bacteria assessed with the new methods were equivalent to the results of those being examined with a conventional method [2]. Thanks to its compact size, the device can be placed in any venue receiving customers. Beauty advisors just have to collect samples from the customer's stratum corneum, usually from the forehead, and the results can be delivered within less than an hour, providing customers with a unique shopping experience. As a first step, Shiseido plans to launch a ""unique skin bacteria"" measuring service using this testing method on a trial basis for visitors at the Shiseido Global Innovation Center (called ""S/PARK""), a research and innovation hub located in the Minato Mirai area in Yokohama, Japan. ""With this technology, we wish to offer opportunities for our customers to deepen their understanding of indigenous skin bacteria, which play an important role in the beauty and health of the skin. Furthermore, by combining with the advanced counseling services of our beauty consultants, which are one of our strengths, we would like to provide people with optimal, personalized skincare solutions according to their current skin conditions,"" said Shiseido in a statement. The Japanese group plans to further develop these technologies to gain a deeper understanding of the human skin ecosystem in which cells and microbes coexist and how to provide beneficial services to its customers."
"Microbiome, fermentation: 2022 sheds a new light on bacteria!","Advances in medicine have made us aware of the dangers of bacteria which can cause strep throat, gastroenteritis or cholera. But most bacteria are far from being pathogenic, and some of them can actually be beneficial to our bodies. There would be a thousand billion species of microorganism out there, compared to just 10 million animal species. They are absolutely everywhere: in the air, in the ground, in the water. Measuring between one and 10 microns, these unicellular organisms ""regulate ecosystems, modulate the flow of carbon and nitrogen, produce half of the available oxygen, form symbioses with all living things, protect against pathogenic microbes, facilitate the absorption of nutrients, inform the immune system and regulate a number of physiological parameters,"" writes the French bimonthly magazine ""Socialter,"". And for some time now bacteria are being cultivated to address new needs and even to help us reduce our environmental footprint. The tide perhaps began turning with talk of microbiota. Suddenly, it was all the rage to take an interest in the inner life of our intestines and those microorganisms that populate our guts, without which we would experience bloating, flatulence or seriously disturbed digestion. Bacteria, which are the basis of the fermentation processes, have given new life to foods such as yogurts, pickles, or sauerkraut. During the fermentation process, microorganisms consume the sugar and water contained in the food. By multiplying, these microscopic living beings change the taste, as well as the texture and even the colour of a food. They are also able to boost food content of vitamins B and C, as well as zinc and iron, and even make proteins more digestible. Last summer, US researchers from the Stanford School of Medicine discovered that following a diet enriched with fermented foods for 10 weeks increased the diversity of the microbiome, and that it was even possible to help maintain weight, and reduce the risk of diabetes and cancer, as well as cardiovascular disease. Up to six such foods should be eaten to enjoy the benefits. Actually, bacteria have become indispensable to our diets, as fermented products make up 5 to 40% of the human diet, depending on the culinary culture. Five years ago, a study by BIS Research estimated that the market for fermented foods could be worth $888.76 billion by 2023. And, for several years now, manufacturers have been working on food innovations populated with ""good"" bacteria. Take the pickle juice developed specifically for athletes by the American brand Pickle Juice Company, presented at the SIAL international food innovation show in Paris in 2018. Or the Korean brand Ligaro, which transformed its kimchi — an iconic K-cuisine staple based on cabbage and chilies — into jam! But these microbes aren't just doing good things to food. They are now increasingly being used in anti-wrinkle creams, moisturizing serums and other products in the beauty toolbox. Cosmetic brands have realized that the fermentation process could be useful in this sector: letting these microscopic organisms proliferate supposedly helps obtain a better concentration of nutrients and antioxidants. In fact, active ingredients are reportedly boosted by the fermentation process. As such, in a recently published report, US market research firm WGSN naturally bet on fermented beauty as a trend that will boom in 2022. Bacteria are one of the main drivers for the development of biotechnologies with almost infinite applications. Recently, researchers in Quebec have been working on molecules produced by bacteria that can kill... other bacteria. This breakthrough could very well take the form of a future soap. This new-gen version would replace the current detergents or hand sanitizers… Bacteria can also help turn greenhouse gases into bottles for shampoos or ethanol for perfumes, or even luxury glasses, bags, and sleeves for smartphones and laptops."
Could turmeric be a key ingredient in future sun protection products?,"While health specialists do reiterate the importance to use an effecient protection against UV in the event of prolonged sun exposure, the demand for more natural sunscreen products is also rising among consumers, as for all personal care categories. This is a problem that brands have taken on board, gradually adapting their formulas to meet the expectations of consumers while offering the highest level of protection possible. But that hasn't stopped scientists from continuing to search for potential new natural molecules, which could protect the skin even more effectively against the harmful effects of ultraviolet rays. A recent study [1] has brought to light an unexpected ingredient that could do just that, and in so doing contribute to the fight against skin cancers, which have been on the rise over the last few years, as well as against photoaging: turmeric. Turmeric is already known for its antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and healing properties, which help in the fight against eczema and psoriasis. It is, more particularly, one of its molecules, curcumin, which proves to be an interesting aid for several skin problems. And it is precisely this active ingredient that American researchers have paid attention when seeking out the sun filter of the future. Conducted on rodents, their study confirms the anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin on the skin, and highlights ""its potential as a photoprotective adjuvant when delivered through nanoparticles."" A process intended to overcome some limitations of curcumin observed by researchers in previous studies, including its low aqueous solubility and rapid degradation in vivo. The substance is still far from being incorporated into everyday products. However, in view of these encouraging primary results, the scientists now wish to go further to determine whether the active molecule could be used as a sun filter. In an interview with Dermatology Times, Adam J. Friedman, a professor at George Washington University, who participated in this American study, is enthusiastic about these results and already sees the potential of curcumin, although the research is not yet at an advanced stage. ""Ideally this would be incorporated into a sunscreen or a moisturizer that would be used in conjunction with a sunscreen,"" explains the scientist, who believes that another formulation would be possible as a ""do-over"" — meaning when you have forgotten to put on sunscreen. Curcumin also seems to have a bright future in many applications, if this researcher is to be believed. ""Today there is growing scientific evidence suggesting curcumin's utility in the treatment of chronic pain, osteoarthritis, and inflammatory dermatoses such as psoriasis; acceleration of wound closure; and bacterial, fungal, and viral skin infections, as well as cosmetic ailments such as dyspigmentation,"" he outlines."
Study: Sulforafane may be helpful in the fight against hair loss,"Sulforaphane could not only become an unmissable ingredient in hair care cosmetics, but even an alternative pharmacological treatment for androgenetic alopecia, of which baldness is the ultimate stage. This is the finding of a team of scientists from South Korean company Gragem Co. Ltd. and of the Department of Biotechnology at The University of Suwon. Published in the journal Cosmetics, the results of the study [1] showed that the organic compound present in broccoli and cauliflower induced an increase of nearly 7% in the number of hairs in participants suffering from androgenetic alopecia. The researchers developed a prototype formulation of four ingredients — dexpanthenol, biotin, L-menthol and sulforaphane — to conduct a clinical application test in men and women aged 18 to 54 with androgenetic alopecia. The goal was to determine if the gel in question was able to relieve the symptoms of hair loss after 18 weeks of use. Even before they began their trial, the scientists knew from previous studies that sulforaphane increased the expression of the enzyme that breaks down dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the hormone implicated in hair loss, thereby helping to inhibit hair loss in the animal model. All that remained was to test the effect on men and women and report the results. The clinical study, which was conducted on 23 patients thus showed that ""parietal lines and bangs visually improved and the number of hairs increased by 6.71% from before using the test product to 18 weeks after using the test product."" The research works ""strongly suggest that sulforaphane may be an active ingredient that significantly alleviates hair loss symptoms,"" the authors of the work write… In parallel, in vitro studies on the behaviour of specific cells also allowed the researchers to show that sulforaphane enhances the mRNA and protein levels of Akr1c2 and Dhrs9 in the cell cultures of RAW 264.7 macrophages without cytotoxicity. At a time when natural ingredients are taking precedence over synthetic ingredients derived from oil resources, it would not be surprising to see the emergence of new shampoos, conditioners and other masks based on broccoli, cauliflower and other vegetables rich in sulforaphane, such as brussels sprouts."
BASF and Givaudan get OECD approval for first animal-free toxicology testing,"After more than 10 years of collaboration, BASF and Givaudan have received OECD approval on an animal-free testing strategy that can be used to predict whether a substance may cause allergic reactions in the skin. ""We have taken a big step forward. Now we can also use alternative methods to answer more complex toxicological questions without animal testing,"" said Dr Robert Landsiedel, Vice President, Special Toxicology at BASF. Before a new product is approved by the authorities and placed on the market, numerous tests must be carried out. This includes testing whether the product sensitises the skin. However, since 11 March 2013, European regulations have banned animal testing for cosmetics purposes including for repeated-dose toxicity, reproductive toxicity, and toxicokinetics, irrespective of whether there are alternatives. Since then, various in vitro methods - usually based on cell-cultures - have been developed to replace animal testing in the identification of skin sensitizers [1]. The new toxicology testing strategy, a ""world's first"" according to BASF and Givaudan, comprises three alternative methods that enable to get rid of animal testing to predict whether a substance causes allergic reactions in the human skin. ""To assess skin sensitisation, which is caused by a complex process in the organism, we need a combination of three methods,"" Landsiedel explains. ""This strategy has a better predictivity for human allergy risks as compared to traditional animal testing,"" added Dr Andreas Natsch, head of in vitro Molecular Screening at Givaudan. In addition to this toxicology testing strategy, BASF and Givaudan have also received OECD approval for another new alternative method, the so-called Kinetic Direct Peptide Reactivity Assay (kDPRA), which enables researchers to predict how intense an allergic reaction is. It can complement the now approved toxicology testing strategy. In addition to assessing whether there is a skin sensitisation potential, the new method can add information on the potency. ""By demonstrating that results are reproducible and predictive, trust in replacements of animal tests is growing,"" adds Dr Roger Emter, who developed one of the underlying methods at Givaudan. The approval of this toxicology testing strategy has opened up the possibility of similar progress in other areas, such as eye irritation effects or effects on the hormone system. ""We haven't done it all alone, of course. Over the past 10 years, various companies and scientific institutions, such as the Institute for In Vitro Sciences (IIVS), have worked with us to validate the individual methods of the strategy,"" emphasises Dr Susanne Kolle, lab team leader at BASF. ""We have trained laboratories around the world on how to use these methods to generate accurate results,"" Kolle explains."
"Artificial blue light has negligible impact on human skin, says Beiersdorf","As the number of hours people are spending in front of laptops, smartphones, and TV screens has increased, particularly during the coronavirus pandemic, conjectures and concerns about the effect of these sources of artificial light on the human health have been rising too. The effects of the blue light from the sun are well known, this is why there is suspicion that the artificial screen variant might also damage the skin. However, such conclusion usually lacks of sufficient evidence, said Beiersdorf in a statement. ""Public discourse has been characterized by a lack of knowledge and of scientific studies. But through our research activities, we've managed to prove that the amount of artificial blue light emitted during conventional use of electronic devices is nowhere near enough to trigger harmful skin effects,"" explained Dr. Ludger Kolbe, Chief Scientist Photobiology at Beiersdorf. The Beiersdorf research team headed by Dr. Ludger Kolbe has investigated the subject of artificial blue light [1]. According to the German scientists, spending an entire week in front of a monitor uninterrupted at a distance of 30 cm from the screen would have the same effect on the skin as just one minute outside on a sunny summer day in Hamburg at midday. ""Compared to the emissions of the sun's natural blue light, those of artificial blue light are virtually undetectable. The effect on the skin is negligible, which means concerns about negative impacts on the skin are unfounded,"" added Kolbe. According to Beiersdorf, the discussions surrounding artificial blue light should not distract from the actual effects of natural blue light, which have been proven by many years of research. Indeed, visible light accounts for about 50 percent of solar radiation, one-third of which is natural blue light. It penetrates much deeper into the skin than UVA rays, which make up just 5% of sunlight. The Beiersdorf research team said their research has confirmed that high-energy visible (HEV) light generates oxidative stress, thus accelerating skin aging and increasing hyperpigmentation. However, considering the very low quantities emitted by electronic devices, the real problem is the sun's natural direct blue light. The same study has also verified the protective effect of antioxidant ingredients such as licochalcone A, which is used in several products from Beiersdorf, including nearly every Eucerin sunscreen products as well as in the Sensitive-Allergy and UV Face range of Nivea Sun products."
"""Clinical tests can also stimulate innovation in skin biology,"" Dr Nico Forraz","What do Cosmet'in Lyon Skin Science Days represent for the cosmetics industry? Dr Nico Forraz - This congress has been held every two years, since the association was founded in 1962. Its purpose is to highlight the latest scientific innovations and advances in skin biology. This is all the more important since skin biology is directly linked to dermatology and cosmetology. It is therefore a single opportunity to bring together all the players who contribute to innovative developments for skin care and well-being. What are the latest discoveries and emerging trends in skin biology? Dr Nico Forraz - These are precisely the subjects that will be discussed during the congress: the interaction between microbiota and human skin; environmental factors such as pollution, and their influence, in particular on the inflammatory status of the skin; advances in skin aging, linked to the lengthening life expectancy; the progress made in skin renewing, repairing and healing. We will also discuss new technologies, that are really making the bridge between clinical treatments and cosmetology, and tissue engineering also, which makes it possible to model cosmetic and aesthetic treatments. There is a lot to say! Why did you choose to focus on the impact of clinical tests on the skin biology mechanisms? Dr Nico Forraz - Traditionally, we start with discoveries made in the laboratory and then move on to clinical experiences. We wanted to address the subject from the opposite angle: by offering a review of the discoveries resulting from clinical tests and by demonstrating how they stimulate fundamental research and innovation in skin biology. How were the speakers selected? Dr Nico Forraz - The organizing committee, led by Nicolas Bechetoille [2] and Aurélie Pagnon- Minot [3], respectively Secretary and Treasurer of Cosmet'in Lyon, joined forces with academic researchers and industrial players, members of Cosmet'in Lyon. Together, they appointed session chairmen and proposed scientific, academic, clinical and industrial research key subjects, while providing a forum for young researchers. How does this knowledge guide and support the development of new products by brands? Dr Nico Forraz - Brands must both capture market trends and watch for scientific and technological innovations. It is the consideration of the whole that makes it possible to develop and validate the relevance and efficiency of future products. What types of products are more specifically concerned? Dr Nico Forraz - The cosmetic product becomes a preventive product, intended to maintain the balance of the skin, through a daily routine in particular. It aims mainly to fight against pollution, skin aging, to protect from the sun, to regenerate, to hydrate. These are the main demands that contribute to a healthy skin. What does these findings offer to consumers? Dr Nico Forraz - These discoveries offer consumers, innovation, efficiency, and security. Cosmet'in Lyon is very involved in these three aspects and wants to make this knowledge accessible to consumers. It is also preparing a mass market event that will take place in the Lyon area at the end of 2021, to explain how cosmetic products are developed. Then in early 2022, it will present the cosmetics industry, its structure and its business horizons to a high school audience. A booklet and a career forum relative to the beauty industry are in preparation. Education is at the heart of our mission, to bring together all stakeholders : academics, clinics, industry and consumers."
Study links frequent use of cosmetics to increased risk of endometriosis,"A chronic disease that can be disabling, endometriosis is characterized by ""the presence outside the uterine cavity of tissue similar to the uterine lining which will be affected by hormonal changes during each subsequent menstrual cycle,"" according to the EndoFrance association. Affecting one in ten women of childbearing age, the disease is most often responsible for chronic pain, but also in some cases of infertility. A team of researchers from the University of Granada and the San Cecilio Hospital in Granada has investigated the possible role of endocrine disruptors, substances capable of mimicking or blocking the natural action of hormones, in the development of endometriosis. ""Although the exact causes of its appearance are not known, a diverse range of factors are suspected of being involved, including genetic, epigenetic, and environmental causes , with hormones appearing to play a key role,"" explain Olga Ocón and Francisco Artacho, who worked on the study [1]. Concretely, the scientists sought to measure internal levels of various types of parabens and benzophenones [2], a series of substances that are suspected of being endocrine disruptors, in 124 women with and without endometriosis, recruited via public hospitals in the city of Granada, and collected information on each woman's use of cosmetics and beauty products. Verdict: the study reveals a link between the frequency of use of cosmetic and personal care products and high urinary levels of parabens and benzophenones. So far, there's nothing new, several studies have already established this kind of correlation. However, the Spanish researchers added that they also observed an association between high levels of parabens and benzophenones and a higher risk of endometriosis. These results add to those of another recent study, this time concerning the possible implication of bisphenol A (which is not a cosmetic ingredient) in the development of the disease. Based on the principle that it is still difficult to establish a diagnosis of endometriosis, and that there is no treatment to effectively cure the disease, the researchers warn of the need to implement preventive measures to reduce exposure to these various substances. In particular, it would be advisable to turn to beauty products that are free of endocrine disruptors. However, as endometriosis has complex and multifactorial origins, they point out that further studies are needed to corroborate these findings."
A model of 3D dermal microtissue to study the skin's elastic properties,"The French-based specialist in lipid chemistry and plant extraction, has developed 3D scaffold-free microtissues to mimic in vitro an elastic tissue, which is responsible for intrinsic elastic properties of the dermis. Indeed, explained Gattefossé in a statement: ""The 3D bioengineered skin substitutes currently available on the market are still defective models to study skin elasticity. Indeed, they contain exogenous and artificial matrices that bias the measurement of biomechanical properties in the reconstructed tissue"". When it comes to analyzing the biomechanical properties of the skin, the exogenous and artificial supports that serve as a matrix for these skin substrates bias any measurement. However, the deterioration of the organization and functionality of dermal elastic fibers is one of the main causes of age-related skin sagging, which makes them a preferred target for cosmetic anti-aging strategies. To develop the new advanced models, Gattefossé used the 3D scaffold-free spheroids, which takes advantage of the ability of cells to secrete their own extracellular matrix. This technology enabled Gattefossé to produce in vitro hundreds of 3D microtissues within a few days only using dermal fibroblasts aggregated in ultra-low affinity plates. To accurately evaluate the elasticity of such skin microtissues, and the efficiency of cosmetic active ingredients, Gattefossé relied on BioMeca's expertise and state-of-the-art technologies. The elastic modulus (or Young modulus) was thus measured using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and the elastic fibers were visualized by Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) imaging microscopy. Gattefossé and BioMeca thus demonstrated that the 3D spheroid microtissue is a relevant and reliable model with a complex organization, comprising a dense, mature elastic fiber network sufficiently extensive to mimic in vitro dermal elastic mechanics. ""Second Generation Harmonic microscopy highlights fibers network while Atomic Force Microscopy reveals tissue stiffness in both imaging and mechanically manipulating biological structures near physiological conditions overtime,"" underlined the co-Founder of BioMeca, Julien Chlasta. This investigative approach has been featured at the 31st IFSCC Congress, in Yokohama late in 2020. ""By combining two cutting-edge analytical techniques, i.e., second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM), we have been able to accurately correlate both the presence and amounts of elastic fibers with elastic properties of microtissues, thus evidencing that newly formed elastic fibers were functional,"" said Dr. HDR Nicolas Bechetoille, Skin Biology Research Manager at Gattefossé. This advanced 3D model has been used to measure the efficacy of EleVastin a novel active ingredient developed by Gattefossé, fighting against age related loss of skin elasticity. More to come in April 2021."
"Octocrylene in sunscreen products degrades into benzophenone, study","The ingredient, which is found in a variety of cosmetic and personal care products - including sunscreens and anti-aging skincare creams - breaks down into benzophenone, which accumulates rapidly as the product ages, demonstrated a team of French and American researchers in a study recently published in the journal Chemical Research in Toxicology [1]. Researchers from the Oceanological Observatory of Banyuls-sur-Mer (Sorbonne University, CNRS), in collaboration with their American colleagues from the Haereticus Environmental Laboratory in Clifford, Virginia, tested some fifteen sunscreen and anti-aging products purchased in France and in the USA. The products have undergone a 6 week accelerated stability aging protocol, equivalent to one year spent at room temperature. Then they were analysed using a high performance mass spectrometer. ""Initially, there is very little benzophenone in the products. But gradually as the product ages, there is more and more benzophenone,"" told Prof. Philippe Lebaron, co-author of the study, to AFP. Indeed, after subjecting the products to the accelerated stability method, the concentration in benzophenone strongly increased in the products. ""This is the first time the degradation of octocrylene into benzophenone has been demonstrated,"" added Pr. Lebaron. Benzophenone is associated with a wide range of toxicities, including genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and endocrine disruption. The substance is classified as ""possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B)"" by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the WHO. Noting that both octocrylene and benzophenone are easily absorbed through the skin, the researchers believe that octocrylene-based products, and therefore contaminated with benzophenone, can pose a threat to human health. Octocrylene is also suspected of being harmful to marine life, especially corals. Octocrylene can act as a metabolic toxicant in corals, potentially decreasing the resiliency of coral reefs to climate change, said the authors of the study. ""Some manufacturers have withdrawn it from their sunscreens for environmental reasons,"" notes Prof. Lebaron. The fact that products containing octocrylene may also contain traces of benzophenone is ""well known"" by cosmetics manufacturers, responded the French federation of beauty enterprises (FEBEA). According to the trade body, the safety assessment of octocrylene already takes into account the possible presence of benzophenone. Furthermore, the quantities measured in the study published in the the journal Chemical Research in Toxicology, ""always remain below the toxicity thresholds that guarantee products are safe to human health."" Actually, the main challenge regarding the use of octocrylene in personal care formulas might be to better purify octocrylene from its benzophenone contaminant before selling it to personal care product manufacturers and to develop stabilizing methods that prevent the formation of benzophenone. ""Our results did indeed demonstrate that the rate of benzophenone concentration increase depends more on the product formulation than on the initial octocrylene concentration,"" said the authors of the study. In any case, according to the FEBEA, human exposure to benzophenone, as described by the study, would not exceed 0.5 mg / day (when applying 18 g of sunscreen per day), which is three times less than the maximum tolerated oral dose. ""These traces of benzophenone therefore have no impact on health,"" concludes the organisation."
Silab tests its natural anti-acne active ingredient on a multifactorial model,"Most 3D models mimicking acneic skin do not take into account all of the four main components of this skin inflammation: hyper-seborrhea combined with a modification of the composition of sebum, colonization by Cutibacterium (C.) acnes, in particular the virulent phylotype IA1, hyperkeratinization and a secreted inflammation. ""Most 3D models mimicking acneic skin independently use hyperseborrhea or invasion by C. acnes to induce the characteristics of acneic skin,"" said Silab. However, as these two factors are inter-related at the early stages of the pathology, the French manufacturer of cosmetic active ingredients sought to develop a 3D model combining sebum alteration and invasion by C. acnes. For that purpose, a reconstructed epidermis was treated simultaneously with peroxidized squalene and C. acnes phylotype IA1 obtained from culture collection or isolated directly from acneic patients. The combination of these two factors induces acne-like keratinocyte responses, such as hyperkeratinization and inflammation, thereby providing a model exhibiting all the characteristics of acneic skin. ""The detailed characterization of this new in vitro model proves that it is totally suitable to mimic acneic skin and to be used as a screening tool for the development of acne treatments,"" explained by Marine Laclaverie, in vitro Innovation Project Leader at Silab. Once validated, this model was further improved by using different phylotypes of C. acnes strains specifically isolated from healthy and acneic patients. The 3D model resulting from this work has enabled the company to demonstrate the pharmacological activities of Acnesium, a natural active ingredient developed by Silab Softcare to treat the clinical signs of slight to moderate acne in adults. Produced from the pericarps of pomegranates (Punica granatum) from the orchards of the Tunisian Gabès oasis, Acnesium restores the homeostasis of acneic skin by targeting its four major components: it restores the homeostasis of acneic skin, it helps the activity of the sebaceous gland to return to normal, it controls colonization by C. acnes phylotype IA1, it has a keratolytic action and reduces inflammation by limiting keratinocyte sebocyte and lymphocyte inflammatory responses. The clinical efficacy of Acnesium was also demonstrated under control by dermatologists in a cohort of adult Caucasian patients suffering from slight to moderate acne. ""Combining rapidity of action and efficacy, this high-tolerance care product improves the general aspect of the skin and thereby patients quality of life,"" concluded Silab."
Amorepacific investigates blue light skin damages and how preventing them,"While the cosmetics industry recently focused on fighting the stress induced by the light emitted by the screens of our computers or smartphones, which has been identified as a circadian cycles disruptor and a factor of skin ageing, the scientific evidences substantiating the some claims were hardly abundant. However, a series of recent publications are progressively shedding the light on involved mechanisms and the best strategies to protect the skin from these insidious damages. In a research paper recently published in The Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology"" [1], a team of scientists at the Amorepacific R&D Center has presented a clinical evaluation method for blue light skin protection, a world first according to the Korean group. Blue light is a blue wavelength portion of the visible light spectrum ranging from 380-500 nanometres (nm). ""Blue light has the shortest wavelength and the strongest energy among all types of visible light, and prolonged exposure to this type of light is known to have harmful effects, such as sleep disturbance and damage to vision. Blue light can have detrimental effects on the skin as well, including skin pigmentation and reductions in skin elasticity and moisture,"" explains Amorepacific. However, while the potential impact of blue light and its mechanisms were well known, prior to Amorepacific's research there had not been any clinical research that had concretely measured the impact of everyday blue light exposure to the skin. Cho Hong-ri, a senior researcher of the Anti-Pollution Research Center in Amorepacific R&D Center, developed a blue light emitting clinical device that allowed the company to measure the effect of these waves on skin pigmentation and to assess the ability of various materials to protect the skin. Based on the minimal persistent pigment darkening dose (MPPD) determined from visual evaluation and melanin index measurements, Amorepacific developed a ""protection grade of blue light (PB)"" guideline. The Amorepacific's device produces blue light wavelengths similar to those modern people are often exposed to. By finely adjusting the intensity and time of light, the device makes it easier to conduct clinical evaluations mimicking the average exposure in daily lives. Using the clinical device, Amorepacific R&D Center showed that exposure to blue light with a wavelength of 456 nm causes skin pigmentation. Based on the finding, Amorepacific tested whether a blue light blocker developed and released by the company can actually prevent skin pigmentation. The assessment was based on the measurement of changes in melanin index values, and other data. The company was therefore able to demonstrate that an inorganic filter with titanium dioxide (TiO2) was efficient to prevent blue-light induced stress on the skin. Moving forward, Amorepacific plans to conduct further research on environmental effects and the resulting changes in skin."
USCD and Silab show the importance of the skin microbiota homeostasis,"The role of skin microbiota, in particular opportunistic pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), in a variety of skin diseases is now well documented. More recently, studies reported an overrepresentation of the species Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) in the damaged areas of compromised skin. This common commensal bacterium of the healthy skin microbiota, which usually brings benefits to the host may also be involved in the compromised skin phenotypes. The objective of the work carried out in Dr. Gallo's team was to identify the role and mechanism of action of S. aureus and S. epidermidis in the pathogenesis of two inflammatory skin diseases: Netherton syndrome and atopic dermatitis. The results supported the existence of a pathogenic role for S. epidermidis in compromised skin, similar to S. aureus. The deleterious effects of these two species result from an interspecies communication through a sophisticated system known as quorum sensing. This system allows synchronization of proteases secretion specific of each bacterial population. These virulence factors exacerbate the alterations in epidermal barrier function and inflammatory phenomenon characteristic of Netherton syndrome and atopic dermatitis. Laura Cau, who was involved in the project at UCSD as part of scientific international volunteering funded by Silab, explains: ""These discoveries highlight the considerable influence of the interspecies communication within the epidermal ecosystem on skin health. They strengthen the understanding of the role of commensal microbiota in the development of inflammatory skin diseases"". It is possible that other microbial species could have a similar detrimental effect, including fungi such as Malassezia furfur. Thus, both Netherton syndrome and atopic dermatitis appear as complex diseases influenced not only by the genome of the hosts but also that of the multiple species colonizing the skin."
Masks can efficiently prevent coronavirus transmission at hair salon: study,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which released the report, said the findings added weight to universal face covering policies as a means of slowing the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The study is based on a specific case observed in a U.S. hair salon a few months ago. On May 12, a hair stylist (stylist A) developed respiratory symptoms at a salon in Springfield, Missouri and continued working with clients until May 20, when she received a positive test for the new coronavirus. Stylist A ignored medical advice to self-isolate after her test on May 18. A second hair stylist (stylist B), who had been exposed to the first, developed symptoms on May 15 and also continued working until May 20, when stylist A got her result. Stylist B tested positive two days later. At this point, the salon closed for three days for disinfection while Greene County health officials performed contact tracing, identifying a total of 139 clients seen by the two infected stylists. The rest of the staff were also quarantined for two weeks. During their interactions with clients, both stylists had worn masks: stylist A had worn a double-layered cotton face covering, while stylist B had worn either a double-layered cotton face covering or a surgical mask. But even when stylist A had symptoms, the two stylists interacted with each other while neither was masked in intervals between clients. All 139 clients were monitored for symptoms for the next two weeks, and testing was offered to all of them, to be performed five days after their exposure. None of the 67 who were tested were found to be positive, and none of those who refused testing reported symptoms over the next 14 days when they were sent daily text messages inquiring after their health. The customers were roughly gender balanced, and their ages ranged from 21 to 93, with the mean average 52. The overwhelming majority wore masks for the entire duration of their appointments, which ranged in duration between 15 minutes and 45 minutes. The clients mostly wore cloth masks or surgical masks, while about five percent wearing N95 respirators. Scientists believe that although large droplets emitted by people when they cough or sneeze are primarily responsible for spreading COVID-19, smaller droplets released during ordinary speech are also potentially dangerous. This is particularly important because people might spread the virus unknowingly in the two to three days before they develop symptoms, or a carrier in rare cases may never develop symptoms. The authors of the CDC report concluded: ""Widespread adoption of policies requiring face coverings in public settings should be considered to reduce the impact and magnitude of additional waves of COVID-19."""
Skinobs launches a new Preclinical Testing platform,"The new ""Preclinical Testing"" platform enables users to identify and select the most relevant testing methods depending on several criteria: – Test category: Analytical tests, Content-contenair interaction, Ecotoxicity and Biodegradability tests, Safety tests, UV tests, efficacy tests... – Claim: anti-ageing, anti-pollution... – Test support: cell cultures, 3D skin models... the various tests corresponding to his objectivation project and directly contact each test provider. A keyword search also simplifies the search. Like the clinical tests platform, the new tool is accessible free of charge and without business commission. ""It has been never been easier to identify the tests needed for your projects, thanks to the links Skinobs has made between methods and product claims, mechanisms of action and test solutions,"" says Anne Charpentier, Skinobs' founder. In particular, the platform offers a detailed vision on efficacy tests. Cosmeticians can thus find the laboratory that meets their test criteria based on: – Mechanisms of action: Acne, Adipocytes, Anti-Aging, Bioavailability, Skin Renewal, Free Radicals and Oxidation, Hydration, Inflammation, Biomechanical Integrity, Microbiota, Pigmentation, Pollution, Barrier Function, Regeneration... – Analysis of 80 biomarkers: cytokeratin, collagen, Metallopeptidases-proteases, interleukins, hyaluronic acid, integrins, Interleukins... – Quantitative and/or visual analysis methods: gene expression, histology (morphology and imaging), protein and metabolic analysis... – Choice of three levels of custom testing: custom protocol, 100% R&D studies and non-targeted ""omics"" tests. This extension strengthens the central position of the Skinobs platform within the cosmetics industry. It completes the clinical testing platform, which allows cosmeticians to identify relevant methods to support their claims for their active ingredients, finished products or medical devices including: tolerance tests, consumer tests, sensory analyses, efficacy tests on skin, hair or nails. In 2019, 1,700 users from 58 countries have consulted it, viewing more than 19,000 pages. ""The success of this unique tool has been built on a collaborative relationship with industry players offering a global view of testing to cosmeticians with more than 300 methods and more than 90 laboratories referenced worldwide,"" adds Anne Charpentier. To become comprehensive, the referencing of CROs is continuous to bring together, gradually, all the global partners specialised in the preclinical evaluation of active and finished products on the skin, sebaceous glands and hair. ""Our aim is to offer a comprehensive and independent tool, and we know the adventure is just beginning,"" concludes Charpentier."
Kao unveils age-related changes in the morphology of lips,"While the problems of young lips are well known, how lips and the lip area do precisely evolve during the different steps of ageing, remained to be documented. Actually, the most common problems affecting lips, dryness and chapping, tend to peak in the 30 somethings. For older women, other issues - such as dull colour, loss of fullness, and an increasing vaguely defined contour of lips - increase along with ageing. In a first part of the study, the researchers of Kao Corporation have analysed facial photographs of 139 Japanese women from 16 to 78 years of age. Results show that both the thickness of the upper and lower lips, and that of both together showed a decreasing trend associated with ageing. Furthermore, the width of the lips broadened with age and fullness of the lower lip shown in lateral views was significantly reduced. The study also found that the white upper lip area under the nose became extended with age. A more detailed investigation by age group showed these changes start around 40 years of age. According to Kao, this phenomenon is attributable to the effects of inner tissue changes and muscular drooping. In a second part of the study, Kao researchers enrolled thirteen Japanese women aged 46-55 years in 2015, then measured and compared various lip area sites in facial photographs taken in 1992, 2002, and 2015. Comparisons of measurements obtained in the same participants confirmed that with age the lips became extended horizontally and nose-lip distance was also increased. The study allowed Kao to get quantitative data on a phenomenon which was generally observed but scarcely measured. The way lips and the lips area change with age has been clarified and documented. According to the Japanese group, these findings will facilitate the development of new cosmetic and make-up products."
ScenTree: a collaborative classification of perfume ingredients,"When they created ScenTree, Maxime Baud and Thomas Espinasse, two young, recent ISIPCA graduates, had three objectives in mind: democratize knowledge on perfume ingredients, take the heat out of allergens, and promote the catalogue of raw material companies. To sum it all up, they offer educational material intended for independent perfumers and marketing services eager for communication data on ingredients and willing to take the heat out of this issue. A digital, interactive raw material bible Maxime and Thomas got the idea of setting up their own classification during their raw material olfactory sessions. To meet this challenge, they drew inspiration from Lifemap, a classification designed by Damien de Vienne, of Lyon University, France. Lifemap classifies all living organisms on Earth in the form of a tree along which you can ""move"", a bit like with a map. So far, two perfume ingredient classifications had been available: Champ des Odeurs, by Jean-Noël Jaubert (1983), and a more functional one by The Good Scents Company. As soon as they had got an agreement signed with Lifemap's creator, the two entrepreneurs applied his model to perfumery. Today, ScenTree lists 460 raw materials, two thirds of which are synthetic, the rest being composed of natural raw materials and a few bases. The two founders aim to classify at least 1,000 raw materials - a perfumer's palette contains about 1,500. Basically, ScenTree looks like a tree, where each semi-circle represents an olfactory family and includes a descriptor (there are 16 large olfactory families). Zooming on them unveils details about every ingredient, and there is also a search bar providing direct access to ingredients. However, although everyone agrees on the olfactory descriptors, their hierarchy remains subjective – olfaction itself is subjective. All this patient research work was based on reference books, but especially on experts', perfumers' and evaluators' feedback, in order to check the relevance of the information. Cinquième Sens, a partner of the young company, provides a room in their co-working area to host olfactory sessions. Six months after creating ScenTree, the two young entrepreneurs have set up a real structure: their association has become a company. But for it to last, a two-level, self-financing programme was implemented with sponsors, but also partners. As regards sponsors, the idea is to integrate the logo of the sponsoring supplier which markets the ingredient to the ingredient's ID card. The logo can be interactive and provide access to a complementary presentation drafted by the company. In addition, the sheet will display the ingredient's trade name used by the partner company as well as the Minimum Order Quantities (MOQ). As far as partners are concerned, the company aims to offer raw material companies and schools the possibility to provide more general communication material. To this aim, ScenTree will use social media, like Instagram and LinkedIn. Apart from this objective, ScenTree will publish a newsletter every other week including the latest updates on the website, cultural information on the perfume world, and information on the sponsors. At the end of the day, ScenTree is aimed to become the not-to-be-missed digital reference in terms of perfume ingredient classification, after Ernest Guenther's renowned The Essential Oils, first published in 1948."
Google Research team used machine learning to train AI to recognize smells,"Predicting the relationship between a molecule's structure and its odor remains a difficult. This problem, termed quantitative structure-odor relationship (QSOR) modeling, is an important challenge in chemistry, with a strong potential impact on the manufacture of synthetic fragrance, among others. A paper published on October 23, 2019, by a team of Google researchers tackles how machine learning can be used to find the relationship - which scientists have been trying to quantify for over 70 years - between a molecule's odor and its structure. While molecular structures can give scientists insight as to what something looks like or what it sounds like, ""predicting the relationship between a molecule's structure and its odor remains a difficult, decades-old task."" These scientists used machine learning to find this underlying quantitative relationship in a way reminiscent of how deep learning is used to predict visual and auditory characteristics. Using a dataset of 5030 molecules labeled with odor descriptors (like fruity, bready, nutty and cheese) by olfactory experts (like professional perfumers), the team trained a Graph Neural Network to predict these labels based on the molecule's shape. The perceptual and structural similarities of both local and global components of a molecule aided this neural network in recognizing which parts are responsible for which fragrance nodes. According to the paper, being able to use machine learning to predict odors based on their molecular structures would ""aid in the discovery of new synthetic odorants"" so that natural products don't need to be harvested in such high numbers. The latest trends and innovations in fragrance will be presented on November 7, 2019 at the Fragrance Innovation Summit in Paris. Program and registration: www.fragranceinnovation.com"
Kamax Innovative develops breakthrough method to assess cosmetic actives,"Founded in 2013, Kamax Innovative conducted research work in a university in partnership with CNRS to develop a unique optical imaging technology for which they hold exclusive licenses. ""We use polarization as an information vehicle to record contrasts and differences in the activity of a cosmetic product on the skin or hair,"" explains Jérôme Desroches, President and founder of the startup. Using the K-PROBE device, a next generation automated microscope, the XPolar technology accurately reads contrast differences and quantifies biological modifications on dermal collagen and hair keratin. ""We accurately monitor dermal collagen and measure the direct effects of stress factors, like UV rays or oxidation, which can appear on in vitro skin, or the chemical impact of colourants, for example hair colourants,"" adds Jérôme Desroches. Other than the new dimension of the results provided, the technology offers multiple key advantages. The sample does not get coloured like it does with the standard observation technique, which requires a visual marker likely to create a bias. With the XPolar test, the sample remains clear of any added substance, so the result is endogenous and more reliable. ""We observe a natural XPolar signature made possible thanks to light and demonstrate the activity of products in cosmetics without any particular sample preparation. In addition, our technique helps discover previously unknown actions. It goes beyond the standard technique,"" says Jérôme Desroches. Ultimately, this ""contact-free"" technology only requires a low-power optical laser beam and does not degrade the slides, which can be reused for additional tests. Then, it is all scanned and digitized with a fully digital device ensuring easier data sharing. Launched a year ago, the XPolar technology has already seduced testing laboratories through the services developed by Kamax. The comprehensive solution combining the imaging system and the image processing software solution is now offered to small and major cosmetics groups."
Study reveals the lifestyle factors affecting the skin microbiome,"The new epidemiology study [1] - a collaboration between Amway and Microbiome Insights - was recently published in the scientific journal mBio, and found that up to 20 percent of the variability of the bacteria on people's skin can be explained by demographic, physiologic and lifestyle factors. Through a survey of 495 individuals between the ages of 9 and 78, and by collecting over 2500 skin swab samples from four skin sites and the mouth, scientists have revealed that the most influential factors associated with facial skin microbiome composition include levels of skin porphyrins - fluorescent molecules synthesized by C. acnes, the bacterium involved in the development of acne — as well as age and the use of sun protection. For the skin inside the mouth, by comparison, ethnicity and smoking showed the strongest associations with its microbiome. The study also found different skin microbiome patterns that corresponded with chronological age and others that corresponded with facial wrinkles and hyperpigmented spots; the discovery of a bacterium called Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii and its association with aging skin is being touted as the first step toward understanding how this microbe could be involved in the mechanisms of skin aging. A patent is pending on this particular finding. Commenting on the findings, Dr. Pedro Dimitriu, Senior Director of Bioinformatics at Microbiome Insights, Inc., which collaborated with Amway on the study, said the research ""advances our understanding of why skin microbiomes are so different from person to person."" ""We know the environment outside the body influences the skin microbiome to some extent, but this study shows some of the lifestyle and host factors that shape it too."""
"""BioMeca puts Atomic Force Microscopy at the service of skin knowledge,"" Anna Drillat","Premium Beauty News - What is the link between mechanics of materials and the cosmetics industry? Anna Drillat - The startup was founded in 2016 by Julien Chlasta and Pascale Milani, both PhD in Biology. Pascale Milani was the first to publish an article about the use of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to measure the mechanical properties of growing biological tissues. She worked in collaboration with Marek Haftek [1] on atopic dermatitis. As for Julien Chlasta, he wrote a thesis on the influence of the extracellular matrix mechanical properties in a growing organ. They pooled their expertises to set up BioMeca, whose activities include AFM for measuring the skin's mechanical properties. Premium Beauty News - How can Atomic Force Microscopy improve our knowledge of the skin? Anna Drillat - AFM is a very high-resolution technique which helps us work at very small scales and study the structures of biological tissues, like the skin, while maintaining the physiological conditions. Today, the innovative approach developed by BioMeca makes it possible to explore the skin's 3D structure and obtain information about the mechanical properties of the tissue as a whole. In addition, we can study particular structures, like hair follicles, and focus on specific areas: the epidermis, to measure the cohesion between the cells, or the dermis, for example to get information about the organization of collagen, the density and thickness of fibres, their spacing, etc. Then, we make comparisons under various conditions after treatment with an active, or to address specific ages. Premium Beauty News - At the CED days in January 2018, Pascale Milani presented a study on the nano-mechanical properties of corneocytes. What sort of information can you get about the condition of the skin barrier? Anna Drillat - Atomic Force Microscopy makes it possible to screen the surface of a sample with a very thin tip and to measure the interaction forces between the tip and the sample: the higher the elastic module, the harder the sample. The study shows that the hardness of corneocytes provides information about their level of maturation, that, with age, mechanical constraints get stronger, and that they are reduced in case of atopic dermatitis. These measurements are used to evaluate the condition of the barrier function and diagnose sensitive skins or a predisposition to atopic dermatitis. Premium Beauty News - What other information can you get about the skin? Anna Drillat - We work on the main skin compartments, in particular the epidermis, the dermo-epidermal junction (DEJ), the dermis, etc. One of our AFM systems is coupled with an epifluorescence microscope, which helps determine correlations between the mechanical and molecular behaviours of a structure. We also have confocal microscopes, so we can complete our mechanical data with accurate fluorescence data to precisely determine the biological processes involved. We are now able to measure the impact of a stress, whether physical or chemical. Our customers are cosmetics players, but we also work for the oncology, phytobiology, and pharmaceutical industries. Thanks to our expertise, we make our customers understand the biological activity and provide them with a scientific interpretation of results. We provide quantitative data that can substantiate claims. Premium Beauty News - What about your prospects? Anna Drillat - There are many. What is important is that all our studies are carried out in vitro, ex vivo, and we keep trying to get as close as possible to in vivo."
Marie-Alice Dibon (1966 - 2019),"Marie Alice held a Masters in Industrial Pharmacy from the Industrial Pharmacy Institute of Lyon (IPIL) and a Doctorate in Pharmacy from the Institute of Pharmaceutical and Biological Sciences of Lyon (ISPB). She spent 15 years in France and the United States working for the beauty, pharmaceutical and medical device industries. She occupied various positions, from formulation to R&D mangement at Bourjois-Chanel, Beauty Naturally, Aroma Vera and Darja Lab. In 2000, Marie Alice founded Alice Communications Inc. a consulting company, servicing the biotech, pharma and beauty industries on business development, communication, regulatory and innovation, before establishing more recently The WonderLab, with the aim to promote innovation in beauty and support new product developments. Her experience ranged from product development to marketing, through regulatory affairs, business development and manufacturing. In recent years, she had been particularly instrumental in alerting and educating the industry on the major role of the skin microbiome. Many of the people who crossed her path have wished to share their memories here, and pay her a last tribute: Thierry Magnet, General Manager of Gattefossé France - ""In addition to being a passionate professional in the sphere of beauty and health, endlessly exploring the main scientific trends that would make tomorrow's cosmetic successes, Marie-Alice was also true in friendship and never missed an opportunity to reunite former university fellows, when her frequent flights across the Atlantic allowed her to do so. The many tributes to her memory that have been appearing on social media these past weeks highlight the imprint she will leave in our industry. Her friends will also remember her as a joyful, happy and passionate woman."" Marie Drago, founder of Gallinée - ""For me Marie Alice was really the cement of the cutaneous microbiome community. She succeeded in bringing together and encouraging direct competitors to collaborate in a unique atmosphere. She always delivered new and avant-garde insights. She was clearly passionate, but nonetheless realistic and idealistic and she really believed that the microbiome could change the industry for the better. And thanks to her we all think the same way"". Elsa Jungman, founder of Elsi Beauty - ""Marie-Alice was so brilliant and yet so approachable. When we met in October 2016 in Orlando she immediately introduced me to a community that I knew very little of, inviting me as a speaker to the Premium Beauty News conferences. I will dedicate my conference in Boston to her (an event she should have attended) and the one in Rotterdam in May."" Laurence Moulin, General Manager, CEW France - ""Marie-Alice was a member of the CEW. Many of us knew and appreciated her for both her professional and human qualities. She had a great talent in explaining with clarity and precision how the latest scientific discoveries would influence the future of beauty. Her speeches at the last two editions of the Journée de la Beauté organized by the CEW France had left us all, impressed and enthusiastic. She had also inspired us a lot and helped us for their preparation"". Pauline Gaillard, Marketing Engineer, Gattefossé - ""I was lucky enough to meet Marie-Alice and she will continue to inspire me throughout my professional career. This woman was a shining example of charisma and intelligence ... Marie-Alice had an idea every second on ten subjects at the same time and always with a remarkable, thorough and well-argued accuracy. She stood out in this sphere of beauty and never used artifacts but science to innovate, shift the lines and stir the mentalities ... We will miss her as will this entire profession."" Anne Charpentier, founder and CEO, Skinobs - ""With emotions I pay tribute to Marie-Alice Dibon, a woman of lively and elegant intelligence, authentic and passionate. Regularly we exchanged and I thank her for supporting me with regular and sustained encouragements. Pioneer of the approach of the Microbiome in skin care, she has marked in a singular way the world of Research and Innovation in cosmetics, in France and in the United States. She was always committed to connecting the experts and sharing her scientific vision of cosmetics trough her various articles, conferences and meeting."" Éva Lagarde, Sales and Marketing Manager, Premium Beauty News - "" We had the opportunity to work together for the preparation of a conference. She always had good arguments and what it took to defend her point of view, in a straight forward way."" Sandie Jaidane, Marketing, Communication & Sales Opérations EMEA - ""I met Marie-Alice when I was working for Beyond Beauty Paris. In 2007 I had created a series of European and American summits dedicated to natural cosmetics and Marie-Alice helped me build and animate the second edition organized in New York. It was an immediate professional and friendly match! She worked as quickly and efficiently as she spoke. Her keen mind, her relevance and her visionary side, coupled with a huge capacity for work immediately seduced me and we decided, later on, to build and animate together a plethora of conferences, round tables and summits. She was restless and she opened her whole network to me and loved to create synergies. Her thirst for learning, for understanding and analyzing everything and come up with something that would be of help to her relatives, the cosmetics industry and consumers, prevailed on the notoriety and authorship of her analysis. She liked to help and share the things she had discovered… all the things and right away, on every social media."" Kristel Milet, journalist, Premium Beauty News - ""I met Marie Alice 10 years ago, when she was contributing through her scientific experience, to the Beyond Beauty Magazine.

"""Bioprinting helps design more and more complex skin models,"" Sandrine Héraud, LabSkin Creations","Premium Beauty News - The area of skin substitutes seems to be growth-driving, in particular since animal testing was banned for cosmetic products and their ingredients in the European Union, in 2013. Sandrine Héraud - Indeed, the notion of mimicking the skin, our largest organ, which creates a junction between the internal and external parts of our bodies and offers multiple functionalities, is a broad, even endless topic. Since 2014, Labskin Creations has been creating increasingly sophisticated models derived from tissue engineering for the cosmetics, dermocosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries. Since the company was founded, we have been developing more or less complex, tailor-made reconstructed skins on which companies can perform efficacy tests on both ingredients and finished products. Our young company has already won many awards, like the Trophée Acteurs de l'Économie and Fast 50 Deloitte, in 2017. Premium Beauty News - At a symposium held by the European Centre for Dermocosmetology (CED) in January 2019, your company introduced a skin model that reproduces atopic dermatitis. What an original approach! Sandrine Héraud - Atopic dermatitis is an inflammatory chronic disease which affects more than one infant out of ten. We combined several approaches to develop an innovative model involving the use of cells derived from patients with atopic dermatitis and of lymphocytes. It is the first human in vitro model of atopic dermatitis with an immunity component. The immune cells migrate in the whole tissue and the model presents a pathological phenotype that mimics the altered skin profile in atopic dermatitis. It helps test actives and finished products designed to treat this pathology. Premium Beauty News - 3D printing is revolutionizing tissue engineering. Has Labskin Creations made progress in this field? Sandrine Héraud - Indeed, bioprinting is a disruptive technology which created a small revolution in the field of tissue engineering, compared to already existing approaches, which is the reason why we focused our developments on this area. Our work results from a very productive collaboration with Christophe Marquette's 3d.FAB teams specialized in 3D printing. Bioprinting has the advantage of creating highly complex tridimensional structures, very accurately, reproducibly, using an automatic process. Thanks to this approach, we can get a mature skin sample in 21 days, compared to 45 with an in vitro culture. In 2016, we registered a first patent for a complete skin model consisting of both the dermis and epidermis. Then, we added a hypodermis, based on stem cells from fat tissue. We can also enrich models with the vascular component, add skin annexes, like sebaceous glands, and pigment the epidermis with melanocytes. The cell components may be modulated for a personalized result, which offers our customers great flexibility. In the skin, there are more than ten cell components, and we want our 3D models to be as sophisticated as possible, by adding Langerhans cells or skin innervation. Also, we try to reproduce the undulated physiological shape of the dermo-epidermal junction, which is flat in existing models using conventional engineering methods. It is a big challenge for our teams. In addition, we got involved in the Bloc-Print collaborative project which gathers our company, 3d.FAB, and the Lyon Civilian Hospices, in partnership with the Directorate General of Armament. The idea is to use bioprinting to treat burnt soldiers directly on the battlefield. The cells extracted from the patient's healthy skin are integrated to our bio-ink, and then directly reprinted on the patient, thanks to a bioprinter fitted with an articulated arm. The project received several awards in 2018: the Prix de l'esprit d'entreprendre (award for the entrepreneurial spirit) and the Bref Eco Lab Meeting Trophy. Premium Beauty News - To you, what is the future of 3D models? Sandrine Héraud - The fact that we offer bioprinted 3D models helps us reach new customers. First, the complexity of the 3D models now available, thanks to bioprinting, offers us new development prospects. Then, this approach makes it possible to standardize 3D models, i.e. their reproducibility, in order to discover new actives. The cosmetics industry accounts for 90% of our customers, but the pharmaceutical and medical industries are also much interested in regenerative medicine applications."
Forever young: study uncovers protein that keeps skin youthful,"The prosaically named COL17A1 might not sound like a fountain of youth, but the new study suggests it does the heavy lifting when it comes to keeping skin intact and unimpaired. The protein works by encouraging cell competition, a key process to maintain tissue fitness. That effectively ""drives out"" weaker cells while encouraging replication of stronger ones. But ageing results in a depletion of COL17A1, as do familiar enemies of youthful skin, like UV radiation. And when that happens, weaker cells replicate, leaving the skin thinner, more prone to damage and slower to heal. The research recently published in the journal Nature [1] is based on investigations using mice tails, which share many of the same characteristics as human skin. After confirming the importance of COL17A1, the team decided to investigate whether they could stimulate the protein once it was depleted - effectively looking for compounds that could kickstart the anti-ageing process in skin. They isolated two chemical compounds - Y27632 and apocynin - and tested both on skin cells, with positive results. ""Application of these drugs to full-thickness skin wounds significantly promoted wound repair,"" the study said. The two compounds point to ways of ""facilitating skin regeneration and reducing skin ageing,"" the study added. In a review of the study commissioned by Nature, two professors from the University of Colorado said cell competition had previously only been studied extensively in fruit flies. The research ""provides evidence that healthy cells in mammals can also efficiently repopulate adults tissues, replacing unfit or damaged cells,"" wrote professors Ganna Bilousova and James DeGregori. And they said the research offered ""proof-of-principle"" that the two chemical compounds could combat ageing. ""Future studies are needed to determine the mechanisms of cell competition in other tissues, and to identify compounds capable of reversing ageing in other organs,"" they added."
Understanding intercellular communication in the skin tissue,"There are multiple modes of communication between cells, and they are quite complex. Two main pathways are highlighted: the direct mode, by physical contact, and the indirect mode, through an exchange of chemical messages between an epithelial cell and a recipient cell. Exosome communication is largely studied, in particular as regards cancer or healing. Jérôme Lamartine, of the LBTI Laboratory, raised the question of whether ageing may impact this communication. As for Dr Matthieu Talagas, of the Brest university hospital, he focused on the physical exchanges in the neuro-epidermal synapses. ""There are physical contacts between our neurons and each type of epidermal cell, in the form of excrescences, grooves, or keratinocyte tunnels,"" he said. Dr Kaori Inoue, of Japan's Shiseido Global Innovation Center, showed that the ATP and glutamate released after a mechanical stimulation act as mediators between keratinocytes and neurons. They contribute to maintaining the skin's homeostasis. To Professor Miroslav Radman, Director of the Mediterranean Institute for Life Sciences (MedILS) in Split, Croatia, tissue homeostasis plays a determining role in ageing. ""There are many communication channels in our tissues. Cell parabiosis results in a functional homogenization of the cells by offsetting the flaws in a cell using the other nearby cells, without removing the failing one."" In inflammatory phenomena, intercellular communication is stopped by the activation of extracellular proteases. Parabiosis is broken down and the newly isolated cells can then reveal dormant pathologies and accelerate cells' death. To study the intercellular dialogue, companies use more and more sophisticated skin models. Specific research work is focused on atopic skins. ""Our model combines a mode of communication related to an inflammatory condition with a physical disturbance of the barrier function,"" explains Pauline Rouaud-Tinguely, of Silab. As for LabSkin Creation, they developed a 3D model obtained from diseased cells enriched in immune cells. As he aimed to better reproduce human skin, Dr Christophe Marquette, of CNRS in Lyon, worked in partnership with LabSkin Creation on the 3D bioprinting of a complete skin model with three layers, including a functional hypodermis. These are promising prospects for a better understanding of how the skin works, but also for grafts intended for serious burn victims. Other presentations on the skin barrier and the epidermis or on the microbiota, fibroblasts, adipocytes, and endothelial cells completed the congress. Skin Science Happy Hour in Paris On April 1, 2019, as a prelude to the in-cosmetics Globa trade show, the European Dermocosmetology Center (CED) will organize an event dedicated to skin engineering and genomics.

Skin and hair science in the age of diversity,"Although Caucasian skin is still the mainstay of many scientific studies, changes in the global population are reducing its prevalence, including in the most developed economies. As Paul Matts, Research Fellow at Procter & Gamble, pointed out, ""in 2050, Caucasian skin will represent only 15% of skin categories, while high growth populations in Asia and Africa will be the majority. It becomes necessary to no longer consider Caucasian skin as central in scientific studies."" Such evolution is all the more necessary that the skin's main characteristics differ according to ethnic groups. For example, the study conducted by Procter & Gamble on 250 subjects from five different ethnic groups showed that Indians and Latinos had more wrinkles than other groups, but that the wrinkles of Caucasians were deeper and therefore more visible. Several companies have already taken into account the evolution of the distribution of ethnic groups and have adapted their models. Mauritius-based International Center for Pharmaceutical Development (CIDP), for instance, has developed an in vivo measurement system to assess the effect of pollutants on different skin types. ""Measurements have shown that pollution has greater effects on Caucasian skins than on African skins,"" explains Véronique Newton, R&D Laboratory Manager of the CIDP. For its part, BASF has developed an in vitro model reproducing the cell cycle of sebocytes and conducted a study that showed notable differences between sebocytes of Asian populations and African-American populations. Other topics on nails, hair and eyelashes have been dealt through this same multi-ethnic approach. In parallel to the congress and as in previous years, the SFC awarded several scientists for their work in skin or hair science. The young researcher's prize was awarded to Laura Sabatier of Paris-Sud University for her study demonstrating that the shape of the hair follicle is linked to the shape of the hair. The curlier is the hair, the more asymmetrical is the follicle structure. For his part, Dr. Marek Haftek, research director at the CNRS Lyon, scooped the SFC Award for all its lifetime work contributing to a better knowledge of the skin and its functions. In 2019, the Jean Paul Marty Days will be held on the theme ""Skin and age""."
Study links early puberty in girls to chemicals in personal care products,"Conducted by Kim Harley and Brenda Eskenazi, from the University of California, Berkeley, and published in the journal Human Reproduction, the study shows an association between certain phthalates, parabens and phenols and precocious puberty in girls. [1] Starting with the observation that girls are experiencing pubertal onset at progressively younger ages, study leader Professor Harley and her team analyzed data from 338 mothers and their children who were monitored from birth to adolescence. Researchers have enrolled pregnant women in 1999-2000. Mothers were mostly Latina, living below the federal poverty threshold and without a high school diploma. The mothers were first interviewed during pregnancy. The researchers then measured concentrations of a variety of chemical substances in urine collected from mothers during pregnancy and from children at age 9. Three types of substances were targeted: – three phthalate metabolites (monoethyl phthalate [MEP], mono-n-butyl phthalate and mono-isobutyl phthalate); – methyl and propyl paraben; – and four other phenols (triclosan, benzophenone-3 and 2,4- and 2,5-dichlorophenol). The three compounds cited above were present in 90 percent of samples, with the exception of triclosan (a type of phenol) which was detected in 73 percent of samples collected from expectant mothers and 69 percent of samples from the 9-years-old children. In parallel, pubertal timing was assessed among 179 girls and 159 boys every 9 months between ages 9 and 13 using clinical Tanner staging. The research found that girls prenatally exposed to these compounds are more likely to experience earlier puberty, and this risk is particularly high for the daughters of mothers exposed to monoethyl phthalate MEP concentrations and triclosan (TCS) and 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) concentrations. The researchers found that higher concentrations of MEP and triclosan in prenatal urine was associated with changes in the timing of children's development milestones. The higher the concentrations, the earlier puberty signs appear. A problematic situation in a context where the differences of exposure, within the women enlisted in the study, could vary from 1 to 20 according to the substances. Possible reverse causality Previous researches on rats (Bateman and Patisaul, 2008 and Rasier et al., 2006) have shown that phenols, parabens and phthalates might have endocrine disruptors effects. However, no studies have examined the effects of these substances on humans, both during the prenatal period and in the period before puberty. ""This complicates our comparison with other studies,"" explain the authors. The researchers also warn that their ""findings with peripubertal exposure to methyl and propyl parabens could reflect reverse causality if, for example, girls and boys who entered puberty early were more likely to use personal care products containing these preservatives compared to children entering puberty later."" Indeed, these chemicals are quickly metabolized and are found very quickly in the urine (in 24 to 48 hours). Therefore, one to two urinary measurements per developmental point may not accurately reflect usual exposure. The authors also mention another limitation of their study. The population which was observed is limited to Latino children of low socioeconomic status living in a farmworker community. The role of other environmental exposures, such as pesticides, cannot be excluded. Despite these limitations, the authors consider their study is methodologically strong, with a longitudinal design, measurements of exposure biomarkers during two critical windows of development. It ""contributes to a growing literature that suggests that exposure to certain endocrine disrupting chemicals may impact timing of puberty in children."""
Skin ageing mechanisms are increasingly better determined,"First, Marie-Thérèse Lecci, of the Grenoble university hospital, reiterated the clinical aspects of skin ageing. ""Skin ageing is influenced by two main factors: one is intrinsic and related to our biological clock, the other is extrinsic and depends on the sun, tobacco, pollution, our diet, and drugs."" The list of impacting criteria is long and completed by lifestyle changes. Recent studies conducted by Gattefossé showed that screen-related light stress slows down the cell metabolism and causes important damage on the ATP. Skin ageing can be followed up with ""-omic"" analyses, which help understand physiological mechanisms and identify relevant biomarkers. As Mathieu Hébert, of Laboratoire Hubert Curien, explained, contact-free, non-invasive volume imaging makes it possible to visualize the dermo-epidermal junction. ""We have also modelled an average face to characterize the ptosis phenomena based on spectral and hyperspectral imaging,"" he emphasized. The CEA evaluates rosacea and complexion radiance by Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy. Then, Catherine Bosser, of the Lyon École Centrale Laboratory of Tribology and Systems Dynamics (LTDS), suggested the SILT (Skin Index of Living Tissue) based on the elastin/collagen ratio calculation, for which a patent was registered. Scientific progress makes it possible to offer more and more, increasingly diversified cosmetic treatments to fight against ageing based on increasingly solid scientific work. Players in this field do not hesitate to invest in advanced research programmes to develop the best-adapted product. BASF collaborated with the Lyon Laboratory of Tissue Biology and Therapeutic Engineering (LBTI) on research related to the maintenance of skin elasticity. As for Gattefossé, they worked with the Grenoble CEA on UVA genotoxicity. Today, the trend is towards ageing well and wellness, as opposed to the cult of appearance. Yet, one can wonder whether it is actually necessary to offer women consumers ever-more innovative solutions against skin ageing. According to a study conducted by the Inter-University Laboratory of Psychology of the University of Grenoble-Alpes and presented by Anna Tcherkassof, ""out of 115 women aged 49 on average, 2/3 are satisfied with their own face, while 1/3 are not. They admit a face looks more attractive when it is perceived as young."" This argument will actually do to keep investigating skin ageing."
"Environment, light radiation, microbiota, and substantiation at the core of the IFSCC congress debates","The congress opening conference was focused on the impact of climate change. According to Dr Dick Notz, of the Max Planck Institute, ""Even if politicians deny it, the severity of climate evolution is real for scientists. Global warming is inevitable and the consequences on populations' living conditions will lead to habit changes, and of course, changes in cosmetic use."" The skin effects of the environment were much debated. Beyond pollution, the impact of the whole light radiation, from UV rays to infrareds, triggered many discussions mainly focused on IR and visible radiation, which increases the production of free radicals in Type IV-V Asian skins. ""Infrareds accelerate skin ageing and interfere in the regulation of genes involved in the dermal matrix functioning,"" explained Suyeon Lee, of Korean company SK Bioland. As for Reinhold Dauskardt, of Stanford University, he studied the skin's biomechanical changes under the effect of UV and IR exposure. Multiple innovations in terms of cosmetics analysis methods and claims substantiation were shared. Dr Émilie Munnier, of the University of Tours, France, combined Raman imaging with data analysis to set up semi-quantitative distribution maps of cosmetic actives in the skin with high spatial resolution. Ziwei Zhang, of the German University of Tübingen, used Raman Confocal Spectroscopy (RCS) to assess the impact of emulsifiers and of the formulation type on the stratum corneum lipid composition. Other non-invasive optical imaging methods were also introduced. The microbiota keeps generating considerable interest, with varied research work from skin model creation, taking into account the whole skin microbiota, to the study of the influence of antimicrobial peptides on skin quality. Patrick Robe, of Givaudan, presented an analysis of the microbiota taken from five different sites on 86 Caucasian women. 278 microbiotas were sequenced, in particular to highlight the sebum rate as a factor with a strong impact on microbial diversity. Lifestyle influence and hair care and decorative cosmetics innovations were also on the agenda over the congress three days. Next time, it will be held in Yokohama, Japan, in 2020, but in the meantime, the IFSCC conferences will take place in Milan, Italy, from September 30 to October 2, 2019."
Silab demonstrates the shift in skin microbiota of aging Caucasian skins,"After having analysed the skin's microbiota of a sample of Caucasian women [1], Silab's researchers have demonstrated its transformation with age. The advanced research teams of [the molecular biology pole of Silab's microbiota platform->http://www.premiumbeautynews.com/en/silab-unveils-recent-investments,13170] have collected skin‐swab samples directly on the forehead of two groups of Western European women with healthy skin: a group of younger women aged 21‐31 years and a group of older individuals aged 54‐69 years. The bacterial communities of the samples were then analysed, sequenced and compared. Bioinformatics analysis of the data showed that the distribution of the microbiota changes in the course of aging. The searchers have shown the overall microbiota structure was different between the two age groups, as well as high interpersonal variation within older individuals. Furthermore, taxonomic composition analysis showed both an increase in Proteobacteria and a decrease in Actinobacteria on the older skin. At the genus level, older skin exhibited a significant increase in Corynebacterium and a decrease in Propionibacterium relative abundance. The results of this researche have just been published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Applied Microbiology [2]. ""Previous studies on Asian women had shown a change in the cutaneous microbiota in the course of aging. Nevertheless, given that each population has a different microbial signature with its own lifestyle, it was of interest to the scientific community to decrypt the imbalances of the age-related cutaneous microbiota specifically in Caucasian women"" stated Romain Jugé, Silab's R&D Project Leader. According to Silab these results could become the basis to develop new approaches aiming to rebalance the skin microbiota, which is modified during the aging process. As a first step, the results of this in vivo modelling study led to the selection of panels of volunteers and the substantiation of Ecobiotys by metasequencing. Ecobiotys is a cosmetic active ingredient developed from the yeast Metschnikowia reukaufii, isolated from the nectar of the porcelain flower Hoya carnosa. Ecobiotys is precisely intended to rebalance the distribution of bacterial communities of mature skin by strengthening the skin's immune and mechanical barriers."
Australia scientists develop 'world first' melanoma blood test,"The scientists, from Edith Cowan University, said the new test could help doctors detect the skin cancer before it spreads through a person's body. ""Patients who have their melanoma detected in its early stage have a five-year survival rate between 90 and 99 percent,"" lead researcher Pauline Zaenker said in a statement. She added that survival rates fell to less than 50 percent if the cancer spread in the body. ""This is what makes this blood test so exciting as a potential screening tool because it can pick up melanoma in its very early stages when it is still treatable,"" Zaenker said. The research, published in the journal Oncotarget on Wednesday, included a trial involving 105 patients with melanoma and 104 healthy people. The procedure detected early stage melanoma in 79 percent of cases, the scientists said. Melanoma is currently detected using a visual scan by a doctor, with areas of concern cut out surgically and biopsied. Zaenker said the new process involved identifying autoantibodies a person's body produces in response to the cancer. ""We examined a total of 1627 different types of antibodies to identify a combination of 10 antibodies that best indicated the presence of melanoma in confirmed patients relative to healthy volunteers,"" she added. Cancer Council Australia chief executive Sanchia Aranda said the test would be important for high-risk groups, who have to undergo regular inspections of their spots and moles that can be difficult and time consuming. She cautioned that the test did not pick up other types of less deadly, but more common, skin cancers such as squamous cell and basal cell carcinoma. ""People need to be very aware of whether they've got sun damage or UV damage on their skin, and be alert to changes in any spots or moles,"" she told AFP. The scientists will conduct another clinical trial lasting three years to validate the findings, and hope to have a test that clinics can use after that. One in every three cancers diagnosed is a skin cancer, according to the World Health Organization, with Australia having among the highest incidences of melanoma in the world."
For its 20th anniversary COSM'ING celebrates the key role of biotechnologies in cosmetics,"""Bioinspiration"", or how nature has inspired men for thousands of years, was the recurring theme in the first morning. Examples included ivy, the plant that can cling on to walls by making a glue containing nanoparticles. One gram of this botanical glue makes it possible to stick one tonne! As for the Euplectella Aspergillum sponge, it makes a skeleton with ultra-flexible glass fibres at very low temperature under the action of enzymes… One of the most widely known applications of biomimetics is Velcro. It is inspired from plants fitted with hooks that help them have their seeds carried by animals. Biomimetics is not a new discipline: it started to emerge 20 years ago. Germany was the first country to take interest in it and to understand the usefulness of such an approach. As a matter of fact, it remains the reference country in this field. To Kalina Raskin, CEO of CEEBIOS, the national network of competencies created in 2004, ""The culture of biomimetics research is better structured in Germany, as researchers are very motivated and supported by the government. There are more than a hundred public research centres in the field of biomimetics and two major institutional research networks, BIOKON and KompetenznetzBiomimetik (KN), among the largest in the world. It is also the country that drove the drafting of the ISO TC 266/ISO 18458 standard. Switzerland is also very active. As for France, it has advantages thanks to the biodiversity of its territories. The issue of knowledge transfer from Biology to manufacturers is still a brake, though."" In France, as soon as 2007, biomimetics was considered as the figure of the next industrial revolution. In July 2018, on the request of the Ministry of Ecological and Inclusive Transition, CEEBIOS drafted a report on the state of biomimetics in France. [1] What's next, a biomimetics label? The next conferences revealed the vast spectrum of potential applications of biotechnologies in the field of cosmetics and all the new disciplines that will need to be mastered in the future: Big Data processing, high-density screening, 4D printing of tissues soaked with bacteria, omics… Many cosmetics players, suppliers, and brands draw inspiration from nature to produce actives or develop technologies. Pierre Fabre and Yves Rocher implemented eco-design strategies to produce innovative molecules. Deinove has been exploring the potential of extremophilic strains to develop a unique database (6,000 strains) and produce high-added value molecules like pure, colourless carotenoids. In 2018, a collaboration with Greentech resulted in the Hebelys anti-aging and protective active being placed on the market. A future launch is scheduled for 2019 with Oléos (Hallstar Group) for new oleo-actives. Evonik recently won the first prize at in-Cosmetics for their 100% biodegradable glycolipids obtained by fermentation from modified bacteria. Research on biosurfactants has been booming since the 2000s, as the number of publications and patent registrations literally exploded. Germany is the leader in this field, followed by the US and Asia, and Henkel is the biggest patent applicant. Lastly, since the congress took place in Brittany, marine biotechnologies were at the forefront (Biotechmarine, Roscoff marine station, Lessonia, Agrimer, Greensea…). It is a way for CBB Capbiotek, the congress organizer, to contribute to the economic development of the region, by putting in the spotlight Breton companies which innovate with biotechnologies. For example, Codif International developed a ""supervised"" screening method to identify biological pathways that remain unexplored in cosmetics. The Biogenouest laboratory has been working on the automation of metabolomics data processing in order to process Big Data. The platform on Workflow4metabolomics.org helps build up, execute, and share data flows online. The perfume segment is also interested in the production of new, increasingly renewable and biodegradable molecules to provide perfumers with a diversified palette. This bioeconomy has become a field of interest for perfumery and aromas. All these conferences help understand the challenges of the great potential of biotechnologies for beauty manufacturers. Whether of marine origin or not, they represent an alternative to our industrial past for a greener future in line with society's expectations."
"""Authenticating raw materials is a strategic issue"", Patrick Jame, Institute of Analytical Sciences","Premium Beauty News - You are specialized in analyzing and controlling products, in particular on the isotopic level. Patrick Jame - Indeed, ISA is one of the greatest European laboratories in the field of analytical sciences. It gathers over 170 people. Isotopic analysis is based on the measurement of the isotope concentration, compared to the element: for example, the quantitative measurement of the 13C/12C ratio. It helps provide scientific data to recognize or authenticate certain products as regards their origins: synthetic or natural, animal, or plant origin. Isotopic analysis may also be used to determine the content in biosourced elements, i.e. to verify a compound is actually based on sustainable and renewable biomass and differentiate it from a compound based on petroleum products. Among others, it is used to analyze pure compounds (raw materials of interest), because it is a low-cost, quick method – it takes about ten minutes. Premium Beauty News - What compounds do you work on the most? Patrick Jame - In the field of cosmetics, we were pioneers in determining the animal or plant origin of squalane, as we developed an isotopic analysis method which, as far as we know, is the only existing method to control this substance right now. The Bloom NGO conducted a study in 2015: they revealed that out of 72 cosmetics creams tested, one out of five contained shark squalane. However, the vast majority of creams sold in Europe are plant-derived. The isotopic analysis of squalane is regularly requested to our laboratory, because major cosmetics brands are willing to verify their supply sources. Our customers are European, but also Asian. We are a global reference in this field. We provide a result, but above all, we commit to provide recommendations and a conclusion. Premium Beauty News - What are the limits of this method? Patrick Jame - If used to authenticate the origin of squalane, isotopic analysis only denounces fraud beyond 10%. It depends on the natural variation and measurement uncertainty of the instruments. Premium Beauty News - Do you work for other areas of application? Patrick Jame - We do, we have an isotopic database of over 2,000 compounds. We work for industries like health, the environment, and materials – for compliance follow-up and potential fraud detection issues. The organic sector is also interested in our work."
"""Optics offer a strong innovation potential for cosmetics"", Mathieu Hébert, Institut d'Optique Graduate School","Premium Beauty News – Could you describe the innovation potential associated with optics and the study of coloured surfaces? Mathieu Hebert - At Institut d'Optique, we focus on products with a visual functionality and on their appearance. We endeavour to describe and understand perception attributes with physical or mathematical models describing colours, shine, textures, or transparency. We explore how light is reflected by the material with macroscopic approaches. For example, we are among the first in the world to have studied prints seen not only through reflectance, but also through light transmittance, which was what I focused on for my 2006 thesis at the Federal Polytechnic School of Lausanne, Switzerland. It also led to several publications. [1] This work is aimed to enhance the control of appearance, but also to invent new visual effects. It represents a strong innovation potential. Appearance is a deep societal concern: Man tries to optimize His own visual quality and that of His products. Premium Beauty News - Which measuring instruments do you use? Mathieu Hébert - We use standard measuring instruments like spectrophotometers, gonio-spectrophotometers, spectral imagery, polarized imagery, but also cameras. With our engineering and Master's students, we can develop specific devices, for example to evaluate the translucency of a 3D printing material. Our work is based on measurement, modelling, and prediction, and we favour measuring methods that are easy to use, as well as the simplest mathematical models, so they can subsequently be used in the industry. As an example, in the field of printing, instead of measuring a broad sample of over 2,700 colours on a given material, as the best printing houses still do, mathematical models only measure a small sample of about forty printed colours and predict all the others. This is a strong advantage when you have to repeat the operation for another material. Premium Beauty News - What are the specificities of cosmetics? Mathieu Hebert - Visual functionalities are essential in the field of cosmetics, and it is based on very specific materials. For example, our hair is not a flat surface. Also, it does not have only one colour, but a mosaic of narrow coloured areas. Its small scales produce different reflections, one of which is produced on the scale surface and provides the sensation of shininess. The other is produced inside the scales and is usually coloured due to interferential effects. The regularity of the scales has much influence on these reflections, i.e. on our perception of our hair condition. As for the skin, it is a living, translucent, rather heterogeneous material. It can only be studied in reflectance, because it is not possible to position any instrument behind it, contrary to what can be done with paper or textile. Its translucency, in particular as regards red light, also makes it difficult to make measurements, since most spectrophotometers are not adapted to translucent surfaces. That is when spectral imagery represents a good alternative, although it is still a laboratory instrument. Premium Beauty News - What issues do you study for the field of cosmetics? Mathieu Hebert - We have been working on predicting the colour of skins wearing makeup, knowing the characteristics of the bare skin and the makeup applied beforehand. We also follow up the evolution of colours over time. In partnership with the Lyon-based Newtone Technologies company and the Hospital of Saint-Étienne, we have been directing a thesis on the 3D spectral imagery of the face, which actually got the best paper prize at the San Francisco Material Appearance conference in February 2018."
Could graphene sparkle a new era for hair dyes?,"Professor Jiaxing Huang and his team of researchers at Northwestern University (Illinois) recently published a report [1] suggesting that a material called graphene could double up as a hair dye, offering a safer alternative to the current chemical options on the market. What's more, the material contains anti-static and anti-bacterial properties, meaning Graphene users might not have to wash their hair so often. According to the report, which has been published in the journal Chem, Graphene can be used to darken light coloured hair via an application process that involves spraying, brushing and then drying the hair. According to the researchers, who tested graphene oxide (GO) and its reduced form r-GO, the material can be used to create water-based formulations to form smooth and continuous coatings on hair. The 'dye' typically lasted around 30 washes in tests, with the report concluding that it could even be suitable for creating 'ombre' styles. ""Graphene not only avoids the use of toxic, small molecular ingredients in common hair dyes but also renders new properties of hair for enhanced comfort, such as greatly improved antistatic performance and heat dissipation,"" explain the researchers. Despite the great interest of this discovery, graphene hair-dyes are still far from entering the next-door hair salon. But natural and mild haircare solutions are becoming increasingly mainstream — as illustrated last December, when cosmetics giant L'Oreal announced the launch of its first-ever vegan and plant-based hair color line, ""Botanea."" Actually, this new process is already making headlines in the mainstream press, a sign of consumers' greed for innovative solutions in this sector!"
"Non-animal testing methods: 3D skin models can be used to test genotoxicity, study finds","Researchers from Henkel, BASF, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) and Procter & Gamble [1] have adapted the comet assay [2] methodology (a test allowing to detect genotoxic hazard) to two reconstructed full thickness human skin models: the EpiDerm™- and Phenion® Full-Thickness Skin Models. The resulting ""3D Skin Comet assay"" has successfully completed the first phase of a comprehensive evaluation process. Results of this initial study show that full-thickness skin models can be used to evaluate possible DNA damage (or 'genotoxicity') induced by new raw materials with a high degree of predictability and reproducibility. Eight chemicals were first tested in several laboratories each using Henkel's Phenion® Full-Thickness Skin Model, informing several validation modules. Ultimately, the 3D Skin Comet assay demonstrated a high predictive capacity and good intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility with four laboratories reaching a 100% predictivity and the fifth yielding 70%. The aim of the research was to gather enough data showing that the 3D Skin Comet assay can be used as a new in vitro tool for following up on positive findings from the standard in vitro genotoxicity test battery for dermally applied chemicals, ultimately helping to drive the regulatory acceptance of the assay. To expand the database, the validation will continue by testing an additional 22 chemicals. According to Henkel, which developed the Phenion® Full-Thickness Skin Model, bioartificial skin models are ideally suited to serve as reliable test system for a broad spectrum of applications as they are based on human skin cells and are organised in a three-dimensional environment, which well reflects human native skin. The Phenion® Full-Thickness Skin Model consists of both a fully differentiated epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin, and the underlying dermis that contains a natural, collagen-based connective tissue. The model therefore resembles human native skin in a variety of anatomical and physiological properties. ""Inventing innovative products requires reliable test methods. Therefore we, at Henkel, are engaged in developing new testing methods that allow us to assess the safety of ingredients,"" said Dr. Dirk Petersohn, Director of Biological & Clinical Research at Henkel Beauty Care. ""The excellent study results are an important step towards the acceptance of the 3D Skin Comet assay as an officially approved test method,"" he concluded."
Skin and barrier function: What are the advances in science?,"Like highlighted Dr. Michel Simon (Inserm, Toulouse) ""the epidermis is a vital multifunctional barrier between the body and the external environment. The stratum corneum, which is its ultimate layer, provides the skin with essential features."" Mechanical resistance, photo protection, antimicrobial defences, antioxidant defences, the waterproof effect all ensure a balance which, when altered, leads to important skin conditions. The molecular mechanisms associated with the barrier function are not all understood, but ongoing research on this subject constantly enriches scientific knowledge. Dr. Michel Simon insisted on the importance of the MAF/MAFB transcription factors in controlling the huge number of genes and proteins involved in the epidermal differentiation process. Corinne Leprince (Inserm, Toulouse), who has focused her research work on lamellar bodies and in particular some specific proteins, the Rab GTPases, demonstrated that the silence of one of them - the RAB11A - causes structural defects and an imperfect barrier function. The importance of the lipid organization in the stratum corneum was recalled by Professor Joke Bouwstra (Leiden University). Other subjects dealt with the energy, immunological or sensory aspects associated with the barrier function. Prof. Loïc Briand (INRA, Lyon) chose to broadened the debate by presenting the most recent findings on taste receptors located in keratinocytes. Dr. Nathalie Broussard complemented the picture by sharing the work of Prof. Denda Shiseido who refers to the epidermis as a ""third brain"". On the sidelines of the congress, the SFC awarded, as in previous years, the Young Researcher's Award to two doctoral students. Fatima Alsamad (University of Reims) was rewarded for the development of a method of detection and quantification of cutaneous AGEs by means of vibrational imaging. Nils Petitdidier (CEA-LETI, Grenoble) shared the award for his work on an imaging system for the analysis of layered tissue by diffuse reflectance. The congress was also an opportunity to recall the existence of the scientific database Kosmet with a free access for SFC members and which was upgraded thanks to the contribution of the Greentech and Péchoin Companies. Next year, the Jean Paul Marty Days will address the theme ""Peaux et annexes kératiniques du monde"" (skins and keratin appendices in the World)."
IFSCC 2017: Pollution and Asia at the core of cosmetics research,"Once again, the fight against the deleterious effects of pollution on the skin resulted in a great number of communications and posters. Whether considered from the angle of study models, the ingredients available, or the impacted biological targets, this issue is getting broader and broader and gradually integrates new elements. BASF has developed a machine that can expose the hair to both exhaust gases and UV radiation at the same time. ""The impact of pollution on the hair has not been much studied so far, whereas when our hair comes in contact with pollution, its composition and aspect changes. Our machine reproduces what is observed in reality with an exposure modulation system,"" explains Zhi Rao, of BASF China. Shiseido uses the effects of repulsion related to electrostatic forces with a polymer based on phosphorylcholine which prevents fine particles and pollen from sticking to the skin. In partnership with Cytoo, Gattefossé designed special equipment to study the biological effects of the light emitted by screens on the skin. The two companies have provided evidence of the significant impact of screen exposure on the function and mitochondrial dynamics of skin fibroblasts. As for Silab, they shared their work on mitochondria and cell stress. The congress was held in Asia, so specific studies on that market were shared. The correlation between the skin parameters of 411 Korean women and their genomic analyses helped identify new aging markers. Another study conducted on 5,205 Asian subjects provided obvious evidence that as we get old, wrinkles increase, elasticity reduces, and above all, the size of skin pores is an important marker of aging. Lastly, Amore Pacific – the company was the first to place cushion products on the market and is still the leader on this segment – studied the new expectations for this type of products in three Asian countries (Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand). The other themes tackled also provide an overview of the main topical issues for the cosmetics industry: the skin barrier, the microbiota, the art of formulating more efficient, but also greener products, makeup formulation. Next year, on September 18-21, 2018, it is Germany that will host, not the IFSCC conferences, but the 30th annual IFSCC Congress."
Skin microbiota: What are the effects of cosmetic products?,"It is possible to answer gradually to the other questions, by comparing skin swabs from subjects receiving a cosmetic product or a placebo. The major species of skin bacteria are known and there is a need for a method which is able to quantify it in a specific way. The quantitative PCR method allows to know the evolution of bacteria quantities between two conditions. For example you can follow Staphylococcus sp. (Firmicutes), Corynebacterium sp. (Actinobacteria), Propionibacterium sp. (Actinobacteria) at the genus level or target the species level. It answers to the question, saying yes, my product impacts or does not impact these species of skin microbiome. This method benefit is the cost, it is a basic investigation method, but it is limited to the targeted species. However, at this stage, it is difficult to explain if the modifications of species are good or bad. Going further, a larger investigation may be done by using the 16S rDNA sequencing for bacteria and ITS sequencing for fungi. This method will provide the semi-quantitative evolutions of the taxonomic composition and evolutions of the microbial diversity index. It is then possible to know if the product broadly modifies or not the microbiome. This method has the advantage to provide an in-depth investigation of the microbial communities and to avoid the culture which is limited to species which grow on the proposed medium. The disadvantage is the semi-quantitation, the yield variations of 16S PCR, and the lack of cause-and-effect relationship on skin. Going deeper, it is possible to know more, particularly by investigating the skin and its microbiota simultaneously, and this at the level of metabolic functions and pathways. This is done with high resolution proteomics (nanoLC-MS/ms mass spectrometry and associated bioinformatics). Indeed, the studies made at the genes level don't signal the proteins expressed by any cosmetic product effect and however, the proteins are still in charge of the skin cells working. It is thus possible to know for example the variations of defense, virulence or lipid transport mechanisms on the bacterial side and pro-inflammatory mechanisms activation on the skin side. Then you get the knowledge on the impacts. Without giving the cause-and-effects relationships, this method has the advantage to give correlations between phenomenons at the skin and bacteria levels. The main difficulty is the huge quantities of data to be processed, but we know how to reduce it with database adapted strategies, particularly with 16S genomics and proteomes coupling. We enter now in the « multi-omics » approaches which will be more and more used to deep into the mechanisms understanding. Of course, the microbiome investigation requires some precautions in the sampling plan. To avoid he high inter-individual variability and the high subject number, it is convenient to work by comparing the left side to the right side of the face or the body. Also, you have to avoid the comparison of D0 to D+3 weeks as a lot of environmental or physiological events can introduce a bias in the experiment. The following tests are available at MS Phylogene : – Targeted quantitative PCRs of bacteria directed at the genus or species level, – Bacterial 16s rDNA and fungal ITS sequencing with OTU-based estimation to investigate microbial communities diversity and determine taxonomic composition, and – High-resolution nano LC-MS/MS quantitative proteomics and CORAVALID™ / MicroXplore™ data processing: The efficient tools for discovery."
Gattefossé and Cytoo unveil first results of their research on blue light,"In order to better determine the direct effects of the skin exposure to the artificial light emitted from the screens that are everywhere in our modern life, Gattefossé and Cytoo have initiated a two-year investigation. The two companies have united technology, expertise and know-how with a first aim: to explore mitochondrial modulation and protection upon artificial visible light exposure. Unique equipment was designed by Gattefossé to accurately recreate the characteristic light emitted by screens of electronic devices (smartphones, tablets, PC). By using micropatterning technology, a method to guide cell shape and monitor cell fate, Cytoo has developed a High Content Screening assay combining precise control of human dermal fibroblast spreading and sensitive analysis of mitochondrial fusion/ fission dynamics by non-invasive live-cell imaging. A first series of results has already evidenced that exposure to screens significantly weakens mitochondrial function and dynamics. Cytoo and Gattefossé have observed a fragmentation of the mitochondrial network alongside loss of quality control and diminished capacity to produce ATP [1]. ""Using the Cytoo model, we have been able to demonstrate that screen-emitted light has a tremendous detrimental effect on the mitochondrial network of skin fibroblasts. This research highlights the need for a strategy to protect the skin from everyday artificial light"", explained Nicolas Bechetoille, Skin Biology Research Manager at Gattefossé. Mitochondria, also termed the powerhouse of cells, produce the energy essential to proper biological function of cells. Mitochondrial quality is finely adjusted by constant reshaping of its structure via a process involving fusion and fission. For this research, Cytoo has adapted its platform to dermo-cosmetic applications, in particular its models of human skin (EpiScreen™ and FibroScreen™), which allow the screening of biologically active compounds. ""Mitochondrial fission and fusion play critical roles when cells experience metabolic or environmental stresses. Both companies have brought cutting-edge technologies to address a brand-new vision of biological processes implied in skin homeostasis. This collaboration with Gattefossé validates once more the ability of Cytoo to generate innovative and predictive solutions to our partners,"" commented Luc Selig, CEO of Cytoo. This work will be presented at the 2017 IFSCC Conference in Seoul on October 23-25."
Tattoo ink can seep deep into the body: study,"The tiny particles — measuring a few millionths to a few billionths of a centimetre — include molecules from preservatives and contaminants such as nickel, chromium, manganese and cobalt, researchers reported in the peer-reviewed journal Scientific Reports. Tattoo colouring is composed of various organic and inorganic pigments, and can be contaminated with toxic impurities. Besides carbon black, the second most common ingredient used in tatoo inks is titanium dioxide, a white pigment also used in food additives, sun screens and paints. The chemical has been associated with delayed healing, itching and skin irritation. ""When someone wants to get a tattoo, they are often vary careful in choosing a parlour where they use sterile needles,"" said co-author Hiram Castillo, a researcher at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France. ""No one checks the chemical composition of the colours, but our study shows that maybe they should."" Scientists in Grenoble, joined by colleagues at the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Berlin, used X-ray fluorescence measurements to identify particles in the skin and the lymph nodes, which are located in the neck, under the arms and along the crease between the thighs and the abdomen. Only the tiniest, nano-scale particles made it into the lymph nodes. The researchers also used a technique called Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to assess changes in tissue near tattoo particles at the molecular level. They reported ""strong evidence"" for both the migration and long-term deposit of toxic elements in the body. Now that their presence has been established, the next step is to look for evidence of adverse effects, including inflammation, they said. Once a rarity outside of marginal communities, tattoos have become mainstream fashion accessories in recent years. By one estimate, some 40 percent of Millennials in the United States have at least one tat, hidden or on display."
Self-tanning: New substance can induce UV-free melanin production in human skin,"Epidemiological studies clearly show that individuals with fair skin and/or poor tanning ability are at higher risk for developing nonmelanoma and melanoma skin cancers, which are uncommon in darkly pigmented individuals. The authors of the study published in the US journal Cell Reports [1] therefore consider that the possibility to induce pigment production by human cells through the topical application of the newly designed substance is a realistic pathway toward the reduction of skin cancer risk. The researchers from the Harvard Medical School developed small-molecule SIK inhibitors that were optimized for human skin penetration, resulting in MITF upregulation and induction of melanogenesis. Applied as a cream to the skin, the drug allowed red-haired mice to develop a deep tan. Like their pale-skinned human counterparts, the mice are particularly susceptible to the damaging effects of the sun's ultra-violet rays. The original breakthrough in mice was announced more than a decade ago, in a study published in the British journal Nature in 2006. But it has taken scientists that much time to work out how to make much thicker human skin absorb the substance. The initial report revealed that a substance called forskolin gave red-haired mice a deep tan without exposure to UV light. But because human skin is relatively hairless compared to animals', it has evolved to be much tougher in order to protect against heat, cold and other environmental factors, and the topical substance could not penetrate it effectively. ""Human skin is a very good barrier and is a formidable penetration challenge. Therefore, other topical approaches just did not work,"" said David Fisher, chief of dermatology at Massachusetts General Hospital, a professor of dermatology at Harvard Medical School, and one of the authors of the study. ""But 10 years later, we have come up with a solution. It's a different class of compounds, that work by targeting a different enzyme that converges on the same pathway that leads to pigmentation,"" he said. The scientists tested the substance on samples of human skin kept in laboratories and found that it darkened in proportion to the dosage applied. The tan lasted several days. In animal tests, red-haired mice became ""almost jet black in a day or two with a strong enough dose,"" the researchers observed. When the dosage was removed, normal skin regeneration meant the colour faded within a week or so. ""We believe the potential importance of this work is towards a novel strategy for skin cancer prevention,"" Fisher said. ""Skin is the most common organ in our bodies to be afflicted with cancer, and the majority of cases are thought to be associated with UV radiation,"" he said. The long-term aim would be to create a cream that develops a tan without exposure to sunlight but which also absorbs harmful UV rays like traditional sun screens."
"""The exposome concept could lead to many promising cosmetic innovations,"" Aïna Queiroz, ID bio","Premium Beauty News - You made quit an impression at the last edition of In-Cosmetics by proposing brands to target the exposome. Can you tell us what it all about? Aïna Queiroz - We are indeed delighted with the welcome received by our latest launch and for which we chose to focus on the exposome concept. This term, encompasses all the exposures to which we are subjected as individuals from the intrauterine stage - i.e. already in the womb of our mother - to the end of our lives. This term was coined for the first time in 2005 by Dr. Christopher Wild (current Director of the International Agency for Research on Cancer) and was later found in the French Loi Touraine of 2015, as part of the study and management of environmental exposure in France. If we reconsider the issue in dermo-cosmetics, studies on exposomes are still in their infancy. However, the first scientific journals and publications started to appear, allowing, for example, getting a better understanding of the relationship between exposome and skin ageing. This could lead to very promising new opportunities for our industry in terms of innovation, both on the side of finished product and of active ingredients. Premium Beauty News - Is this an extension of the product offering developed for fighting urban pollution? Aïna Queiroz - More than an extension, we want to take a step back because the exposome encompasses a much wider perimeter than urban pollution alone. For example, such factors as stress, microflora, climate, food, tobacco or alcohol consumption, education, UVs, blue light and many other parameters, will be considered as being part of the exposome. As part of the development of actives planned by ID bio to deal with the exposome, we will of course integrate the anti-pollution dimension, for which we have been already proposing various solutions in the past three years. But finally our offer intends to address more broadly this issue of multiple exposures. Premium Beauty News - What are the solutions proposed by ID bio? Aïna Queiroz - The main thread guiding our Research and Innovation department was to identify the vegetable shields capable of preventing and fighting in a complementary manner the various consequences of these exposures. And to reinforce the natural protection of the skin against the diversity of exposome constituents (UVs, tobacco smoke, pollution, stress, temperature variations etc.), we have already imagined and developed three solutions in synergy: 1. A mechanical shield to physically limit the penetration of harmful particles right to the epidermis. This active ingredient is obtained from marshmallow root, with some complex sugars that form at the surface a protective veil in the way of a ""glyco-cocoon"" 2. A biological shield, which prevents and repairs the effects of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, a characteristic feature of tobacco smoke and certain exhaust gases. The development of this ingredient was bio-inspired by buckwheat, a plant studied in phyto-remediation (de-pollution of an environment thanks to a plant species) for its ability to capture some heavy metals from the soil and survive. 3. A soothing shield that relieves particularly fragile and regularly exposed skins to stress or temperature changes, for example. This ingredient was designed with an aim to promote a sustainable Limousin co-product: the saffron flower but with its pistil removed. Premium Beauty News - How does it work? Aïna Queiroz - Today, different mechanisms are already identified but obviously there is still a lot to discover on this new research thematic. To ensure the complementarity of each of our plant based offers, we explored different avenues. Concerning the mechanical shield, we developed an active with both, anti-adhesive properties vs. the exposure to particles (upstream) and a booster effect for their removal (downstream) in order to imagine a complete effective cosmetic routine, from morning to night. As for the development of a biological shield, we sought to limit the pro-inflammatory response (IL-8) and preserve skin homeostasis (tight junction, CLDN1 & 4) against UV and benzo[a] pyrene exposures. In addition, the aim of our soothing shield was to minimize the impact of stress or the skin chafing sensation. For an identical active we therefore highlighted effects on the barrier function (profilaggrine), inflammation (NF-kB/TNF-α) or neurosensory discomfort (TRPV1). Finally, when we project ourselves at the beginning of each of our innovations, in addition to the final claim targeted (moisturising, slimming, anti-ageing, among others), our reflex is now to ask ourselves if our active couldn't also protect us from one of the effects of exposome?"

What is the potential for personalized genomics and epigenetics in cosmetic science?,"In a speech opening this congress, which brought together a large audience at the École Normale Supérieure in Lyon, Professor Pierre-Henri Gouyon reminded ""genes have no effect outside a given environment. Genetic information is immaterial and the effect of genes can only be seen in the environment in which they are observed"". That is what epigenetic is all about. Among gene regulators, microRNAs, which were discovered in nematodes in 1993, are now the subject of numerous studies. ""To date, more than 2,600 microRNA sequences have been described in humans,"" said Professor Jérôme Lamartine. As far as the skin is concerned, the researcher highlighted the role of Mir-203 as a transition regulator between proliferation and differentiation in the human epidermis. Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) are also of key regulators of gene expression. Recent researches by Dr. Markus Kretz of the University of Regensburg in Germany has that LncRNAs can impact the regulation of the skin homeostasis. More concretely, according to a study conducted by Clarins, daily meteorological changes can affect the regulation of genes. ""We conducted a large study about the impact of brief and repeated weather variations on differentiation and matrix remodelling of a reconstructed human skin model. The results show a significant reduction in the expression of coding genes for various collagens, laminins, proteoglycans, thus suggesting a profound remodelling of the extracellular matrix,"" explained Christelle Guéré of Clarins. Will the future of personal care be the design of personalized cosmetics based on genomic analyses? According to Philippe Benech, from Genex, ""if the identification of genes involved in pathologies or in ageing benefits from recent advances in genomics and bioinformatics, the understanding of involved functional mechanisms remains a major challenge since the function of a given gene can change with the context."" Genex has developed PredictSearch, an in-house software using big data, which could be described as a mix between Google and Medline to carry out biofunctional analyzes of the genes. In France, genetic examination can only be carried out for medical, judicial or scientific research purposes. This is not the case in the US, but also in Norway and Sweden, where some cosmetics companies offer tailor-made products based on a DNA analysis of the customer. Is it a real scientific advance or only marketing argument, it is probably too early to know…"
"""Changes in the rheological properties of the skin open very promising prospects,"" Bérengère Fromy, CNRS","Premium Beauty News - Your career path is unusual. You are a mathematician by training and currently a CNRS Research Director in the Laboratory of Tissue Biology and Therapeutic Engineering (LBTI) of Lyon and a skin specialist. How does one switch from mathematics to biology? Bérengère Fromy - It was during my PhD at the University of Glamorgan in Wales that a door towards biology opened. I was actually working on the mathematical modelling of the vascular effects induced by support stockings to optimize the choice of sizes. The model emphasised was common practice among Egyptians: bandage improves venous return. We were focused on macro-circulation but the model also demonstrated that light pressures could improve microcirculation, an unknown process in biology. Later on, I continued with a post-doctoral research work in Angers in the laboratory of Professor Jean-Louis Saumet to verify the existence of this microvascular process and investigate further the physiological mechanisms involved in the relationship between cutaneous microcirculation and mechanical stress. To this end, I developed a small pendulum, which coupled to a Doppler laser, enabled to measure blood flow in the skin when it is subjected to light pressures. Light pressure promotes blood microcirculation in healthy skin by inducing vasodilatation. The theme I have been focusing on at the CNRS since 2002 is based on this work and this ""mechanical sensitivity and cutaneous vasodilation"" interaction. We are seeking to understand the skin's defence mechanisms to fight effectively against mechanical stress. Premium Beauty News - In 2012, you were awarded the CNRS bronze medal, for your work published in the prestigious journal Nature Medicine; what was the scope of this work? Bérengère Fromy - We identified a pressure-induced vasodilation (PIV) signalling pathway in healthy skins that have the particularity to spontaneously adjust to mechanical stresses. In pathological skin, this vasodilation is impaired or absent. We demonstrated the role of the ASIC3 mechano-sensitive channel in this physiological process. ASIC3 is activated under the application of local pressure and triggers sensory nerve endings that generate the release of neuropeptides vasodilators (CGRP, VIP, PACAP). These neuropeptides bind to endothelial cells that in turn release nerve relaxing prostaglandins and nitric oxide. This naturally occurring process in healthy skin is less efficient in pathological skin with impaired endothelial cells, such as during ageing or diabetes. This condition contributes to the weakening of the skin under pressure, which can lead to bedsores. In the case of peripheral sensory neuropathy, the person has no nervous information to help detect the applied pressure, which results in worsening its defence capabilities against bedsores. Premium Beauty News - Today, what is your outlook for the future? Bérengère Fromy - This work offers several fields of application with, first, the medical field and the fight against bedsores. We are working on antioxidant treatments that could improve and restore the PIV process. The cosmetic sector is also taking interest in our work and in our ability to assess the functional quality of skin. Furthermore, we are continuing our work by studying the influence of skin viscoelastic properties on microvascular adjustment capabilities in the presence of mechanical stress. Changes in these rheological properties during ageing and in health conditions such as diabetes opens very promising avenues."
"""Information is more important than matter"", Pierre-Henri Gouyon","Premium Beauty News - What is your view on personalized genomics and epigenetics? Pierre-Henri Gouyon - Genetic information is coded in the form of a message through the DNA, a very stable molecule. It should be known that taken separately, this information has no value: a gene cannot make anything. This information must be read by a system we can call a decipherer, which can be found in a given environment. This Message-Decipherer-Environment (MDE) system is interdependent. I like to compare it with the cooking field, where the recipe is the message: it will never make a dish on its own. The cook is the decipherer, and the laboratory where he works and the ingredients he uses are the environment. Epigenetics have to do with the decipherer, which sets up reading systems depending on many elements, including the environment, and modifies the way the message is read. That is when hormones, cell differentiation systems, and the mechanisms related to DNA methylation get involved. And we get different answers from the same hereditary message. Epigenetics science is not new, it appeared in the 1930s. But it was recently demonstrated that certain epigenetic disruptions could be transmitted on the intergenerational level. About ten years ago, researchers at the University of Umea, Sweden, showed that two generations later, in a village in the North of Europe, certain individuals suffered from the same diseases as their ancestors, although they had not experienced the same famine/abundance episodes favourable to diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. More recently, it was found that a disrupted reproductive system in women could result in anomalies in the sexual development of their girl descendants. So, obviously, we cannot analyze this system partially. It should be considered as a whole when taking interest in this topic. Premium Beauty News - Your laboratory has been working on genetic systems, adaptation, and domestication. Do the issues related to climate change act on these systems? Pierre-Henri Gouyon - In my early career, I conducted research work on the genetic variability of aromatic thyme essences. Six genetically different essences coexisted, including one which could be found in a region north of Montpellier, France, where climate conditions were extreme in winter. In the 1960s, the temperature in this area could reach -30 °C. In the 1980s, it was only -20 °C, and now, the thermometer rarely goes down below -10 °C. Forty years later, it was found that these changes resulted in the gradual disappearance of forms that resisted against the cold. Their adaptation involves the elimination of non-adapted forms. Premium Beauty News - You have co-written Le fil de la vie : la face immatérielle du vivant, a book published in April 2016 by Odile Jacob, in which you explain information is more important than matter. Pierre-Henri Gouyon - Indeed, with Jean-Louis Dessalles, who is an expert in artificial language and intelligence, and Cédric Gaucherel, specialist of ecosystems and their interactions with animal and human life, we suggest a complementary view on living organisms. Western science is based on the study of matter and energy. We consider life as a set of structures produced by information and able to reproduce information, whether genetic, social, or ecosystemic. It is genetic information that reproduces, not living beings. Genes use living organisms as vehicles to reproduce. Information unites organisms in time, and it is able to travel from one organism to another, be stored in them, be transmitted, and withstand the test of time beyond their temporal limit."
Study shines light on another benefit of sunlight,"Researchers at the USA's Georgetown University Medical Center have found that sunlight plays a positive role in the action of T lymphocytes, or T cells, which allow the human body to combat pathogens. The study found that blue light present in sunlight directly activates the cells, both in samples taken from mice and humans, by increasing their speed of movement. This, in turn, makes them more effective at fighting infection. The T-cell response was found to be driven by hydrogen peroxide, a compound that white blood cells release when an infection is detected in the body. It serves to kill bacteria and to rally T cells to mobilize an immune response. Given the large surface area of human skin, all of the T cells present in skin could potentially benefit from this phenomenon through exposure to blue light, the researchers suggest. Note that vitamin D is only produced in the body via exposure to UV rays, which can be harmful in cases of prolonged sun exposure. If blue light from the sun's rays is capable of energizing infection-fighting T cells, it could be a potential means of treatment for boosting immunity in many patients, the researchers conclude. Blue light present in sunlight could give the immune system a boost. © shapecharge/Istock.com"
Jean-Paul Marty Days 2016: The impact of pollution on the skin,"It is believed that pollution is the 4th cause of death in China, and populations consider it the 2nd reason for early aging. It affects 92% of the world population. The nature of pollutants varies according to the geographic situation, but everyone feels concerned. Cosmetics manufacturers have well understood the issues associated and, since 2011, the number of products launched with an antipollution claim has increased twofold. If the impact of pollution on public health is increasingly more studied, its impact on the skin remains to be more accurately defined. ""There are still few in vivo studies on this issue, in particular on the synergy between pollutants and exposure to UV rays. And yet, long UVAs play quite a significant role on the photoxicity of pollutants,"" explains Jérémie Sœur, of L'Oréal R&I. It is hard to measure the actual skin exposure to pollutants, while many in vitro and ex vivo tests were performed and showed an effect of pollution on the cell functions. The transcutaneous penetration of very small fine particles, 6 to 20 times smaller than the size of a hair, has not been demonstrated yet. According to Jérémie Sœur, ""The pollutants carried by fine particles might adsorb or desorb on the skin."" He adds that ""in addition to the topical administration, there is another important route to be taken into account: the systemic route."" Cosmetic actives suppliers and finished product brands have presented various approaches to tackle pollution. Some are inspired from bioremediation, like IDbio, others ensure the protection of certain cell functions like mitochondria and proteasome. Physical screens to pollution are also recommended, showing there can be multiple angles of approach to deal with this complex issue. The congress was also an opportunity for the SFC to award the ""SFC Prize"" attributed to Jean-Claude Le Joliff for his many contributions to cosmetics, including the recent Cosmétothèque, the library of cosmetics knowledge. The SFC also supports young researchers: PhD Florine Eudier, of the University of Le Havre, France, was rewarded for her original approach to the evaluation of the effects of pollution on the properties of the surface of the skin. The SFC offers her the possibility to travel to Korea and attend the next IFSCC congress there."
UV filters possibly linked to the increased frequency of frontal fibrosing alopecia,"Findings of a recent study published in the British Journal of Dermatology (BJD) [1] suggest an association between sunscreens contained in facial skin care products and the increased frequency of frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) among women. Described for the first time in 1994 in Australia, FFA is an inflammatory scarring alopecia that mainly involves the frontal and frontal / temporal hairline and eyebrows. FFA mainly affects postmenopausal women although it also occurs in younger women and occasionally in men. FFA remained rare during the 1990s but has become increasingly common in the last 10-15 years In order to identify possible causes of this new disease, a questionnaire enquiring about exposure to a wide range of lifestyle, social and medical factors was completed by 105 women with FFA and 100 age and sex-matched control subjects. A sub-cohort of 40 women with FFA was patch tested to an extended British standard series of allergens. ""This study would not have been possible 15 years ago. The fact that we and others are now able to recruit large numbers of patients with FFA with relative ease is illustrative of the rising incidence of this disease, making it difficult to escape the conclusion that an external cause is responsible,"" explain the authors. Results of the questionnaire show that the use of sunscreens was significantly greater in the FFA group compared with controls. Subjects with FFA also showed a trend towards more frequent use of facial moisturizers and foundations but, compared with controls, the difference in frequencies just failed to reach statistical significance. The high frequency of positive patch tests among the FFA group could implicate fragrances. However, ""fragrances have been present in facial cosmetics for many years and this would not explain the apparent recent surge in incidence of FFA,"" highlight the authors. Actually, the clue may reside in the frequency of sunscreen use. Twice as many women in the FFA group regularly used a sunscreen compared with controls. ""Although the use of dedicated sunscreens by subjects with FFA did not approach universality it is noteworthy that many facial moisturizers now contain sunscreen chemicals, a trend that has accelerated in recent years."" The authors also point that allergy to sunscreen chemicals is well recognized although uncommon and that the first cases of FFA were reported from Australia where a campaign promoting the use of sunscreens to prevent skin cancer was launched in 1981. However, the authors admit they cannot exclude the possibility that the higher use of sunscreens and skin care in the FFA group reflects a tendency by these women to 'look after' their skin (due to the aesthetic consequences of the disease). They also highlight the fact that the low level of discrimination between subjects with FFA and control groups with regard to the use of facial products is a significant limitation. Moreover, the study does not make it possible to determine which solar filters are possibly involved."
Scientists reveal the secret of frankincense,"It is mentioned more than twenty times in the Bible, where it is one of the gifts offered by the Three Wise Men. Frankincense (also called olibanum [2]), one of the world's oldest fragrances, is a gum resin that exudes from the bark of Boswellia trees, which grow in countries bordering the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. It has been used for more than 6,000 years by every civilization, from Mesopotamia to the present. Regularly burned during religious ceremonies, it contributes to the very particular smell of churches. Despite its long history and the large amount of research dedicated to it, the exact nature of the molecules that give frankincense its distinctive fragrance surprisingly remained unknown. Nicolas Baldovini and his team at the Institut de chimie de Nice (CNRS/UNS), which specializes in fragrances, have just succeeded in identifying them for the first time. The chief difficulty lay in finding methods of analysis precise enough to characterize these odorous substances, which are present in the fragrance in very small quantities (a few hundred ppm), and therefore all the more difficult to detect. To do so, the researchers used three kilos of essential oil of frankincense from Somalia, from which they isolated a purified sample of approximately 1 mg of two odorant constituents, through a series of distillations, extractions, and chromatography analyses. A group of researchers trained to recognize the typical odour of frankincense proved necessary to assist in this work, for only the human nose is sensitive enough to detect these constituents in small quantities in a mixture. The team then had to determine the molecular structure of these substances using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR, the equivalent of an MRI applied to molecules). The two molecules, which give frankincense its ""old church"" smell have been identified as (+)-trans- and (+)-cis-2- octylcyclopropyl-1-carboxylic acids. Moreover, this is the first time that these compounds have been discovered in nature. In order to irrefutably confirm their characterization established using spectral analysis, the team then synthesized each of these components - which they named ""olibanic acids"" - and used synthesis to demonstrate they were identical to the natural components. ""Thanks to this discovery, perfume makers can now produce these molecules artificially in unlimited amounts, and use them in different perfumes,"" concludes the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS)in a release."
"In vitro method in sun care, a status","There is no doubt, we have to replace in vivo methods by in vitro methods for sunscreen products. Whether for economic or ethical reasons, thanks to manufacturers, under pressure from the associations, from the European commission, health or security agencies, the consensus is clear, the next developed method must be an in vitro one. By the way, the work began many years ago thanks to Colipa who published the UVA in vitro method in 2006 offering an alternative to the in vivo method (PPD). But what about today in Europe if an industry wants to develop and sell sunscreen products because Europe has two methods for UVA, one in vivo and one in vitro. Is it possible to replace one method by the other one? The only standardized method for the SPF is in vivo, can we still use an in vitro method for claiming an SPF? Finally what are the other standardized methods and ongoing standardization? Although some answers seem simple, but conflicting information from the web, several newspapers or magazines can be misleading. During Cosmeticdays, next December 1st and 2nd in Marseille, we'll discuss the standardized methods to date as well as those under development, including in vitro SPF and the complexity for future developments. A well-defined status could answer precisely to all open questions about the use of these different methods for determining indices of protection and their future."
3D bioprinting of skin tissues: better and better-performing techniques,"What is the objective of tissue engineering? Developing skin substitutes to maintain, repair, enhance, or replace damaged tissue on patients. Several approaches coexisted over the years, and it is now possible to obtain better and better-performing skin substitutes. ""We already have functional microvascularized models, and we are also working on models to which the lymphatic system was introduced. It is a challenge for our team, because few studies were conducted in this field, and the lymphatic system is very complex to structure in a functional way,"" explains Laure Gibot, of Toulouse's Institute of Pharmacology and Structural Biology in the south of France. As for Alain Colige, of the Laboratory of Connective Tissues Biology at the University of Liège, Belgium, he has been working on materials based on chitosan nanofibres. ""Chitosan nanofibres guarantee a large specific area and their properties are close to human skin's."" Other methods also involve electrospinning, as Frédéric Bossard, of the Joseph Fourier University of Grenoble, France, explains. Nevertheless, the field that is really revolutionizing tissue engineering is undeniably 3D printing. ""It is just the beginning, as we must solve reproducibility issues,"" explains Colin McGuckin, of CTiBiotech. Still, Christophe Marquette, Coordinator of the 3DFab platform, has worked with Amélie Thépot, CEO of LabSkin Creation, to obtain a bioprinted skin model. ""The technique makes it possible to reduce the culture time by half, from 50 to 21 days, but also to get an undulated dermo-epidermal junction [1], which cannot be done with the usual tissue engineering techniques. We are now able to print all skin layers, even if the epidermis is harder to obtain."" The bioextrusion technique uses a patented bioink and prints 1cm3 of skin in less than two minutes: an outstanding performance and first achievements that will no doubt pave the way for others."
Study suggests triclosan has no impact on human microbiome or endocrine function,"Found in soaps, shower gels, toothpaste, deodorants, mouthwash, moisturizing creams, anti-acne products, shaving creams and more, triclosan is a synthetic antibacterial agent used in all kinds of personal hygiene products since the 1980s. The use of triclosan is so widespread that traces of the substance are found in most people's urine. In fact, a study carried out between 2003 and 2004 in the USA found triclosan present in urine samples from 75% of individuals tested. The impact of the substance on human health has been a subject of controversy for many years. Suspected to be an endocrine disruptor, triclosan has also been suspected to contribute to antimicrobial resistance or have an adverse effect on the human microbiome and also to increase allergies. In 2014, the European Commission banned the use of triclosan in all shaving products, such as foams, as of October 30 that year. This kind of product was considered a particular risk, since small cuts to the skin's surface could allow triclosan to enter the body more easily. In 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration asked manufacturers of soaps and washes containing triclosan to provide evidence proving the effectiveness and safety of their products, widely used in the USA and elsewhere. American researchers [1] have now found that a group of people exposed to triclosan through day-to-day personal hygiene products suffered no damage to their intestinal microbiota or endocrine system. The findings contradict the conclusions of previous studies on mice, dating from 2012, that pointed to harmful effects on the reproductive and endocrine systems, as well as the muscular and immune systems, with respiratory and food allergies. The substance's role in increasing antibiotic resistance was also highlighted. ""There are a lot of people who are fearful of triclosan, but we didn't find anything to support that concern in our study,"" said principal study investigator Julie Parsonnet, MD, George Deforest Barnett Professor in Medicine and Professor of Health Research and Policy, Stanford School of Medicine. ""When you throw most antibiotics into humans, they are an atom bomb on the microbiota, but we found that when people are exposed to triclosan through normal household products, it does not cause a major blow to our microbial ecosystems."" The new study saw 13 healthy participants randomly asked to use personal hygiene products that either contained triclosan or did not contain triclosan for four months. After this initial phase, participants switched over to the alternative group for four additional months. Blood, stool, urine and oral samples were taken and their microbiome composition analyzed. Although triclosan was massively present in participants' urine during the period where they were using products containing the substance, there was very little change in their intestinal and oral flora, and there was no significant impact on endocrine or metabolic markers. Though this study was limited by the small sample size and imprecise administration of household and personal care products, the authors say that triclosan at physiologic levels from exposure to these products does not appear to have a significant or important impact on human oral or gut microbiome structure or on a panel of metabolic markers.

"A 'second skin' polymer to eliminate wrinkles, eye bags","While the silicone based product is a long way from being on store shelves, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) said it could one day offer more than just cosmetic lifts, but also protect sensitive skin from the ravages of eczema and dermatitis. ""It's an invisible layer that can provide a barrier, provide cosmetic improvement, and potentially deliver a drug locally to the area that's being treated,"" said researcher Daniel Anderson, an associate professor in MIT's Department of Chemical Engineering. ""Those three things together could really make it ideal for use in humans."" Scientists have been working on a polymer like this - one that could mimic the properties of natural skin - for about five years, according to the report in last week's edition of the journal Nature Materials [1]. The silicone-based polymer can be applied in a thin layer on the skin during a two-step process. ""First, polysiloxane components are applied to the skin, followed by a platinum catalyst that induces the polymer to form a strong cross-linked film that remains on the skin for up to 24 hours,"" said the study. ""Both layers are applied as creams or ointments, and once spread onto the skin, XPL becomes essentially invisible."" Tests on human subjects showed it could reshape saggy skin under the eyes for about 24 hours, and made skin more hydrated. Future uses could include using the ""second skin"" for protection against the sun and ultraviolet rays, researchers said. Researchers say the new product, called a cross-linked polymer layer or XPL, works better than the currently available options for wound dressing - silicone gel sheets and polyurethane films. ""Creating a material that behaves like skin is very difficult,"" said study co-author Barbara Gilchrest, a dermatologist at Massachusetts General Hospital. ""Many people have tried to do this, and the materials that have been available up until this have not had the properties of being flexible, comfortable, non-irritating, and able to conform to the movement of the skin and return to its original shape."" Scientists have created a catalogue of a hundred polymers before testing multiple combinations and find the best way to recreate the look, strength and elasticity of a healthy skin. Besides its cosmetic applications, the XPL platform may offer advanced solutions to compromised skin barrier function, pharmaceutical delivery and wound dressings. The research team included MIT, Massachusetts General Hospital and researchers from two companies, known as Living Proof and Olivo Labs. The latter aims to develop the technology and market it probably with a first focus on its therapeutic properties."
Innovations and Science: New efficacy tests for new products,"The beauty world is moving to a new era. ""Products are becoming increasingly smarter. They seek to meet in real time the needs of consumers, like the Romy concept, dedicated to the creation of made-to-measure and highly customized cosmetics. They can be self-adaptive, like the suncare products in the Expert Sun range developed by Shiseido with a sunscreen protection which is enhanced when it comes into contact with water or sweat, thanks to the Wet Sun technology. Some are the result of collective intelligence, like the Clinique Smart Custom Serum,"" explains Stéphanie Machon founder of Make It Bloom!. Others seek to meet growing consumer demand for anti-pollution products that contribute to well-being. ""All these developments encourage us to adopt new approaches to support never seen before claims,"" explains Anne Sirvent from the Laboratoire Dermscan, who recently developed a deposition protocol of pollution and dust particles on the skin. Ctibiotech has developed a bio 3D printed skin tissue for the in vitro evaluation of cell responses in contact with substances selected according to product claims. ""Smart Beauty starts with us and the in vitro assessment of raw materials on 3D tissues,"" details Nico Forraz CEO of Ctibiotech. Specialised in skin ageing, Patricia Rousselle, Research Director at the CNRS, uses the latest innovations in efficacy testing to evaluate the efficiency of new molecules on processes she identified. ""Our research on perlecan, a proteoglycan with a heparan sulfate function has showed its benefits in the renewal of the epidermal basal layer and its contribution in restoring the skin's regenerative capacity.""

CTPA responds to study on chemical exposure in teenage girls using cosmetics,"A team of researchers from UC Berkeley and Clinica de Salud del Valle de Salinas looked at the levels of certain chemical substances in the bodies of Latina teenagers who were participating in the Health and Environmental Research on Makeup of Salinas Adolescents (HERMOSA) project, set up to look at the effect of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on adolescents. The researchers enrolled 100 girls with the aim to determine whether using personal care products whose labels stated they did not contain ""potentially endocrine disrupting chemicals"" such as phthalates, parabens, triclosan, and benzophenone-3 (BP-3) for three days could lower urinary concentrations. The researchers asked the teenage girls to switch from their usual cosmetics to products labelled as containing the controversial chemical ingredients. The authors of the study said they looked at young females not only because women expose themselves to more personal care products than men, using on average 12 self-care products daily compared to the average man who uses just 6, but also because previous research has suggested that teenage girls use even more self-care products than the average adult woman. To test the any changes in chemical exposure during the trial, the participants submitted urine samples before and after the three days. The results, published last week in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, showed that after these three days, levels of chemicals in the body had dropped significantly. Levels of diethyl phthalate decreased by 27 per cent, methyl and propyl parabens by 44 and 45 per cent respectively, and triclosan and benzophenone-3 (BP-3) both dropped by 36 per cent. From their results the team concluded that women can significantly reduce their exposure to some chemicals by taking just a short break from self-care products or by choosing products with fewer chemicals. ""This study demonstrates that techniques available to consumers, such as choosing personal care products that are labelled to be free of phthalates, parabens, triclosan, and BP-3, can reduce personal exposure to possible endocrine disrupting chemicals,"" concluded the researchers. In a response to the study publication, the Cosmetics, Toiletry and Perfumery Association (CTPA) said that ""nowhere does the study itself demonstrate any endocrine disrupting property or show any negative impact from exposure to the chosen chemicals."" According to CTPA, the fact that levels of certain chemicals found in the body or in the urine decrease when stopping using products containing these substances is really to be expected and is not specific to cosmetics. ""Of course our body is used to coping with things that we eat or may get absorbed by the skin, but these are readily metabolised and harmlessly excreted. The levels that we get rid of will be dependent on what we put in. However, what is really important to remember is not whether we can detect the presence of a substance in the body or urine, but whether the presence of that substance can actually cause us harm,"" adds the association. The publication of this new study follows a series of attacks by consumer protection groups about potentially harmful ingredients in cosmetic products. According to experts of the cosmetics market, this wave of catchy headlines and the fact that safety is almost always linked to natural products should benefit to natural and organic cosmetic brands, despite the fact that scientists warn that ""nature"" and ""safety"" are not automatically correlated. Update: March 15, 2016 - 10.30 am (Paris) Yesterday, the Personal Care Products Council (PCPC) also responded to the study. According to the Washington based trade association: ""The study identified nothing new. The ingredients found in urine were at levels generally consistent with results from other monitoring studies, e.g., the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The levels reported for these ingredients have not been shown to cause negative health effects, and the mere presence of a substance does not translate to harm."" The PCPC also criticizes the choices of the study authors regarding the chemicals they chose to focus on. ""The study included three phthalates, only one of which - diethyl phthalate (DEP) - has any significant use in cosmetics and personal care products. DEP has been repeatedly assessed and found to be safe as currently used."" Read more here: www.personalcarecouncil.org"
Gene holds key to (no) grey hair: study,"The gene, IRF4, was known to affect skin and hair colour through melanin production, but a new study is the first to pinpoint its unique role in the inexorable transition to shades of grey. Further research on precisely how IRF4 works could unlock techniques and treatments that slow or even halt that process, said the scientists. ""An initial avenue has to do with the role IRF4 could play in survival and maintenance of cells that make pigment,"" said Andres Ruiz-Linares, a professor at the University College London Genetics Institute who led the study published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications. Understanding how the gene interacts with other genes controlling hair colour, for example, might yield cosmetic applications that block the fade to grey as hair grows in the follicle, he told AFP. To undertake the analysis, scientists did a so-called genome-wide association scan (GWAS) of 6,630 volunteers in Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Peru, matching similarities in their DNA with physical traits. But rather than selecting subjects that shared a common ancestry - all northern Europeans or Japanese, for example - the researchers deliberately mixed things up. Nearly half the participants were of European background, 40 per cent were Native American, and six per cent were of recent African origin. Depending on ancestry, people tend to go grey at different stages in their lives, the study found. ""The average age of hair greying for Caucasians is in the mid-30s,"" Ruiz-Linares told AFP. For East Asians, the loss of colour starts in their late 30s, and for sub-Saharan Africans, in their mid- 40s. Likewise, the greying process is said to be ""premature"" if it starts before the age of 20 in people of European background, and before 25 and 30 among Asians and Africans, respectively. Setting aside unresolved ethical issues, one could even ""wildly contemplate"" the use of gene editing, an ultra-precise cut-and-paste process for altering DNA sequences, he said. But the IRF4 variant that favours grey also produces fair hair, he cautioned, so tinking with the gene could also mean fewer blondes. The size and original design of the research yielded a trove of new results. Another gene, PRSS53, for example, was found to influence curliness, shedding light on the evolution of hair shape that led to straight hair in East Asia and among Native Americans. A variant of a third gene, PAX3, was strongly associated with ""mono-brow"", the tendency - especially among men - for eyebrows to be joined by a bridge of facial hair."
The Cosmétothèque to spread the heritage of cosmetics,"Created on the initiative of Jean-Claude Le Joliff in January 2014, the Cosmétothèque, which is intended to preserve the cosmetics industry's heritage, has already compiled thematic dossiers, stories, and over fifty subjects in the form of interviews. ""Just like what is being done with perfumery at the Osmothèque in Versailles - the 20-year-old unique perfume library recounting the history of perfumery founded by Jean Kerléo - I had the idea to tell the whole long history of cosmetics, but written by the players and professionals of this industrial branch. And it was first to be available on a web portal."" What was Le Joliff's aim? After he graduated as a biologist, he was in charge of the R&D, and then the Research & Innovation department of a leading French luxury and cosmetics group. He has now been committed to working as a consultant for companies implementing innovation strategies for 15 years. This forward-looking activity made him grow aware of the importance of being familiar with the past! And he wishes cosmetics players' memory and know-how would not keep getting lost, because it is harmful for the industry. ""The cosmetics industry is a real hub for intense research in innovation. But to be efficient, it needs to rely on the best state of the art, and it is not always an easy thing to do."" That is how the Cosmétothèque was created as an Association Loi 1901, and it now counts about fifty members. It is mainly based on voluntary, unpaid contributions, and the main cosmetics themes are presented via seven columns: brands, creators, products, ingredients, packaging, the collector corner, and the mirror effect. ""The mirror effect shows old products can be used to create insights, by reinterpreting the past, as they do in fashion. Besides, it can be noted that some products were even ahead of their time, maybe sometimes too much, like the Clarins lotion against electromagnetic waves developed in 2007, whose production had to be stopped."" Today, a new milestone has been reached for the Cosmétothèque: it is now hosted by the BIU's website. ""Being hosted by this inter-university library shows the university community increasingly recognizes what we do. The Cosmétothèque will be available alongside historical pharmaceutical and dental sites, and we will be able to create virtual exhibitions like Secret de Beauté, built up at the IFSCC congress, and to gather several articles dealing with the same theme in the form of books: the Cahiers de la Cosmétothèque,"" explains Jean-Claude Le Joliff."
Bio-printing of human skin: Poietis targets pharmaceutical and cosmetic uses,"""We combine 3D printing technology and cell biology to manufacture biological tissues, layer by layer,"" summarizes Fabien Guillemot, Founder of biotech firm Poietis, ex-researcher at French Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM). Three-dimensional printing of biological tissues, responds to a wide range of major socio-economic challenges: – Reduction of animal testing thanks to in vitro models allowing to evaluate efficacy and toxicity of cosmetic ingredients and active pharmaceutical compounds; – Drug discovery by producing predictive disease models; – Emergence of personalized medicine by making custom tissues from the patient cells; – Regenerative medicine by fabricating custom grafts. According to Poietis, market perspectives associated with bioprinting were recently valued at close to 2 billion euros in 2020. To date, four bio-printing technologies are available on the market. However, according to its founders, Poeitis (from the Greek ""manufacture"") is for now the only company in the world using a laser-assisted technology to ""print"" living matter. ""Using lasers for bio-printing works a bit like inkjet technology, in the sense that a laser drive creates a spurt of ink, the ink being a sort of cradle for cells. By moving the laser beam, we lay drops of cells at different locations and rebuild 3D structures layer by layer,"" explains Fabien Guillemot. ""With laser technology, we have a resolution of around 20 micrometres (one millionth of a metre), so we can print cells cell by cell and give even more complexity to what we create, and reproduce all the complexity we see in our tissue and our organs."" The whole manufacturing process is based on predefined computer models that are inspired from existing living tissues. These digital models, fully developed by Poietis, allow not only to organize the cells initially but also to anticipate how they will interact in time. Three weeks are required to reproduce the skin. For now, the company, which has about twenty employees (biologists, optical engineers, IT specialists …), uses two printers developed with INSERM and Alphanov laboratory, a member of the Bordeaux-based competitiveness cluster dedicated lasers. However, the company is already working on developing its own bioprinter, which should be operational within two years. As a first step, Poietis aims to develop its business by tapping into the enormous potential of testing in cosmetics and pharmaceutical research. ""This is why we first worked on the skin, it is a real opportunity for development,"" says Fabien Guillemot, who has just signed a strategic partnership with the global chemical giant, the German group BASF supplier of ingredients for cosmetics. BASF intends to use the advanced printing resolution of the Poietis' bioprinting technology to refine its skin model Mimeskin. The laser-assisted bioprinting technology will be used in a first step to allow for automated reproduction of Mimeskin, followed by more advanced models containing additional cell types. The company, which has just completed a first round of financing of 2.5 million euros (including a record of nearly 1 million euros via the crowdfunding platform WiSEED), aims to validate its first products and market them to research and testing centres by 2017."
New cell-based tests promise alternative to animal testing,"""Thousands of chemicals to which humans are exposed have inadequate data on which to predict their potential for toxicological effects,"" the study authors wrote in the journal Nature Communications. [1] However, traditional toxicity tests using animals are expensive and species differences mean they do not always accurately predict a chemical's effect on humans. Animal tests also raise ethical concerns about animal welfare. ""An important goal of the US Tox21 program is to use in vitro data as surrogates for in vivo toxicity to reduce animal testing,"" study co-author Ruili Huang of the NIH told AFP. But to achieve this, cell tests have to be just as predictive, or more so, of human toxicity as animal tests. After testing about 10,000 compounds, each in 15 different concentrations and on different cells, the team used their database to build predictive models for new chemical combinations. ""Compound clustering by structure similarity and activity profile similarity across the assays reveals structure-activity relationships that are useful for the generation of mechanistic hypotheses,"" explain the researchers who applied structural information and activity data to build predictive models for 72 in vivo toxicity end points. Researchers found that their models could predict toxicity for both humans and animals. ""Models based on in vitro assay data perform better in predicting human toxicity end points than animal toxicity, while a combination of structural and activity data results in better models than using structure or activity data alone. Our results suggest that in vitro activity profiles can be applied as signatures of compound mechanism of toxicity and used in prioritization for more in-depth toxicological testing."" These models may be ""a promising alternative to traditional animal toxicology studies."" However, further work must be done to validate and improve the models, which Huang said may never completely replace animal testing. It may, however, allow scientists to prioritise chemicals predicted to be most likely toxic for further tests using traditional methods, and so ""significantly reduce the amount of animal tests required,"" he said. Animal activists have welcomed the research. ""To understand more about human development and human diseases, the world's most forward thinking scientists are developing and implementing methods that supersede the crude use of animals,"" Julia Baines, science policy advisor of the organisation People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) told AFP. ""PETA welcomes the wealth of advanced non-animal research methodologies that are creating a brighter future for animals and human health."""
Nanomaterial additives improve performances of cosmetic packaging,"According to the Valencia-based Plastics Technology Centre (AIMPLAS), which participated in the NANOPACK project [1], results of the project's second phase that occurred in 2015 show that nanoparticles incorporated to plastic polymeric materials used for cosmetic packages can improve their properties. The research was performed with nanosized clays and metallic oxides. According to AIMPLAS, their incorporation into plastic polymers contributed to add value to plastic cosmetic packaging: – Nanoparticles improved the quality of the polymeric material, making unnecessary the use of additional additives and high filler percentages. – Nanosized additives allowed decreasing the amount of raw materials needed to elaborate the packaging, with subsequent cost saving when replacing the materials formed by multiple layers with monolayer materials. – Nanomaterial additives also provided plastic packaging with advanced properties, including a higher barrier to gases and best mechanical and thermal properties. ""Plastics are currently the most used material by the cosmetics industry for the package of their products, since they give several advantages regarding design freedom, lightness, resistance and lifespan. NANOPACK has achieved to prove that all these properties can be improved,"" commented AIMPLAS. The research programme also investigated the impact of nanoparticles when added to biopolymers (bioplastics) from renewable sources. In particular, NANOPACK assessed what categories of bioplastics best respond to the incorporation of nanomaterials, bearing in mind the specific requirements of cosmetic packaging."
Jean-Paul Marty Days: Skin microbiota in the focus,"Apart from the fact that 90% of our body is filled – not to say colonized – with bacteria, this gigantic microbial population raises many questions, one of which concerns the cosmetics industry more specifically: the adhesion of microorganisms on the surface of the skin. To Marie-Noëlle Bellon Fontaine, researcher at AgroParisTech, ""90% of microbial cells live fixed to biotic surfaces like the skin and the stomach, but also abiotic surfaces like ceramics and plastics."" Adhesion involves physico-chemical interactions. ""The pH regulates the adhesion, but also the topography and roughness of the surface. Depending on the type of surface, the microbial structure is modified with a sub- or overexpression of certain bacteria,"" the researcher completes. Then it can prove difficult to determine the conditions in which the microbiota must be studied, bearing in mind that the skin surface is not inert. The microbiota analysis, which started with the study of the intestinal microbiota, is a broad, complex subject that is already been researched for several years. Joël Doré, researcher at the French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA), confirms the need to develop standardized methods and collect samples most meticulously. ""Without a standardized method, it is impossible to issue any comparability, which often makes it burdensome to implement the protocols, whereas it is essential."" Metagenomic methods are used. By contrast, the research on the skin microbiota is much more recent than that of the intestinal microbiota. ""The skin has been studied for a bit less than ten years, knowing that we only cultivate 1% of known bacteria, and that we only know 0.1% of the bacteria present on the skin,"" explains Richard Martin of L'Oréal. It is believed that each square centimetre of our skin contains one million bacteria that exchange, communicate, and live together, which makes their analysis quite painstaking. We all have our own bacterial card defined according to our diet, living environment, climate, and even the way we came into the world. ""There is a huge difference between what we can observe in our laboratories and what actually happens on the skin,"" Richard Martin completes. Scientific research on the skin microbiota has only just started, and prospects must be much broader than what we can imagine today."
"Aging: Shiseido links ""sagging skin"" to impaired lymphatic function","With Japan having one the world's most aging population, there's no surprise that Japanese scientists be among the most advanced in the comprehension of ageing mechanisms. Cosmetics companies, of course, have a high interest in these issues. The study [1], conducted by the Tokyo-based cosmetics giant jointly with Professor Nobuyuki Takakura of the Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, also pointed out that ""pine cone extract"" could contribute to solve this problem as it has the effect of strengthening and normalizing the lymphatic vessels. Capillary vessels, which supply nutrients and oxygen, and lymphatic vessels, which are indispensable in collecting water and waste products, play important roles in the maintenance of healthy skin. Previous studies have found that impaired blood vessel and lymphatic function is a cause of skin aging. For instance, explains Shiseido, under the effect of ultraviolet rays or aging capillary and lymphatic vessels become slimsy, and this structural change prevents nutrients from spreading into every corner of skin. ""In addition, reduced lymphatic function causes prolonged inflammation, which results in wrinkles,"" says the company. So far, ""sagging"" was attributed to a decrease in collagen fibres or reduced elasticity, accumulation of subcutaneous fat and enlargement of adipocytes. However, the idea of Shiseido and Professor Takakura was that it might be associated to the state of lymphatic vessels. Actually, Professor Takakura has identified ""apelin"" [2] as a novel endogenous factor that enhances the function of lymphatic vessels, and furthermore, he discovered that apelin suppresses the accumulation of subcutaneous fat. Based on these study results, researchers set out to examine in detail the relationship between lymphatic function and accumulation of subcutaneous fat and found that: – fatty acids, which are present in the lymph, can destabilize lymphatic vessels and leak from the vessels, – leaked fatty acids directly promote the differentiation of adipocytes. Furthermore, it was found that apelin has a function to suppress the leakage of fatty acids from lymphatic vessels. Precisely, it is in saggy parts that subcutaneous fat accumulates. The study therefore concludes that ""sagging"" is due to an impaired lymphatic function that leads to an increase and accumulation of subcutaneous fat. In the wake of this discovery, Shiseido, in collaboration with Osaka University, initiated the screening of herbal components that would be able to mimic apelin, i.e. to enhance the lymphatic function and suppress subcutaneous fat accumulation. ""Pine cone extract"", collected from Pinus Sylvestris, which is distributed throughout Europe and Asia, was found to have the same ability to bind to the G protein-coupled receptor APJ, which is expressed in the cell membrane of lymphatic endothelial cells, and stabilizes lymphatic vessels. Tests were conducted for two months with a trial product formulated with cone pine extract and showed a reduction of the nasolabial and facial lines, as well as of neck sagging."
"""The time when botanists were analysing isolated plants has gone,"" Pr. Gilles Comte","Premium Beauty News - On the occasion of your keynote speech during the last edition of the European Days of Dermocosmetology organized by CED, you put forward the concept of chemical ecology for botanicals. Pr. Gilles Comte - Actually, a plant cannot be isolated from his environment. The time has gone when botanists we're collecting plants and analysing them outside their biological environment. At the Centre for Studies on Natural Substances, we are investigating the interactions within the whole ecosystem and especially interactions between plants and bacteria. Many types of bacteria are associated with plants and benefit from this association to get carbon and other nutrients. On the plant's side, the response varies according to each microbial source. While bacteria adapt very quickly to the physiological changes of the plant, the response from plants is slightly longer. There is a kind of chemical war between living organisms, based on weapons that are interaction mediators. Certain aspects are positive, allowing, for example, the selection of partners. Other interactions lead to the production of anti-bacterial, of anti-fungal substances by the plant to ensure its own protection and survival. Botanicals have native protections but the environment where they grow modifies them. We must keep in mind that plants unlike animals cannot run out from specific environmental conditions such as sun exposure, the presence of bacteria, humidity, etc. Premium Beauty News - What kind of analytical tools do you use to identify the interaction mediators? Pr. Gilles Comte - Several thousands of metabolites can be identified in animals while there are several hundreds of thousands metabolites in botanicals. An interdisciplinary approach is required to study of the interactions between living organisms and the chemical mediators of these interactions. The method combines chemistry, biochemistry, many areas of biology and genomics, in particular metabolomics. The aim is to identify the organs, tissues and even the cells that produce or receive chemical signals. We also follow how mediators evolve depending on conditions related to the environment. Premium Beauty News - What are the main applications of your research? Pr. Gilles Comte - Many sectors can be impacted by our researches since botanicals are widely used for food, as well as by the pharmaceuticals and cosmetics industries. Our researches also impact environmental studies. We are used to form partnerships with private companies. For example, a few years ago, we conducted a research on the rose and its varied chemical background to determine the best farming, harvesting, drying and processing parameters to obtain a the least variable product possible. As far as farming is concerned food, a lot of work focuses on food crops (corn, wheat, herbs). From an ecological point of view, we can respond to observations such as the fact that some plants are pollinated by insects while others, which are similar in appearance, are not. We can also explain how some plant species can limit the development of others by using interaction mediators that will limit germination or development. In the latter case, it is easy to figure out what are the potential applications in terms of bio- pesticides at a time when most chemical pesticides are being banned."
"Signs of aging appear in mid-20s, study finds","The findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences' July 6 issue are based on a group of 954 people born in New Zealand in 1972 or 1973. Researchers collected data on the subjects' kidney, liver and lung function, dental health, the blood vessels in the eyes as well as their metabolism and immune system function at age 26, 32 and 38. They also measured cholesterol, fitness levels and the length of the telomeres, which are the protective caps at the end of chromosomes that have been found to shorten with age. Using a total of 18 biological measurements, researchers determined a ""biological age"" for each participant at age 38 — with some registering under 30 and others appearing to be nearly 60. When scientists looked closely at the ones who had aged more quickly, they found signs of deterioration were apparent at age 26, the age when the first set of biological measurements were taken. Most of those in the group were aging at the expected rate of one biological year per chronological year, or even less. Others were aging as fast as three biological years per chronological year. Those whose bodies were aging faster also ""scored worse on tests typically given to people over 60, including tests of balance and coordination and solving unfamiliar problems,"" said the study. And when a group of university students at Duke (Durham, North Carolina) was asked to look at pictures of people in the group, they consistently rated as older those whose bodies were aging more quickly than the rest. Study authors said their findings pave the way for future tests that may be easier and cheaper to implement, so that people can find out how fast they are aging in their 20s, when they might be able to do something about it and possibly prevent age-related diseases. Previous research has shown that genes account for only about 20 percent of aging, leaving the rest up to health behaviors and the environment. ""That gives us some hope that medicine might be able to slow aging and give people more healthy active years,"" said senior author Terrie Moffitt, professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University."
The CED explores the different facets of plant neochemistry,"To Professor Gilles Comte, Director of the Centre for the study of natural substances, plants must be considered within their environment. They do not live alone, as they interact with predators, but they also have to cope with specific temperature, water stress, and soil composition conditions that have an influence on their own development. ""We focus on the interactions between plants and bacteria in particular. We are trying to find out what impact bacteria have on the metabolism of plants, but also how plants act on bacteria"". This chemical ecology is based on powerful analysis tools using genomics. Supercritical fluids, enzymatic aqueous extraction, use of NADES solvents… multiple strategies to obtain compounds of interest from plant materials are developing for more and more efficacy and less environmental impact. Solvent extraction is being replaced by greener techniques that provide compounds with enriched profiles. ""Thanks to CO2 supercritical extraction, it is possible to modulate the composition of the extracts obtained, which is not the case with hydrodistillation or solvent extraction,"" explains Karima Benaissi, Technical Manager at Innovation Fluides Supercritiques. As for Gattefossé, in 2012 the company committed to a broad research programme on new NADES solvents directly inspired from the way metabolites are solubilized in plant cells. ""Prospects are numerous, as it is a topic that was described in the literature very recently, in particular by Pr Robert Verpoorte, of the University of Leiden, Netherlands"", specifies Virginie Charton, Research Engineer at Gattefossé. Plants could not reveal their full potential without biotechnologies, which optimize solutions and offer more possibilities. ""We exploit the potential of plant roots using our 'plant milking' technology to reach the secondary metabolites of plants and get yields 300 times higher than those we would obtain with traditional cultures,"" clarifies Anaïs Thevenin-Gavoille, of PAT. All in all, this congress was very rich, as experts in process engineering, safety, efficacy and formulation were able to explore all the facets of plant neochemistry as well as its use in the cosmetics industry in a warm, friendly atmosphere."
From safety to efficacy: in vitro methods are becoming essential to the cosmetics industry,"New in vitro methods for evaluating the sensitization potential of raw materials have recently been developed to replace the now banned in vivo methods on animals. ""We have been waiting for progress in this field for 15 years. Several developments by Procter & Gamble, Givaudan, Kao, and Shiseido have put forward interesting strategies. And on February 5, 2015, the OECD adopted the first test in chemico to identify the sensitization potential of molecules. As for the European Union, it validated and recommended a skin sensitization method (h-CLAT) on the human THP1 cell line in March 2015,"" Béatrice Le Varlet explains. ""Replacing tests on animals requires a combination of strategies "", Bart De Wever adds. ""From this standpoint, alternatives on reconstructed epidermal skin models like the SENS-IS, SenCeeTox and EE methods present many advantages."" As a matter of fact, the 3D models that present perfect reproducibility, reliability, and relevance characteristics create unique opportunities to assess ingredients and finished products. ""Thanks to 3D models, we can obtain exclusive data as regards synergy of action, kinetics of application, and cellular and molecular mechanisms,"" specifies Marisa Meloni, CEO of Vitroscreen. The data collected thus seem more valuable than those obtained with tests on animals, and sometimes also with tests on human volunteers. In addition, 3D models are customizable and can be made to measure depending on the type of cells used, how old donors are, how long cultivation lasts, which stresses are induced… they pave the way for multiple innovation possibilities. ""It is only the beginning of what may be done with these models,"" confirms Amélie Thépot, CEO of LabSkin Creation. They resulted from new constraints related to the ban on animal testing… It now seems alternative methods have actually paved the way for other knowledge, although product toxicity assessment remains the industry's main concern. Download, here below, the speeches of the round table panellists: Latest advancements of in vitro evaluation of cosmetics – In vitro methods for assessing the sensitising potential of ingredients. – New in vitro models: 3D reconstructed human skin models. – In vitro tests for supporting cosmetic innovation and marketing claims."
"New generations of after-sun creams could protect better the skin, a new research suggests","Damages that UV light from the sun or from tanning beds cause to the skin and to the DNA in melanocytes, the cells that make the melanin that gives skin its colour, are well known. While melanin used to be considered as protecting the skin by blocking harmful UV light, several studies have suggested that melanin could also associated with skin cell damage. In a study published online by the journal Science on February 20, a team of researchers led by Douglas E. Brash, clinical professor of therapeutic radiology and dermatology at Yale School of Medicine [1], found that melanin had both carcinogenic and protective effects. Actually, the study showed that the same kind of DNA damage occurs in melanocytes during sun exposure and hours after the sun exposure ended. ""What's surprising here, is that melanin is actually doing something that can cause cancer,"" said Pr. Brash, also a member of Yale Cancer Centre. The researchers first exposed mouse and human melanocyte cells to radiation from a UV lamp. The radiation caused a type of DNA damage known as a clobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD), preventing the information carried by DNA from being read correctly. To the researchers' surprise, the melanocytes not only generated CPDs immediately but continued to do so hours after UV exposure ended. On the contrary, cells without melanin generated CPDs only during the UV exposure. The researchers next tested the extent of damage that occurred after sun exposure by preventing normal DNA repair in mouse samples. They found that half of the CPDs in melanocytes were ""dark CPDs"" - CPDs created in the dark. ""If you look inside adult skin, melanin does protect against CPDs. It does act as a shield. But it is doing both good and bad things,"" said Douglas Brash. In searching for an explanation of these results, Sanjay Premi, associate research scientist in the Brash laboratory, discovered that the UV light activated two enzymes that combined to ""excite"" an electron in melanin. The energy generated from this process - known as chemiexcitation - was transferred to DNA in the dark, creating the same DNA damage that sunlight caused in daytime. While noting that news of the carcinogenic effect of melanin is disconcerting, the researchers also said the slowness of chemiexcitation may allow time for new preventive tools, such as an ""evening-after"" sunscreen designed to block the energy transfer. Such a cream, they say, would prevent DNA damage that occurs when UV rays activate two enzymes that send melanin haywire in the chemiexcitation process. ""We can imagine designing chemicals that dissipate that energy before it has a chance to transfer to the DNA. And in fact there are chemicals like that that exist and we have used some of them in the researches. But you can imagine getting better ones that would be practical to use on the skin,"" added Pr. Brash."
Study takes step towards a pill able to turn white fat into brown fat,"Using human stem cells, the team generated a technique to screen for compounds that are able to achieve this important feat of fat colour transfer and have already identified two of these compounds. While it's not certain how the no-more-treadmill-pill would be concocted and whether it would be safe and effective, it's an important first step in the fight against obesity. That fat cells can be converted is well-known. For example, a study at the University of Montreal [1] identified retinoic acid-a derivative of Vitamin A-as being able to turn fat cells brown in mice, but the Harvard team says their discovery is more significant. ""What we were really impressed by is that there are some compounds that have this same kind of effect when they are administered to animals, but when you remove them, the effect goes away,"" says Chad Cowan, a principal faculty member of HCSI. ""But what we saw here was a stable conversion."" Still, says Cowan, it's not certain what the long term effects on the metabolism and immune system could be, although he is encouraged by the success of the two compounds in mice. Brown fat is considered the ""good fat"" because unlike white fat, it's capable of generating heat by oxidizing fatty acid. To ignite this process, no exercise is necessary on the part of the individual, so brown fat cells increase the basal, or resting, metabolism. Researchers have come to believe that differing proportions of brown fat could explain why some eat more than others without gaining weight and without considerable exercise efforts. Other studies have indicated that it's possible to create brown fat in human participants by keeping their living environment at a cool 19 degrees C (66F) for a minimum of one month [2]. The HSCI study was published in the journal Nature Cell Biology. [3]"
Bee propolis offers hope for hair regrowth: study,"The resin-like material is used by honeybees to seal small crevices in their hives. Its anti fungal and anti bacterial properties are already documented but according to the research team [1], it could also contain important clues for reversing hair loss in humans. Spring-boarding on recent research suggesting propolis could promote the growth of cells that contribute to hair growth, Ken Kobayaski and his team were curious to find out if it could actually create new locks. They prepped their mice by either shaving or waxing them, and in both cases those that had received a topical application of propolis grew their fur back faster than those that didn't. Importantly, the number of cells involved in hair growth increased after propolis had been applied to the skin. ""Propolis stimulates hair growth by inducing hair keratinocyte proliferation,"" concluded the researchers. While propolis was only tested on mice that were capable of growing fur rather than balding mice, the research team points out that hair loss is often the result of inflammation. Because it contains anti-inflammatory elements, the researchers say they expect propolis to reverse hair loss, although they acknowledge that further testing is necessary. Propolis, which also has antifungal properties, was used to treat inflammation and wounds in ancient times. The study was published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry."
DSM quantifies stratum corneum variations in different skin ethnicities,"Stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the epidermis, is known for its barrier function to protect underlying tissue from infection, dehydration, chemicals and mechanical stress. Paradoxically, although the face is generally the part of the body most exposed to the external environment, facial skin is particularly sensitive and its stratum corneum is thinner than elsewhere. Studies conducted by DSM Personal Care also found large differences in hydration and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) values on different parts of the face. Moreover, these differences appear to vary among different ethnic groups! In partnership with the University of Limpopo, South Africa, Newtone Technologies, France, and AVR Consulting, UK, DSM Personal Care has run an extensive study to generate detailed hydration and TEWL mapping of the faces of Chinese, Caucasian, Indian and Black African subjects. A special algorithm was developed to automatically detect skin pixels and interpolate a measured value for each of the subjects after superimposing the various bio-instrumental data on the images. As a result, full continuous facial skin hydration and TEWL colour maps are now available for the first time. Not only skin hydration and TEWL vary on the face, but there are also remarkable differences between the different ethnicities. ""Moisturizing creams need to consider the different characteristics of various facial anatomical locations as well as the various requirements of the skin of different ethnicities. Our results will support and boost the deeper understanding of the different needs of different skin types,"" commented Rainer Voegeli, Senior Scientist Skin Biology at DSM and one of the authors of the findings. DSM researchers also investigated the role of skin pigmentation in facial stratum corneum barrier integrity and repair capacity. In cooperation with the Photobiology Laboratory, Medusa Campus, UL, South Africa and AVR Consulting, UK, DSM Personal Care performed a study on stratum corneum barrier characteristics among Caucasian, Albino African and Black African subjects to gain deeper insights in this field. The study revealed that pigmentation does not appear to play a role in the facial stratum corneum barrier integrity and repair capability. On the contrary, Albino African subjects' cheek stratum corneum barrier integrity and repair capability proved to be superior to that of Black African and Caucasian subjects. Also the stratum corneum of the Albino African group was found to be approximately 67% thicker (p≤0.001) on the cheek compared with the Caucasian group and 35% thicker than the Black African subjects. ""Such drastic differences among different skin ethnicities confirms the demand for dedicated solutions to answer the needs of millions of consumers worldwide,"" said Rainer Voegeli. According to DSM, thicker stratum corneum and relatively faster repair capacity on the cheeks of the Albino African subjects suggests that their skin has responded to an external UV challenge to strengthen essential skin barrier functions in order to protect the skin against UV radiation. However, the reasons for these findings are currently under investigation at the biochemical level."
World's oldest people share no genetic secrets: study,"To date, there are 74 supercentenarians alive worldwide, and 22 live in the United States. Supercentenaians are aged 110 and older. In an attempt to uncover the genetic secrets behind such a long life, researchers from the Stanford University, California, have sequenced the complete genome of 17 of them. The study, led by Hinco Gierman, was published in the November 12 issue of the open-access journal PLOS ONE. US scientists said they've found no genetic secrets shared between this small group of 17 supercentenarians. They did not find any rare variation producing proteins that could explain their longevity. They found, in one of these supercentenarians, a genetic mutation linked to a specific heart disease, but which had little or no effect on his health. Even though no genetic clues emerged in this study, scientists said they would make their analysis available to the public as a resource for future research. Indeed, the hope of finding an answer did not seem to have entirely vanished. Actually, several private and public laboratories and universities are conducting researches on this source of youth, pointed a survey from the Pew Research Center last year. According to some researchers, medicine could make such dramatic progresses during the next decades that human life expectancy would grow further what is currently considered as a biological limit. Manufacturers of cosmetic products are also highly interested in such scientific forays in the biology of ageing. They are also keen to adopt up-to-date technologies and knowledge for developing their products, as shown during the latest Congress of the International Federation of Societies of Cosmetic Chemists (IFSCC) in Paris. Declining birth rates combined with sharp increase in life expectancy mean that the American population is aging rapidly. According to the Census Bureau, one in five Americans will be over 65 by 2050 and at least 400,000 will be centenarians. In Japan and Europe, the aging of the population is even more advanced. These changes will have a significant impact on health systems and consumption patterns."
"IFSCC 2014: The cosmetics industry takes to ""omics"" sciences","Following in the footsteps of genomics, the study of all genes, ""omics"" sciences are developing and imposing themselves both in medical research and in cosmetics manufacturers' R&D departments. ""These technologies give access to the different components of living organisms, from the DNA to the metabolite, the small molecule produced due to the cell's activity"", Dominique Bernard, Omics Platform Manager at L'Oréal Research & Innovation, told the AFP. In practice, cosmetology resorts to omics sciences to understand the skin's cellular mechanisms and identify action ""targets"" to develop new products. The use of omics boomed with the development of powerful analysis techniques such as DNA microarrays. These molecular biology tools, which are always based on a holistic approach, are named with neologisms formed according to the same model, all along the chain of components of the living organisms. Transcriptomics analyses how a genome is transcribed into proteins via messenger RNAs (messenger ribonucleic acid). Proteomics explores all the proteins produced by a genome. Metabolomics is dedicated to all the metabolites in a cell. ""It gets more complex each time: we start with 21,000 genes, but we end up with several hundreds of thousands of proteins"", the biologist underlines. Omics can thus generate masses of information on the skin and hair biology. For manufacturers, the difficulty is to manage to pick out the relevant elements to be able to market a product that meets consumers' expectations. ""We need to set up bioinformatics systems to extract the most useful information from these big data in order to, for example, analyse the different skin types and subtypes all around the world,"" Dominique Bernard explains. ""We are also trying to find what we call ""targets"", because once you have identified a target, you can develop new molecules capable of modulating that target, and therefore develop new cosmetic products"", he adds – like new anti-aging actives. Omics technologies will also help determine ""signatures"" specific to certain types of aging, chronoaging or photoaging resulting from repeated exposure to the sun, and then select actives to try and ""offset"" these signatures. ""What is wonderful with the skin is that it is very easily accessible"", notes the biologist. ""We have access to its surface and we can already get a lot of information without having to get invasive"". Perspiration is another valuable source of information for cosmetics manufacturers. ""If you know the composition of perspiration, you can develop makeup that will last long on the skin"", explains Claudie Willemin, President of the Société française de cosmétologie (the French Society of Cosmetology), which held the congress. ""You can develop products that prevent the skin from shining, for example in countries with high humidity levels"", she adds. Scientists are also increasingly interested in the microbiome, these hundreds of millions of microorganisms, such as bacteria or fungi, that are present on the skin's surface and with which human cells permanently ""interact"". Three scientific prizes are also awarded at the IFSCC congress. This year the jury rewarded: – Haruka Goto, of Pola, who received the Basic Research Award for her work on the hBD-3, an antimicrobial peptide which plays a key role in the acne flare-up during the premenstrual stage – Alban Muller, who won the Applied Research Award for his collaboration with the Université of Rouen, France, and the Payan Bertrand SA perfume company on the development of a new strategy to protect the skin against fragrance allergens. The consortium identified and implemented an ingredient of the protein group of prolamins which forms an imperceptible, odorless, colorless film on the skin and protects against the allergens present in a perfume when it is sprayed. – Ezure Tomonobu, of Shiseido, who won the Poster Award for a novel approach to anti-aging facial skincare based on the reconstruction of dermal anchoring structures for a toning effect on the face. For its comeback edition in France, the IFSCC congress gathered about 1,500 participants from 40 countries. ""We did not want to deal with scientific advances according to the different fields (anti-aging, hair, sun care…), but to really show that cosmetology involves expertise and knowledge beyond the sole cosmetics sector's boundaries"", Mrs Willemin highlighted. The next IFSCC congress will be held from September 20 to 23, 2015 in Zurich, Switzerland."
Clinical analysis: The value of quantitative measures in cosmetics,"Initially, this technique was developed for fundamental research. Methods developed in this context being now sufficiently robust and proven, Phylogene undertook to adapt it to the analysis of large molecules. To this end, the MS Phylogene platform uses an original configuration of mass spectrometry coupled to high pressure liquid nano-chromatography (nanoLC-MS/MS). The objective is to achieve a quantitative comparison of all the proteins in two complex samples. In concrete terms, samples of skin explants, reconstituted skin, D-Squame, fibroblasts, keratinocytes or other biopsies after being subjected to an active are compared with their placebo control. The platform is powerful enough to be able to identify 200 to 2000 different proteins per sample and measure their relative amounts. Comparing this data with the data coming from the placebo gives a first indication on the possible (and sometimes unexpected) effects of molecules studied. ""The platform is of great interest for applications in cosmetics,"" explained Gilbert Skorski, President of Phylogene. ""Proteins are, indeed, the primary players in the cell's function and structure."" Hence the value of knowing the impact of a formula or of an active on these proteins, especially with the current ban on animal testing. ""Techniques looking for activated genes move into the background, because molecules expressed from the genes are not directly identified by these techniques,"" he added. Another advantage put forward by Phylogene is the quantitative nature of the technique. ""We get immediate information on the impact and intensity of the resulting phenomena,"" emphasised Skorski. The information of course, needs to be analysed and interpreted afterwards. Finally, the fact that this technique is not targeted enables to not limit research to preconceived ideas that one may have on the effect of an active, but on the contrary to understand what is happening globally, positively or negatively. ""This avoids having to deal with the extra costs relative to the late discovery of unexpected negative effects of an active, which was interesting beforehand."" Conversely, good surprises can also emerge just like unexpected effects, yet of particular interest. All this, according to Phylogene, in less than a month's time for a complete screening of the active. Once that step is completed, it is possible to perform a bio-informatic and statistical analysis to identify the metabolic pathways and the activated biological or molecular functions. Phylogene has developed for this purpose the Coravalid™ module. ""This step is extremely important, because given the mass of information, without these additional analyses, experience shows that people would tend to only focus on what they already know and miss the new things corresponding to unexpected effects. There is a serious risk of losing the benefit of the relative quantification of these proteins,"" explained Skorski. ""Finally it is also possible to target multiple proteins, identified as biomarkers and thus to monitor the specific effect of the active, or to perform the same approaches on metabolites generated by these proteins, or to study the post-translational changes of the proteins,"" he concluded."
"Hydration, barrier function and tissue structures on the programme of the IFSCC 2014 Congress","Premium Beauty News - What are the main themes of the IFSCC's scientific programme? Patrice Bellon - Six themes will be developed during this congress, which will be taking place in France again after a 16 year absence. We have been working for the three past years on a scientific programme built around beauty and skin protection. The programme will include: ""Beauty and Life Science"", ""Beauty and colour"", ""Beauty and surface shield: physicochemistry"", ""Beauty and sensoriality"", ""Beauty and protective strategy within the skin"" and a newly integrated theme in an IFSCC congress: ""Beauty and society"". We are therefore opening the door to sustainable development and corporate social responsibility. Alain Meybeck - Well-being is also put forward. More and more works in soft science, like psychology, sociology highlight the importance of consumers' perceptions, their feelings, their emotions in the assessment of a product. Premium Beauty News - How did you select the oral communications and posters? Patrice Bellon - We received 743 abstracts from more than 2,000 authors, among which, 30% from academics, 30% from ingredient and test suppliers and 40% from brands. Each abstract was submitted to three reviewers among a selection of 77 experts. Some subjects are studied a lot, like hydration and the barrier function or the tissue structure, and some are emerging like those related to sustainable development, quality of life. In its choice of 72 oral communications, the Scientific Committee made a point of respecting a representativeness of all geographic regions, all business sizes and a balance between public and private research. Alongside big names in cosmetics, small start-ups will be able to express themselves. Alain Meybeck - For each session, an introductory lecture will be conducted by internationally recognized professors in the world of beauty. I would also like to stress on the quality of the 464 selected posters which, for the organizers, are as important as oral communications and will be the subject of exchanges of views during the breaks, which were voluntarily lengthened. Premium Beauty News - What type of visitors are you expecting? Patrice Bellon - Usually this congress is followed at 60% by R&D, 16% by teachers and scholars, 7% by managers and 7% by marketing. France is well represented with 42% of participants, as is Asia (with 17% of Japanese and 8% Koreans), and Brazil with 6%. Alain Meybeck - This year, the fact that the congress is taking an interest in Beauty and Society, and is also taking into account issues related to well-being, makes it an event that can also be of great interest to marketing related teams. It is a major moment for the trade and a way to be informed of recent developments in the cosmetics field."
Reconstructed custom skin models for cosmetic assessments,"Premium Beauty News - You created LSC early 2014. What services do you offer? Amélie Thépot - LabSkin Creations was created in collaboration with Dr. Odile Damour to promote the legacy in tissue reconstruction of the Laboratoire des Substituts Cutanés HCL/CNRS (Hôpital Edouard Herriot, Lyon) has been developing in clinical research [1] since 1988. We use a ""full-thickness"" reconstructed skin model (dermis and epidermis) to offer custom services for the assessment on the efficacy of ingredients or skin care products. The patented cell culture medium is based on a single matrix composed of essential components in the extracellular matrix (ECM): collagen and chitosan insolubilized glysosaminoglycanes. This porous matrix was optimized to recreate a physiological environment conducive to cellular in vivo and in vitro colonization. A functional dermis is faithfully reproduced, in which all the elements of the ECM are synthesized and placed in an organized manner. Hence, interactions between the two compartments have enabled for the first time the in vitro deposition of a functional and organized tissue, whereas until now, elastin was only found in a soluble form in the culture medium. [2] Premium Beauty News - What are the particularities of the latest models developed? Amélie Thépot - This model is the first to be flexible and adaptable to the needs, it is a constant source of innovation and scientific inspirations. The cell types used, the age and anatomical origin of cells (young vs. aged / photo-exposed vs. photo-protected), the culture time, the moment and type of application of the active (topical vs. systemic) are all possible variables just like the different stresses to apply, like pollution, UV exposure, mechanical stress... For the Laboratoire des Substituts Cutanés (Laboratory of Skin Substitutes) and LabSkin Creations this reconstructed skin model is an ongoing source of innovation and scientific inspirations. Our latest advances relate to models mimicking senescence over very long cultivation times, up to 120 days, while standard cultures stop after 42 days. We are therefore able to test actives throughout the whole tissue reconstruction and substantiate their efficacy on dermal and epidermal reconstruction from a mechanistic and biological point of view. We have also developed ""chimeric"" reconstructed skin models based on combinations of cells from donors of different ages, highlighting the dialogue between the different skin compartments and their involvement in the damage associated with aging and particularly on the reconstruction and maturation of the dermo-epidermal junction. The real benefit we offer our clients is the development of skin models exactly tailored to their needs and the issues to be addressed. Premium Beauty News - How does it exactly work? Amélie Thépot - Just like haute couture, we wanted to create the concept of ""Haute Culture"" with three sequential steps: 1) The design and development of the reconstructed skin model following the client's specifications and adapted to the tested product of interest: the 3D Skin Designer®. 2) The production and delivery of the custom reconstructed skin model with the product application supplied by the client: the 3D Skin Factory®. 3) The observation of the active's overall effect using histological staining, which enables to guide additional research and further explorations: the 3D Skin Scanner®. Then, two types of approaches are proposed: a tissue approach with the study of skin markers using immuno-detection and quantitative analysis using image processing and a molecular approach. It focuses on the modulation, by the active ingredient, of the genes and / or proteins expression of interest in the reconstructed skin model. This is performed through proteomic analysis or genomic analysis. An illustrated and quantified scientific report is provided with evidence of the product's efficacy, describing the protocol, summarizing and analysing all the results, providing all the images and videos generated and the associated quantitative analyses. Premium Beauty News - Who are your clients? Amélie Thépot - Our offer is aimed at both suppliers of cosmetic actives and finished products. However we also have clients in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Academic research also has a keen interest in our techniques to implement more fundamental studies. During the post IFSCC day (31 October 2014), a visit of the Laboratoires des Substituts Cutanés and of LabSkin Creations will be scheduled."
"Sensory 2014: emotion, the key factor of marketing success?","""In addition to researchers working on the sensory, we wanted to open the debate to marketing departments, consumers and product designers, and thus make it an inspiring event"", explains Frédéric Le Gall, the congress organizer. ""Emotions lie at the core of perception, communication, motivation and decision-making. They bear an influence on the sensory experience, and they promote action,"" explained Arnaud Aubert, professor at the University of Tours, France, at the start of the debate. Emotional priming associated with sensory input thus seems to act on sensory feelings on a global level. ""People who are made to see pleasant images such as baby faces for a few milliseconds will then pay increased attention to things,"" specifies David Sander, Professor at the University of Geneva, Switzerland. It has therefore become a strategic challenge to take consumers' emotions into account. Several approaches seem possible, and everyone agrees with the fact that, as Arnaud Aubert states, ""it is necessary to adopt a multidimensional approach with multidisciplinary research"". Among the study tools available, some favour physiological measurements and assess cardiac coherence, record voices, or study the zygomaticus major muscle, while others base their research on questionnaires and interviews, knowing that a large number of individuals (between 60 and 200) should be involved to get interpretable and reproducible results. Indeed, emotions are multiple, and although Alain Finkel considers ""95 % of our emotions actually come down to the four basic ones, that is, anger, fear, joy and sadness"", there are emotions integrated to the product, and also others that are incidental, and can be related to the emotions triggered by music in a store, or by the facial expression of a sales assistant. This rich world fascinates researchers, and marketing departments are starting to make it their own. Can we not already see relaxing, boosting products on the market? They might well be the first of future claims for products conveying joy and elation. The next edition of Sensory will be held at the end of June 2016."
"""Research in cosmetology is going beyond the borders of the cosmetic sector,"" Claudie Willemin, SFC","Premium Beauty News - Five months before the kick-off of this major event in the trade, what are the perspectives for the upcoming Congress? Claudie Willemin - Thanks to the involvement of all stakeholders, the congress is looking extremely promising. We have had a very large influx of abstracts: 750 in total, coming from 34 different countries, with a notable presence of France, Japan, but also emerging countries like Brazil and Korea. Don't forget that authors only commit to communicate recent work, which hasn't yet been the subject of prior publications, thus giving the event its innovative character. The congress will be preceded by a day dedicated to ""Predictive methods"" and ""Regulatory compliance"" workshops. In addition this year - and this is a first - the congress will continue with two post IFSCC days, enabling to meet experts. The first one will be organized by the Cosmetic Valley with the following perfume thematic: oenology and cosmetic science, and the other, under the aegis of the European Centre of dermocosmetology (CED), which will focus on textile and tissue engineering. Hence, a perfect opportunity for the cosmetic world, to focus for a whole week on science and progress in its field of interest, quite a unique opportunity indeed. Premium Beauty News - What will be the highlights of the Congress? Claudie Willemin - The common thread of these four days is ""cosmetics, innovation and performance for beauty and well-being"" with a format alternating plenary lectures, oral conferences, poster presentations. During the four days of the conference, six plenary lectures animated by international experts are planned followed by 72 oral lectures around six themes illustrating some aspects of research in cosmetology, such as beauty and colour, beauty and sensoriality, beauty and society... We want to show that research in cosmetology requires expertise and knowledge that go beyond the boundaries of the mere cosmetic sector. In addition, more than 650 posters will be exposed and to facilitate exchanges and discussions between scientists, break times will be extended. As for the social programme, it will focus on beauty and the art of living in Paris, including a private tour of the Louvre Museum, a dinner under the pyramid and the closing ceremony, which will take place at the Museum of Fairground Arts. Premium Beauty News - In terms of visitorship, is the current number registrations promising? Claudie Willemin - We are very confident, the number of registrations is already very high. The final programme of the conference will be available early July."
EU-project aims to develop environment-friendly production processes for cosmetics,"Cosmetics companies are increasingly interested in new environment-friendly production processes and in novel cosmetic ingredients with a lower environmental footprint. This is also the aim of the project OPTIBIOCAT [1], which is backed by around 7 million euros of EU funding. The project brings together a broad interdisciplinary team of researchers, academics and industry experts, with 16 partners from Italy, France, Germany, Greece, Portugal, Sweden, the Netherlands and Finland, covering the entire development process, from genome and microbial mining to application. Most prominent industry partner is Greek natural cosmetics producer Korres. The aim of the four-year project is to replace resource and energy-intensive chemical processes currently used in the cosmetic industry through discovering and optimising novel enzymatic biocatalysts. The OPTIBIOCAT researchers will develop biocatalysts requiring fewer steps in the production of components as well as lower-temperatures (50-60°C) compared to those of chemical processes (up to 160°C). ""The environmental footprint for the production of the identified antioxidants will be significantly reduced with our innovative biocatalysts,"" says Vincenza Faraco from the University of Naples, who leads the OPTIBIOCAT consortium."
"""Physicochemical properties are a key to the efficacy of cosmetics,"" Stéphanie Briançon, CNRS","Premium Beauty News - The cosmetic industry is particularly interested in your fields of study? Stéphanie Briançon - The means of delivery for active substances is a topic of great interest. Reach the desired target and ensure that the administered product is efficient: it concerns not only the cosmetic but also the pharmaceutical industry, the medicine field–in the context of anti cancer therapies, and the veterinary field for topical applications. We are working on liposomes which, indeed, are pretty old systems since the first patent dates back to 1964, but which are still relevant, being universal and effective. Our research focuses on their manufacturing and stabilization by limiting the use of solvents and by using biocompatible materials. Uses include encapsulation of anticancer molecules or the development of hydrating forms for the ophthalmic route. We also focus on nanoparticles developed from biodegradable polymer-type polyesters (caprolactone, polylactic acids), polysaccharides and lipids based on triglyceride mixtures. The targeted particle sizes are between 200 and 400nm. They are used in the perfume area to encapsulate the fragrance and incorporate it in various formulations. We also work in collaboration with dermatologists to use nanoparticles as vectors in immunobiological diagnosis tests, from contact allergies to perfumes. One of our research objectives for these particular methods of formulation is to reduce the inflammatory potential of molecules. Premium Beauty News - At scientific congresses, there seems to be a proliferation of communications on Pickering emulsions. Your laboratory is also working on this topic, are products formulated that way going to be marketed? Stéphanie Briançon - Since 2006, we have a doctoral student continuously studying this topic, which is indeed interesting more and more the scientific community. Pickering emulsions formulated with no surfactants but with solid particles in the interface between oil and water have specific behaviours. We have observed with silica particles, some modulations of hydrophilic of lipophilic passage of actives in the stratum corneum [1] [2]. This is very interesting to increase the penetration of an active or decrease the transcutaneous passage of irritating molecules like chemical filters. We presented at the IFSCC 2012 results on caffeine and retinol [3]. We investigate from organic particles like silica but also polymeric particles, where we seek to generate in the same step, nanoparticles and Pickering emulsion. This type of emulsion is an interesting study model for us because their interface is not completely solid. Commercially, they are still underdeveloped because they have the drawback of not having a pleasant skin touch, at least for those based on mineral particles. Premium Beauty News - Skin decontamination is another topic of interest for your lab. Skin decontamination and skin de-pollution: could bridges be considered between these two topics? Stéphanie Briançon - It is still too early to make assumptions. We are at the beginning of our work with a large part of it dedicated to the implementation of a methodology and with finding ways of dosing chemical ions at the skin level. We are working with the DGA on organophosphate molecules [4] [5] and the CEA on radio elements. We are at the understanding stage: how do ions penetrate the skin and how are they stored in a skin layer, with which kinetics? How can the decontamination of molecules or ions be assayed? To this end, we use such techniques as atomic spectroscopy and ion chromatography. Premium Beauty News - How do you see the future of formulation? Stéphanie Briançon - The future will very much depend on the development of analysis and characterization methods and on the efficacy of products in relation with their physicochemical properties. These methods can combine chemical, biochemical or mechanical data. We are fortunate to have in Lyon the IVTV platform. A tour of the laboratory is planned during the post IFSCC Day organized on October 30, 2014 by the European Centre of Dermocosmetics (CED), with whom we are partnering, and which brings together in one place high-tech tools and experts in various fields, from biology to mechanics. We have much to learn from others. Exchanges are essential as well as partnerships with industrialists and foreign universities. In the Lyon area, the CED, of which we are a member, includes many actors with whom we are in contact."
"""In a near future, we will be able to anticipate tissue degradation,"" Thierry Hoc, Ecole Centrale de Lyon","Premium Beauty News - What are the main findings of your works on cell tissues? Thierry Hoc - I started my career studying the plasticity of metals and how dislocations could brittle materials. [1] Lyon being a region where there is intensive research on living organisms, when I arrived at the Ecole Centrale de Lyon in 2009, I focused on themes related to bio-engineering with a mechanic's approach. Our first works showed that bone balance was governed by the biochemical environment of the bone but also by the mechanical strain undergone by cells. Our experiments revealed for example, that cells had low sensitivity to compression while shear improved their development. This mechanical environment is therefore crucial in the aging process of tissues leading to specific architectures. Some connective tissue create, for example, some microstructures with very conveniently oriented collagen and elastin fibres to withstand the mechanical strain associated with the in vivo environment that one goes through every day. We observed from mechanical tests on collagen fibres, in the presence of elastin fibres, that the mechanical strength was fully linked to collagen fibres, while the tissue springback was linked to elastin fibres. These works have direct applications in the treatment of bone disease (brittle bone disease, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis) in the treatment of parietal hernias but also in tissue engineering which requires better characterizing the environment of the cell. All this data is taken into account in skin cultures with the addition of mechanical strain. Skin is also an excellent marker of aging as Prof. Hassan Zahouani demonstrated. Tension lines at the skin surface reflect the mechanical behaviour and the morphology of more or less deep wrinkles. It is in this context that we use the skin as a laboratory for aging, and that we look if there are some existing correlations between the mechanical properties of bones and the morphology of the skin, in cases of osteoarthritis, is the skin more or less wrinkled, are tension lines different, has elastin gone...? A number of promising and open questions. Premium Beauty News - Since 2012, you are in charge of the equipment of excellence for the engineering and aging of living tissues (ingénierie et vieillissement des tissus vivants or IVTV). Can you explain what this vast project, selected by the Ministry of Higher Education and Research, is about? Thierry Hoc - The IVTV platform, located in the Ecole Centrale de Lyon and in the Health Cluster of St. Etienne is the only centre of its kind in Europe. It aggregates 14 research laboratories, two hospitals, nine private–sector companies, including four operating in cosmetics, around high-tech tools, coupling mechanics and multi-scale imaging to help characterize the chemical, mechanical, topographical properties of the different tissues (bone, teeth, cartilage, skin, ligaments, arteries, muscles...), to individually follow their aging and make correlations between observations performed. Skin being easily accessible, we are seeking to understand if its aging reflects the aging of other tissues. The platform was launched in December 2012, it offers training services and provision of equipment but also services. Exchanges between the 170 permanent members of the platform are frequent and the development of cross-functional skills is a priority. Premium Beauty News - What will, the industry - including cosmetic manufacturers - be using the IVTV platform for and what are the current results? Thierry Hoc - Operational studies have begun a few months ago; to date several oral presentations have been made, highlighting a great potential. For example, confocal microscopy enables to monitor how soft tissue composed of collagen and elastin respond when they are subjected to mechanical stress, how fibres react, how they redirect themselves. Raman spectroscopy helps monitor the penetration of actives at different depths; ultra-sound propagation speed measurements in tissues will enable to better characterize the skin according to its age. The field is vast and areas of application are dermatology, orthopedics and cardiovascular, but we always keeping a key thread on understanding, on the product/tissue interaction and with a partnership between the doctor/engineer and the biologist. A visit of the IVTV laboratory is planned during the post IFSCC day, organized by the European Centre of Dermocosmetology (CED), on October 31, 2014. Premium Beauty News - How do you think aging could be addressed in 20 or 30 years? Thierry Hoc - to date scientific advances enable to reconstruct the skin, bones, arteries. I believe that in a near future, we could, maybe not make human beings bionic, but anticipate human tissue degradation and through cell therapy, overcome these unwanted changes in order to locally regenerate damaged tissues."
HelioScreen aims at more reliable in vitro sunscreen tests thanks to new robot,"""The spread is a key parameter of the in vitro evaluation of solar products. We worked for several months on the development of our HD-Spreadmaster robot. The initial technology is based on a six engines robot made by the Sysaxes company, to which was added a silicone finger especially designed to reproduce the hardness, the pressure and the movement of a human finger. We also added a thermal chamber to maintain the required temperature at the surface of the plates,"" explains Sébastien Miksa, laboratory manager at HelioScreen. According to HelioScreen, their innovation shows better performances, in particular in terms of time, compared to a conventional application by an operator (up to two times faster, announces the company) and a reproducibility that is improved by a factor of 2-3, depending on the product's texture. HelioScreen adds that the system has been validated by leading French cosmetics companies and was presented to the ISO working group on sun protection test methods (ISO/TC 217/WG 7). HelioScreen already uses the HD-Spreadmaster robot, which is available for purchase, for performing SPF (Sun Protection Factor) in vitro assessments for some customers. ""We have a strong training and in vitro testing business in France. We are now expanding it into Asia with the opening of our branch in Bangkok,"" adds Sébastien Miksa. HelioScreen is a small company that does not lack of impetuosity or ideas to meet the requirements of in vitro SPF measurement for the growing sunscreens market. Founded in 1999 by Dominique Lutz, HelioScreen has specialized since its creation in the performance of in vitro sunscreen tests. It was one of the first companies to market PMMA [1] plates, which advantageously replaced the then usual applications on Transpore®. While the plates were initially sand blasted, HelioScreen impulse the shift to moulded Helioplate HD6 PMMA plates, which are now a must to meet the ISO 24443:2012 standard and the FDA Rule 2011. In 2013, more than 130,000 HD6 substrates were sold worldwide."
Skin and light: from protection to action,"Sun exposure is appreciated for its effect on morale and also because it allows for the epidermal synthesis of vitamin D. But its dangers are also increasingly known. ""UVs are responsible for many biological effects both beneficial and harmful to the body. At the cellular level, UVs act at the nuclear, membrane, and cytoplasmic level,"" explained Professor François Aubin (University of Franche Comté). UVAs, which represent 95% of the spectrum, are the ones with the deepest penetration into the skin. More recently, the effects of near infra-reds on photo-induced skin ageing have been highlighted. ""50% of free radicals are produced in the visible and near infra-red. These wavelengths between 760 and 1400 nm impact the dermis at high doses causing the metalloproteinase-1 over-expression in dermal fibroblasts,"" underlined Jürgen Lademann (Charity Universitätsmedizin Berlin). Lademann also evidenced that near infra-reds regulated highly influential genes in skin homeostasis. He therefore advocated for a protection across the whole light spectrum range and not only centred on UVs. Providing formulations with a UVA and UVB protection is already a requirement. ""The product's dosage form plays an important role, it will determine the amount of product to apply. It is shown that products that spread easily are associated both with a low variation of SPFs and a positive sensory evaluation, which leads, in turn, to the application of a larger amount of lotion,"" noted Marc Pissavini (Coty Lancaster), while observing that people always remained below the 2mg/cm² mark required by the standard methods of assessment for the determination of the sun protection factor. Pissavini therefore recommended for the use of an ""in vivo veritas SPF"" that would take into account the product's absorbance spectrum, its uniformity of application and the amount of product applied to actually come closer to an ""in vivo on-the-beach-use"". In contrast, certain wavelengths in the visible spectrum are also used as therapeutic means. According to Dr. Pelletier (European LED Academy Society) ""photo-biomodulation, which is the process by which chromophores are absorbed by selective wavelengths leading to major signalling phenomena for biological cellular synthesis, is part of the modern management for a successful ageing."" Clinical studies have highlighted the interest of red light in stimulating melanocyte proliferation and differentiation in cultures. ""More recently, it was demonstrated that blue visible light was able to induce in people with a high phototype, a more intense and lasting hyperpigmentation than that obtained with UVAs,"" highlighted Professor Thierry Passeron (CHU Nice). Light therefore is of great interest to treat pigmentation disorders such as vitiligo, scars, stretch marks, acne. Meanwhile, Jean-Alexis Grimaud, (University Paris VI), founder and Research Director of the Matriscience Company proposes a screening method for active ingredients subjected to LED illumination. ""Our method enables to revisit under the angle of photo-biomodulation known molecules whose activity could therefore be optimized"". Many research fields that open interesting cosmetic perspectives."
The microbiota. Part 2: Specificities of the skin microbiota and progress in cosmetics,"""Although there is still a lot to discover, the skin microflora is fundamental in skin homeostasis. It participates in maintaining innate immunity and the barrier function. The bacterial ecosystem contributes to the clinical signs of some skin imbalances,"" explained Audrey Guéniche, of L'Oréal, at the workshop organized by the French Society of Antioxidants (SFA) on the human microbiota, at the beginning of last November. The epidermis generates antimicrobial lipids, peptides such as ß-defensins and cathelicidin, and receptors dedicated to the recognition of pathogens which, put together, form the skin's innate immunity. The balance of the skin microbiota and the expression of the ecological conditions of the environment (temperature, pH, hormone concentrations in lipids or proteins, UV exposure, absence of light, type of mucous membrane, water concentration, etc.) are also essential to skin maintenance [1] . Suppliers of cosmetic actives that are interested in this field will study the skin microbiota from different angles. The first way to do it is directly inspired from the benefits of probiotics on the intestinal microflora (figure 1). It consists in the topical administration of these probiotics on the skin microflora. Greentech has developed Bioltilys®, an active derived from the optimized fermentation of Lactobacillus pentosus, which improves the barrier function to maintain the beauty of the skin and help it recover its performance functions more quickly after aggressions. Lonza proposes ProSynergen™ DF, which is obtained by the fermentation of two bacterial strains (lactobacillus and ulkenia amoeboidea) grown simultaneously in a competitive environment, so that their active principles are overexpressed. It targets skins that are weakened by environmental factors by reinforcing their barrier function. Finally, Silab has developed Indufence®, which is rich in purified alisma peptides, and offers a probiotic-like effect thanks to a mechanism that is similar to that of an active probiotic, and optimizes the skin's natural immune functions without causing any inflammation. The second way to study the skin microbiota is related to antimicrobial peptides. Ashland Care Specialties has thus developed Lipigenine™ biofunctional, a flaxseed extract that increases the in vitro and ex vivo expressions of ß-defensin and cathelicidin LL-37 from 50 % to 150 %, when tested on keratinocytes, 24 hours after a 1 % active topical application. Exsymol has focused on cells and nerve endings that are involved in the expression of antimicrobial peptides, and which are particularly sensitive to ageing. Glutrapeptide® acts on the production of catestatin and chromogranin A. In addition, this active can inhibit the growth of staphylococcus aureus in culture media of nerve cells. BASF Beauty Creations proposes Betapur™, an extract from boldo leaves which regulates the skin microflora by activating the synthesis of ß-defensin. When tested in vivo, it showed a reduction in the size of pores, imperfections and specific lesions of acne prone skins. Lastly, Solabia has been present on this market for several years with Bioecolia®, a prebiotic glycan which protects hair and skin ecology sustainability. The active is obtained by a patented process of enzymatic biocatalysis. It presents a double activity, as it has a microbiological action with the selective stimulation of the beneficial saprophytic flora, to the detriment of opportunist flora, and a biological action, with the release of antimicrobial peptides by keratinocytes. It thus protects the skin's ecosystem. As more discoveries will be made, the skin's microbiota ecosystem should play an increasingly significant role in cosmetics."
The Microbiota. Part 1: A field of research with multiple perspectives,"""90 % of our body is made of bacteria, the major part of which being in the intestine"", explained Pierre Rimbaud, of Enterome, as an introduction to the meeting the SFA dedicated to the human microbiota at the beginning of last November. The adult human body counts almost 1,000 billion bacteria, about 10 times more than its own cells. These microorganisms mainly live within our digestive system, but also in our eyes, mucous membrane and skin. ""Three bacterial phyla coexist within our intestine: the Bacteroidetes, the Firmicutes and the Actinobacteria"", he added. On healthy skin, ""more than 500 bacteria species with more than 2 million genes have been detected. They can be found in the epidermis, but also down in the dermis"", specified Audrey Guéniche, of L'Oréal Recherche. Each cm2 of skin comprises more than 1 million bacteria. The profile of the species that live within the microbiota is stable in individuals aged from 3 to about 60: only composition varies quantitatively. Each person has their own microbiota, which gets defined according to birth factors, but also to ways of life and food habits. ""Americans have a number of bacterial species that is much lower to American Indians"", explained Pierre Rimbaud. However, microbial diversity in an environment is one thing, identifying its functionalities and advantages is quite another. In this respect, developing functional metagenomics offers perspectives for a large field of research. ""Only 15 % of the human microbiota genome is known so far"", specified Jean-Hugues Masgnaux, of INRA, who coordinates MetaGenoPolis, a large-scale project in collaboration with ICAN (University Hospital Institute of Cardiometabolism and Nutrition) and the Catholic University of Lyon, France. ""We aim at providing the medical, scientific and industrial community with innovative tools for analysing this genome. This equipment should make knowledge progress to show the impact of the intestinal microbiota on health and in non-infectious diseases, determine the key components in the interaction between the microflora and intestinal cells, and develop approaches to modulate microbial populations"". At Libragen, researchers have focused more on the skin microbiota and its functions, with a thesis published in collaboration with the École Centrale of Lyon, France. ""We have been exploring the functional aspect of the skin microbiota to understand which enzymatic functions enable microorganisms to adapt to the skin environment, and vice versa"", explained young researcher Alban Mathieu. Knowledge on the importance of the intestinal and skin microbiota homeostasis will be deepened thanks to these new methods. It has already been proven that numerous intestinal diseases, but not only these, depended on the quality of the microbiota. ""It has been a few years since the intestinal microbiota started being recognized as a real human body organ playing a major role in human health. Analysing the microbiota will be as common as blood analysis in the years to come"", declared Pierre Rimbaud. According to Iradj Sobhani, hospital doctor and professor at the University of Créteil, France, the microbiota definitely is a new field of research. ""My team has initiated the analysis of the role of the microbiota in colon cancer, and we have provided evidence that the phylogenetic core of affected patients' intestinal microbiota was different from that of individuals of the same age and sex with a normal colonoscopy."" The way might thus be paved for a new medicine that would be more personalized, and that would rely on the analysis of patients' microbiota. ""We, at the SFA, are convinced that given already available scientific data, the microbiota will play a major role in the medicine of the future. We are heading towards personalized, preventive and therapeutic medicine through the modulation of our microbiota. And it is in this perspective that the 2nd world conference on the Microbiota will be held in Paris next June 26-27, 2014"", concluded Marvin Edeas, President of the SFA."
"""Dermo-cosmetic techniques contribute to significantly improve skin appearance after surgery,"" Dr. Isabelle James","Premium Beauty News - You are a pediatric surgeon specializing in reconstructive surgery of the child and you took the floor at the 2013 edition of the European Dermocosmetology Days on the theme of skin healing in children, what is your view about skin? Dr Isabelle James - skin is an organ and not just a simple tissue. It is made of multiple units, which should be repaired as completely as possible if we want to obtain both an acceptable cosmetic result and most of all a satisfactory function in a growing individual. Repaired skin must follow the changes. It is a major vehicle for social integration and each problem needs to be addressed to provide well-being to the child; do they not say ""feeling good about yourself?"" As part of my work as a pediatric surgeon in the field of reconstructive surgery of the child, I deal with congenital malformations but also accidents, burn injuries, or any condition that is causing a tissue deterioration and which requires repair with the scarring consequences that it implies. Premium Beauty News - What do your activities consist in? Dr Isabelle James - One of my main activities focuses on cleft lips and palates where we follow different lines of research. The first line is prenatal diagnosis; we work in collaboration with physicians from the Collège d'Echographie Fœtale to improve sonographic signs suggesting this pathology. The second line relates to the support of families as part of therapeutic education appointments. The child and his parents are seen before the procedures by the hospital team to learn the post-operative care gestures and the diet to be less anxious on the day of hospitalization. We offer psychological counselling but also a place of exchange between professionals and parents through our association, Le Trèfle (consisting of the team treating cleft lip and palate at Ecully). In France, the proportion of cleft lips and palates is of 1 per 700 live births. The last line of research focuses on facial growth and on the optimal times for a surgical procedure. In our team, we operate as soon as the child has reached his second month with an early orthodontic treatment and secondary bone surgery and nose symmetry so that the child can enter primary school with a better facial symmetry. In the United States, some teams work in utero, which in theory is very advantageous since healing is optimal on the foetus (foetus heals by apposition of normal tissues and not by producing scar tissues) but the procedure is very delicate and with major consequences in terms of high risks of prematurity. Premium Beauty News - Do you combine surgery with dermo-cosmetic techniques in use in adults but maybe less developed in children? Dr Isabelle James - Absolutely, dermo-cosmetic techniques contribute to significantly improve the aesthetic results when surgery is no longer needed. Dermabrasion, skin-make-up, skin-pigmentation or lipo-filling are increasingly practised in children especially after facial skin grafts. The look can better define through dermo-pigmentations on the eyebrows, or even the eyelashes at the level of eyelids. In the case of hemangioma aftereffects, permanent labial make-up helps to symmetrise the vermilion and define the mucocutaneous line. Finally lipo-fillings on the face or other parts of the body enable to fill tissue depressions and improve the trophicity of the skin surface and also the cosmetics of the tissue volume. Dermo-cosmetics is also very present after any surgery, with in particular the prescription of skincare products, like massage creams, silicone gels or sunscreens. Premium Beauty News - What emerging techniques in the treatment of scars seem promising to you? Dr Isabelle James - In the treatment of scars several phases are to be considered. Firstly, prevention with the use of surgical techniques generating less scars as possible. Then, skin grafts are very interesting; they are taken from donor sites the closest as possible to the receiving site in order to optimize both the trophicity and the skin complexion. In the case of very large lesions, we can use a skin expansion technique that consists in producing tissue by placing a silicone balloon under the skin, which is gradually inflated to produce the amount of skin needed for the secondary repair. This skin can be used either as a local flap (attached to its donor site) or as a graft, moved to another site. Finally in some cases where ""total skins"" cannot be used it is possible to perform thin skin grafting combined to an artificial dermis. These techniques are used in emergency cases in reconstructive surgery following a trauma or severe burns and are not yet adapted to gestures with a purely cosmetic purpose given the more inflammatory scars than with the native skin of a child. The recent ReCell® technique, which associates dermabrasion and then the spraying of keratinocytes usually taken from a small incision performed behind the ear, is interesting. It enables to repair an already present scar, pigmentations of a former graft but also an acceleration of a scarring from burn wounds. The ultimate goal of our work is, whatever the discipline, to restore a functional and aesthetic anatomy as soon as possible through a full support of the child and his family resulting in as much ""well-being"" as possible, even if some aesthetic or functional aftereffects may persist."
Cosmetics R&D: Cosm'innov gives an update of the state of the art,"Participants presented their eagerly awaited advancements in a round table dedicated to skin models. ""We work on a simplified representation of reality, so there will always be differences"", according to Christian Pellevoisin, from Skinethic. However, developers keep working on getting as close as possible to the complexity of the human skin and always aim to meet specific needs. Petra Boukamp, from the University of Heidelberg, Germany, presented new advancements, some of which could provide 3D models that would remain stable for longer periods of time. Stem cells survival in these environments would be ensured, and so would the possibility of adding other cells than epidermal ones. Nevertheless, these models still do not reproduce the physiological phenomenon of skin desquamation. Maybe tomorrow. Whether dealing with emulsions, lipsticks or powders, the key to progress and innovation in formulation seems to be physical chemistry. At L'Oréal, Florence Levy's team spent several months on a research project which consisted in measuring the impact of lipstick components on moulding and on the quality of the deposited film. They used rheology, image analysis and Raman spectroscopy methods. Pickering emulsions have been around for quite some time, since they date back to the thirties. They are much recommended by Professor Wood, from the University of Edinburgh, UK, as a means to form bigel particles, an alternative to multiple emulsions. Other researchers are also interested in this revival, such as Otto Glatter, from the University of Graz, Austria, who presented a protocol to develop them more easily. One of the sessions focused on technologies that may be commonly used in the cosmetics industry in the near future. For instance, acoustic levitation will enable to study the behaviour of suspended blood cells with no contact, thanks to the research carried out by Louis Hennet, from Orléans University. Then it will be easier to have access to photodynamic therapy (PDT) through the optical fiber-based fabrics developed by Serge Mordon, from INSERM in Lille, France. Finally, developing cosmetics devices ""offers great market opportunities on all continents, because their efficacy goes beyond that of cosmetic products"", explains Jean-Yves Legendre, from L'Oréal. Two other fields that have become central for a few years, green chemistry and biotechnologies, were also discussed during the scientific congress. Several prizes were awarded. Claude Grison, from CNRS, and Jacques Biton, from Stratoz, a young and innovative company, received the Cosm'innov Award. Their research focuses on an industrial solution for an environmentally friendly chemical catalysis that uses the effects of phytoremediation. The biological properties of plants that hyperaccumulate metals are used to restore mining soils with toxic metals. The leaves that are concentrated in metals such as zinc, nickel and manganese are transformed to produce new chemical catalysts that serve in the production of molecules for cosmetics purposes. Dr Iva Doleckova, from Contipro Biotech, received the Best Young Researcher Award for developing a new hexapeptide targeting desmosomes, and Laboratoires Expanscience got the Best Innovation Award for the Schizandra Hydrolysate active. All in all, this was a comprehensive congress, and next edition is scheduled for 2015."
"Lack of sleep impacts skin aging, recent study shows","The fact that the lack of sleep has a bad impact on the face may seem obvious to many of us, but the research team led by Dr. Elma Baron has demonstrated it scientifically [1]. ""Our study is the first to conclusively demonstrate that inadequate sleep is correlated with reduced skin health and accelerates skin aging. Sleep deprived women show signs of premature skin aging and a decrease in their skin's ability to recover after sun exposure,"" said Dr. Baron, Director of the Skin Study Center at UH Case Medical Center and Associate Professor of Dermatology at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. The study involved 60 pre-menopausal women between the ages of 30 and 49, with half of participants falling into the poor quality sleep category. The classification was made on the basis of average duration of sleep and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, a standard questionnaire-based assessment of sleep quality. The study involved a visual skin evaluation and participation in several non-invasive skin challenge tests including UV light exposure and skin barrier disruption. Additionally, participants filled out a sleep log for one week to quantify sleep duration. The researchers found statistically significant differences between good and poor quality sleepers. Using the SCINEXA skin aging scoring system [2], poor quality sleepers showed increased signs of intrinsic skin aging including fine lines, uneven pigmentation and slackening of skin and reduced elasticity. In this system, a higher score means a more aged appearance. The average score in the good quality sleepers was 2.2 versus 4.4 in poor quality sleepers. While researchers found no significant difference between the groups in signs of extrinsic aging, which are attributed primarily to sun exposure, such as coarse wrinkles and sunburn freckles - they found that good quality sleepers recovered more efficiently from stressors to the skin. Recovery from sunburn was more sluggish in poor quality sleepers, with erythema (redness) remaining higher over 72 hours, indicating that inflammation is less efficiently resolved. A Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL) test was used at various time points to determine the ability of the skin to serve as an effective barrier against moisture loss. In measurements 72 hours after a skin barrier stressor (tape-stripping), the recovery of good quality sleepers was 30% higher than poor quality sleepers (14% vs. -6%), once again demonstrating that they repair the damage more quickly. Additionally, poor quality sleepers were significantly more likely to have a higher Body Mass Index (BMI). For example, 23% of good quality sleepers were obese compared to 44% of poor quality sleepers. Not surprisingly, self-perception of attractiveness was significantly better in good quality sleepers vs. poor quality sleepers. ""This research shows for the first time, that poor sleep quality can accelerate signs of skin aging and weaken the skin's ability to repair itself at night,"" said Dr. Daniel Yarosh, Senior Vice President, Basic Science Research, R&D, at The Estée Lauder Companies. ""These connections between sleep and skin aging, now supported with solid scientific data, will have a profound effect on how we study skin and its functions. We see these findings as yet another way we can direct our scientific research toward the real needs of our customers who want to look and feel their best."""
Cosm'ing 2013: A biotech revolution in cosmetics?,"At the beginning of the conference, Daniel Thomas, a world-renowned expert and pioneer in the field of biotechnology has set the context. According to him, industrial biotechnologies using biomass have reached a mature stage, thanks to the emergence and continuous expansion of the concept of ""biorefinery"". ""Biorefineries"" strive to replace oil-sourced raw materials by renewable resources and enhance the value of plants by investing their various compounds. From the farmed, marine or forestry biomass, a wide variety of plant-derived molecules, materials, fuels or ingredients are produced according to processes that often rely on the principles of green chemistry. ""Biorefineries are also interacting with communities where they operate. Brittany is one of the regions that have been able to capitalise on their marine environment,"" said Daniel Thomas before opposing biorefineries that interact with their close environment to those sourcing biomass from distant countries in a less sustainable way. Among natural and renewable resources, those from the oceans are often remarkable, both regarding their quantity and their diversity. ""The plankton accounts for 98% of the biosphere, there are 10 to 100 billion microorganisms per litre of ocean water,"" says Stéphane Bach, from the Biology Station of Roscoff, who's leading an important research project focused on plankton biodiversity screening and the identification of biological activities that may be of interest for the industry. Microalgae-derived polysaccharides, ulvan-derived oligosaccharides from, free fatty acids derived from marine actinomycetes: the underwater world inspires research laboratories that investigate new efficient extraction processes. ""Our team has worked on new enzymatic processes for the extraction of ulvans. The oligoulvans thus obtained were tested in vitro: production of sirtuins increased by 346%,"" said Helen Marfaing, from the Centre d'Études et de Valorisation des Algues de Pleubian (Brittany, France). Sederma also investigated acid and enzymatic hydrolysis techniques, as well as the saponification, in order to optimize free fatty acids yields derived from actinomycetes. ""The most effective method is saponification,"" concluded Jodie Symington, Research Engineer at Sederma. More generally, all plant resources are subject of extensive research. And today, the entire plant is explored, not only few parts that are more specifically targeted than the others. Researchers are also trying to increase plants' productivity. For instance, the roots - where the synthesis of secondary metabolites and hormones takes place - can be propagated through Agrobacterium rhizogenes bacteria allowing the farming of hairy roots. Wild species such as blueberry or eldelweiss can be grown in bioreactors to promote the formation of active ingredients and thus to overcome the difficulty or the prohibition of their gathering. Molecules that naturally occur only in small quantities can be imitated through biotechnology. ""We used a metabolic pathway to reproduce the production of δ-viniferin, a naturally rare resveratrol dimer with anti-aging activities,"" explains Carolina Malhaire of Solabia. There are plenty examples of such powerful techniques. The use of catalytic enzymes is one of the most common techniques. ""We use them in order to degrade plant cell walls and contribute to the release of the seeds' compounds. These are alternatives to solvent extraction,"" says Lionel Muniglia, Chief Scientific Officer and co-founder of Biolie. ""Through enzymatic processes, we can create ceramide analogues called pseudo-ceramides, which are highly valued in cosmetics,"" complete Florian Joubioux, from the University of La Rochelle. Finding new enzymes is a major issue and it is the objective of Isabelle André, from INSA Toulouse. ""We identify the amino acids that best correspond to the molecule to be produced, we start from the target molecule and look at how we can introduce diversity,"" she says. However, other techniques are also employed or coupled to enzymatic processes. For instance, Polaris, a Brittany-based company, is working on an association of molecular distillation and enzymatic trans-esterification ""With this combination of processes, we extract up to 40% gamma-linolenic acid from borage oil whereas usual yields do not exceed 20%,"" state Bennoit Lennon. Microwaves are also part of the panel of techniques used to extract and transform high added value ingredients. When it comes to measuring the environmental impact of these techniques, the answers are far from being easy. ""The question is whether biotechnology is better than chemistry or is it the contrary,"" asks Romuald Vallée, Codif International, in the introduction to the session dedicated to this conference. Some companies are developing their own measurement tools in order to know the exact impact of their inputs and outputs on sustainability. ""After a long bibliographical research, we selected three environmental indicators: water consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and e-factor [1], to which we added a home-made indicator, the eco-factor, which takes into account the wastes that are generated during the process. In the future, we intend to go further in our approach with an indicator related to biodiversity and another on the impact of cleaning waters on effluent treatment,"" exposed Stéphanie Guillotin, Codif International. As far as L'Oréal is concerned, the group uses a multi-criteria analysis regarding the sustainability of each ingredient or process. ""Thus, we are building passports for our green materials. These passports include data related to the e-factor, the percentage of renewable carbon, or eco-toxicity,"" says Michel Philippe, Green Chemistry Manager, L'Oréal."
Japanese-French seminar highlights predictability of anti-oxidative properties,"""LVMH has been cooperating for a long time with Japanese universities. Almost immediately, we focused our interest on the specificities of Japanese and Asian skins and we have already organized several scientific conferences in the region, in Japan of course, but also in China and the Philippines,"" explains Frédéric Bonté, Director of Scientific Communication at LVMH Recherche, the research and development division of LVMH (Dior, Guerlain, Givenchy, etc.) for perfumes and cosmetics. ""This seminar, which is now in its fourth edition, is the occasion of a meeting between Japanese and French scientists. Participants include academics, business representatives and members of learned societies,"" he adds. This year's seminar was dedicated to natural antioxidants (from botanical or marine origin) and their application in the cosmetics sector, but also in the pharmaceutical and food industries. Researchers from Japanese and French universities presented new natural molecules issued from rare plants or seaweeds, empowered with potentially strong antioxidant and pharmacological properties. Such active ingredients can be used in cosmetic formulas in order to fight the free radicals and oxidative processes due to UV and pollution, damaging factors involved in skin ageing and some skin diseases. Furthermore, researchers described new methods that now integrate computer predictive calculation and simulation methods from chemical formulas in order to predict their anti-radical and antioxidant powers. ""Due to urban pollution, skin and body oxidation today is of major concern. Up to now, it was very time consuming and difficult to make a confident prediction about the anti-oxidative properties of molecules. However, the research on new antioxidant molecules is growing rapidly,"" underlines LVMH Recherche."
"""Tomorrow's skin care will be based on a holistic approach,"" Dominique Sigaudo-Roussel, Institute of Biology and Chemistry of Proteins of Lyon","Premium Beauty News - The works of the team you are heading are focusing on the functionality and dynamics of skin tissue. What is about it exactly? Dominique Sigaudo-Roussel - At first, my team was mostly interested in skin micro-circulation. Using non-invasive models, we study the effect of environment, like the effects of the application of a pressure on the interactions between small nerve fibres in the skin and blood vessels especially in young, elderly and diabetic people. In 2013, following a reorganization of the unit to which the team belongs, we merged with the team of Pascal Sommer, which is focusing on elastogenesis in the extracellular matrix and on aging models. This remodelling of the team broadened the field of investigation to the elastic component. It also provided access to in-vitro techniques that will allow us to study very specific cellular interactions to the integrated model and the influence of pressure stress. We are interested in the responses given by the skin under pressure stresses, whether they are light as in a massage, or stronger, which can lead to skin lesions such as ulcers, necrotic lesions. Our current work focuses on the influence of elastic fibres in neuro-vascular interactions and on the relationship with pressure. Which genes, which signalling pathways are activated, which receptors come into play? How does the tissue regenerate? What functionalities are affected? And what are their changes over time? These studies have a particular resonance with the world of cosmetics, since a pressure is exerted during the application of a cosmetic cream on the skin, but also with the world of therapeutic pharmacology with the issue on chronic skin injuries. Premium Beauty News - What biological mechanisms have you highlighted recently? Dominique Sigaudo-Roussel - We published this year in the journal Nature Medicine [1] the finding on the role played by a stretch receptor in the transduction of a low pressure and which interacts with our mechanism. We have shown that low pressure could predict the behaviour of skin under high pressure. This relationship was observed for the past 10 years or more, and we were recently able to highlight it. Depending on the kinetics of reperfusion to the release of pressure, the tissue will become necrotic or not after 24h. The stretch receptor involved is the ASIC3 and the neuropeptide the CGRP, a molecule known for many years as being involved in inflammatory reactions, but which, depending on its tissue concentration, may induce other effects. Hence, we are revisiting the concept of the CGRP molecule. Premium Beauty News - In your speech at the last European Dermocosmetology Days on the topic of healing, you mentioned external parameters – psychological and well-being in particular – as factors influencing the response of the skin under pressure stress. Dominique Sigaudo-Roussel - Indeed, we have observed that the induction of pain can have a deleterious effect on the micro vascular response at the measured pressure on a skin area away from the pain. The nervous system reacts to pain, it sends chemical signals, triggers the synthesis of stress molecules and we can see the behaviour of the skin change in response to low pressure. If the pain receptors are blocked, we recover the micro vascular response to pressure. By extrapolating on a healthy person, we could test the quality of the skin depending on the stress state of the person, conditions of application of the product, and of self-esteem. This could be done by acting on a receiver, a cellular or molecular partner to highlight these mechanisms and modulate the influence of this psychic world. The human body responds to its environment, sometimes it adapts to it, sometimes it deregulates and this, depending on the chronicity of harmful environments but also on one's individual capabilities. To date, we take account of these observations and always incorporate a questionnaire on the mood and feeling of volunteers with regards to pain, in our clinical studies. Premium Beauty News - What is your insight on the future of skin care? Dominique Sigaudo-Roussel - The skin sends many messages, be they metabolic or psychological. Through the mechanisms that we discover our aim is not about knowing how to repair an injury faster but how best fix and prevent it from reappearing again over time. I'm in a spirit of prevention, of being able to ""avoid that"", by investing in the quality of skin. In my view, the future of skincare will lie in holistic approaches, through the mode of application, the environment and not just by treating the site but by taking into account the person as a whole. At the level of my research team, we have a great conceptual strength encompassing the functionality and dynamics of the skin with an approach ranging from epigenetics to cell, culture including the human being taken in its individuality. This is a good program ahead of us for the next 10 years."
"""Our water treatment process increases the performance of formulated products,"" Dr. Philippe Vallée","Premium Beauty News - Apparently there is hardly a single type of water but several. Philippe Vallée - Yes indeed. Water, which has a very simple chemical formula turns out to be a highly complex environment with multiple properties: water is in constant reorganization with a lifetime of its hydrogen bonds of about 10-12 seconds. Therefore, its physico-chemical properties may change. For example, when water is brought into contact with air - or with a container - there is a migration of the mineral, organic and/or gas compounds. Then, depending on their chemical affinities, these compounds may agglomerate to form colloids that will induce water reorganization at their interfaces. This interfacial water is particularly interesting for its physicochemical properties that can trigger new biological activity. Premium Beauty News - You have studied the impact of electromagnetic fields on water. What were the lessons learned ? Philippe Vallée - Actually, my PhD dissertation [1] focused on the impact of low frequency electromagnetic fields on water physicochemical properties and by extension on its biological activity. As a first step, it required developing a standardized protocol in order to control the interaction between water and the environment. From there, I was able to demonstrate that, when applied to water samples, low frequency pulsed electromagnetic fields impact the double ionic layer, at the gas/water interface of existing gas nano bubbles. Indeed, water always contains nano-sized gas bubbles that agglomerate themselves around residual impurities to form an interface on which water molecules are organized in interfacial water. The action of these electromagnetic fields, by destabilizing gas nanobubbles, causes the release of the adsorbed molecules and consequently a better hydration. Changes in physicochemical and biological properties of exposed water samples can therefore be observed. It is interesting to note that water in our body is mostly interfacial water. Premium Beauty News - What are the potential applications of your findings? Philippe Vallée - The applications of our patented water treatment are numerous and have been the subject of scientific publications [2]. We develop these applications within our company Biophys-Solutions. One of our goals is to transfer this disruptive technology to industrial partners in the biotechnology sector. We have several projects in agronomy, water treatment, and the nutraceutical and cosmetic fields. For example, our process significantly increases the solubility and dispersion of a slimming active ingredient and can double its transcutaneous diffusion measured on human skin explants. The physical process we use for formulating optimizes the solubility and dispersion of non-polar compounds without adding surfactants and thus allowing the creation of clean formulas. We increase the bio-assimilation and performance of formulated products. This eco-technology is also environmentally friendly and complies with organic standards. Premium Beauty News - However, the need to apply a low frequency electromagnetic field may be a major constraint for the industry? Philippe Vallée - Any innovation requires some adaptations but the way the industry works is consistent with our eco-technological process. Today, our laboratory facilities enable us to carry out feasibility studies and we are currently testing the industrial transfer with a partner from the nutraceutical market to produce industrial quantities. Premium Beauty News - What are the prospects? Philippe Vallée - Our R&D department continues to investigate possibilities for new applications and several projects are underway. With a partner from the cosmetics industry, we are investigating ""active water"" formulation considering that water is usually the ingredient in cosmetic formulations. In the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries, we collaborate with the INSERM on a project to create therapeutic waters. We also explore the opportunities in the fields of medical diagnostic and veterinary products. Water is an important ""vehicle"" in many fields.

New alternative method to identify allergenic substances,"According to Promega, a life sciences company, and BASF, a chemical giant and a leading supplier of ingredients for the cosmetics and personal care industries, their fully in vitro new method can reliably detect the allergenic potential of natural or chemical substances. The method is based on the use of a cell line newly developed by scientists of the RWTH Aachen University Hospital. Indeed, the researchers have modified a reporter gene [1] from Promega, so that the stress reactions are coupled to a light signal. This gene construct was then stably inserted into human skin cell lines. ""Our luciferase [2]vectors translate cellular changes into a luminescent signal. This allows stress reactions in skin cells to be easily detected with our luciferase assay systems,"" explains Dr. Katarina Bohm, Marketing Manager of Promega. Then, the new cell line has been tested at BASF and a standardized method has been developed to reliably assess the allergenic potential of a substance. According to the two companies, ""the reaction of skin cells to allergenic substances can now be demonstrated in the test tube."" Indeed, allergic skin reactions involve a variety of biochemical processes. These include the binding of a substance to one of the skin's proteins and a resulting stress reaction. Both are early and reliable indicators of an allergenic potential of the test substance. Previously, the skin sensitizing action of substances had to be determined in animal studies. As animal studies on cosmetic ingredients for the European market have been completely prohibited since March 2013, developing the method at the present time is particularly important. In particular in a context where REACH regulation simultaneously requires several thousand substances to be tested for their skin sensitizing action by 2018. ""Combining the new method with two additional alternative methods to investigate skin sensitization allows us not only to significantly reduce the number of animal studies, but also to predict a possible allergic risk more reliably than before,"" says Dr. Robert Landsiedel, Head of the short-term Toxicology unit at BASF. The alternative method was therefore submitted to the European Commission (European Center for the Validation of Alternative Methods, ECVAM) to decide whether it can be recognized as a standard method for toxicological studies in Europe."
"Nanomaterials, where do we stand?","A possible ban on nanoparticles would be tantamount to accepting to deprive ourselves of structures which, because of their small size, change the physical, chemical and biological characteristics of materials and therefore offer broad fields of application. In fact, the possible applications offered by nanomaterials exceed by far the sole domain of cosmetics [1]. ""Nano-objects can be found in many business sectors such as the food industry with cyclodextrins which are flavour enhancers, the health industry where nano vectors are widely used to carry drugs, in cosmetics, and many other areas. Nanoparticles are ubiquitous in our everyday lives,"" says Dr. Philippe Piccerelle. The properties obtained are often remarkable: improved solubility, different colour, targeted and prolonged action, magnetic properties, different biological interactions... The range of possibilities seems infinite. The study conducted in May 2012 by the firm McDermott Will & Emery even defines nanotechnology as the 5th Industrial Revolution. In this area, the United States is the country which files the most patents (54%), far ahead South Korea (8%), Japan and Germany (7%). France contributes to 4% of patent applications. The general increase in the number of applications is vertiginous since it is close to 150% between 2006 and 2011. [2] But for manufacturers, particularly those in cosmetics, there is also the question of the acceptability of these nano-particles for consumers. Won't they suffer the same fate as other substances, now more or less ostracised. Because undeniably, nanoparticles have not always had good press, especially with some environmentalists. However, strictly regulatory speaking, nothing is banned. The new European regulation for the cosmetic industry requires that nanoscale substances are subject to opinion 6 months before the placing on the market of products. No later than January 11, 2014, the Commission will provide a catalogue of nano-products used in cosmetics, and the term [nano] will have to follow the name of the ingredient concerned on the label of products containing some. According to Prof. Piccerelle, ""questions that arise, about the use of nanoparticles are those related to their physical state (are they solid or liquid?), to their biopersistence, their possible passage through the tissue barrier and to their genotoxicity."" In March 2011, the Afssaps adopted a report on the state of knowledge concerning the use of TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles in cosmetics, especially with regards to their skin penetration, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. ""No general conclusion could be given, everything depending of the routes of exposure –whether they are cutaneous or pulmonary routes, of the skin condition –whether it is injured or not,"" explains Dr. Picerrelle. ""Studies conducted by independent experts are to be done on this subject and they also need to be backed-up by information campaigns"" he adds. The conduct of such studies is essential if we want one day to get the benefits of these particles. The European Consumers' Organisation (BEUC), which groups several consumer associations from 31 European countries, is already asking for a stricter regulation. The organization wishes that are established as nanomaterials, those with at least 0.15% of nanometric particles, those unintentionally produced as well as soluble nanoparticles and nanostructures, and those with sizes under 1 nm. The BEUC also wishes for a criterion of specific surface to be taken into account."
Healing and dermocosmetology,"For Dominique Bouvier, the President of the European Centre of Dermocosmetology (CED), the theme of these 26th Days - ""Contribution of dermocosmetology to healing"" - enables to make a link between clinical dermatology and cosmetology. The study, the understanding but also the repair of injuries were at the heart of the two-day conferences. Everyone has experienced during his life a more or less traumatic event which generated a scar. ""Immediately after an injury, whether thermal, mechanical or chemical, a process enabling the healing of the skin but also of internal or external mucous membranes develops"" explains by way of introduction, Prof. Alexis Desmoulière from the Department of Physiology at the Faculty of Pharmacy of Limoges. Three successive phases take place, the purpose of which is to completely close the wound. The first phase is vascular and inflammatory, the second consists in the cell migration and proliferation and the third one in the maturation and tissue remodelling. A number of cellular mechanisms take part to this process and defects may occur leading to pathological conditions such as chronic wounds, excessive wound healing, stretch marks... Some actors play an important role: the macrophages during the inflammatory phase, myofibroblasts during cell proliferation and all physiological phenomena of apoptosis involved during maturation. The cellular microenvironment, interactions between the cell and the extracellular matrix, mechanical stress are also factors to be considered. ""Wound healing is multiparametric"" confirms Prof. Philippe Humbert from the CHU of Besançon. In addition, such factors as age, the health state, but also the person's emotional mind state will play a part in the healing process. ""The nervous system plays a role in the healing process. Skin is an extremely sensitive, highly innervated organ, a delicate balance occurs between on the one hand neurotransmitters that stimulate the healing process and on the other hand the ones that slow it down,"" explains Prof. Laurent Misery from the neuroscience laboratory of Brest. Ideal healing only being observed in humans in the foetal state. To better understand healing in order to get a better grasp of its process is also an objective of players in the field. In vitro and in vivo models coexist. They help replicate in a standardized manner each step of the process and provide some understanding. Dr. François Berthod from the LOEX centre at the University of Laval in Quebec studies with an in vitro model the effect of the sensory nervous system on healing. ""Our skin model reconstructed with human microvascular endothelial cells, also innervated with sensory mice neurons allows us to study the influence of sensory nerves, endothelial cells on the speed of wound closure independently of inflammation,"" he says. Concerning in vivo evaluations, the Dermscan laboratory has a whole range of protocols on standardized wounds to measure the contribution of cosmetics on healing. Innovative measurement tools like Raman spectroscopy, confocal microscopy or high resolution photography are used for the assessment. ""With Raman spectroscopy, we can study molecular entities, which enables us to follow the penetration of actives, the changes in the composition of the Natural moisturising factor (NMF)"" details Véranne Charbonnier from ProDERM. An overall assessment that increasingly combines a biometric and objective part to a subjective part obtained from answers to self assessment questionnaires. At a medical level, skin substitutes, tissue engineering and stem cells are widely used to deal with the most severe scars, including so-called accidental scars. For chronic wounds such as bed sores, ulcers, approaches are different. Some target the microenvironment of the extracellular matrix to restore cellular homeostasis. Denis Barritault from OTR3 proposes a treatment based on sugar chemistry, RGTA molecules which are heparan sulfate mimetics, degraded compounds in the case of injuries and involved in cellular communication. Anaïs Raynaud from the laboratory of chemistry of natural substances of Limoges demonstrates the immunostimulatory effect of honey on wound healing. These works are the result of more than 30 years of use, by Prof. Descottes from the CHU of Limoges, of thyme honey to treat ulcers. For acne type scars which are a frequently observed complication, the various possibilities offered by lasers were discussed by Dr. Michel Magis. Finally, to improve the quality of life of people whose scars are still apparent both on the body and in the mind, Agnès Arquillière, a socio-esthetician has developed a skincare protocol for people who underwent a mastectomy. As for Dr. Philippe Deshayes he focuses on corrective make-up. Cosmetics is involved in the healing phenomena which are found at stretch marks site but also on micro tears observed in aged skins. ""In the case of cosmetics, emphasises Humbert, we act on healthy skins."" In dermocosmetology, the scope is wider since it also covers cracks, cuts, splits, diaper rashes. Solutions provided by brands are increasingly sophisticated, based on biological efficacy coupled with good marketing. Suppliers of cosmetic actives in turn are closely studying the healing process to better meet their customers' needs. This is particularly the case with Silab and the active Glyco-Repair® which is now also available in an organic version. Glyco-Repair® Bio regenerates the depleted natural repair systems by impacting on the synthesis of growth factor activin A, which are tissue repair mediator, and on the synthesis of alpha-SMA, the characteristic marker of myofibroblasts. This is also the case with Codif's EPS and MEPS, exopolysaccharides produced and secreted by marine plankton, which impact the epidermal reconstruction. ""We have demonstrated that they improve the epidermal reconstruction by stimulating proteins of the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) and antimicrobial peptides,"" said Pierre-Yves Morvan, R&D Director, Codif International. Finally, a source of inspiration for cosmetology is, according to Dr Patricia Rousselle from the Institute of biology and chemistry of proteins of Lyon, ""the dermo-epidermal junction, which is a living base capable of repairing the damages of time."" We can be certain that all of these pieces of advices were heard by the audience."
"""Ultra customization of products is the emerging trend,"" Jérôme Lamartine, Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1","Premium Beauty News - You are a scientist by training, a graduate of the École Normale Supérieure of Lyon in molecular biology and genetics, you were a researcher at the CEA of Évry, what triggered your interest in skin, the epidermis, differentiation and stress? Jérôme Lamartine - Indeed I am a scientist by training and not a dermatologist. In 2005 before joining the centre of Genetics and Molecular and Cellular Physiology of the CNRS in Lyon, I took part in research projects aimed at understanding cellular mechanisms through their gene expression. I started exploring this topic through a thesis I conducted at the International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon by studying genes involved in genetic diseases of the immune system. Then I was recruited at the Généthon in Évry to work on the identification of genes responsible for rare skin diseases such as ectodermal dysplasias that result in particular in hair formation defects at both the skin and hair level. So it is through genetic diseases that I started to get involved in skin. These works were followed a few years later at the CEA of Évry by studying, through the use high-throughput analysis approaches, the effects of radiation, such as ionizing radiations on the skin. These technologies, like microarrays or high-throughput sequencing, allow approaching the cell as a whole. The cell is very complex with millions of biological objects and these methods of investigation enable to have a comprehensive view of phenomena. Currently, with my team at the CNRS in Lyon, we are focusing on genotoxic stress [1], on its impact on skin homeostasis and on the occurrence of skin diseases such as cancers. We are trying to understand how a cell enters into a differentiation program, what are the molecular mechanisms involved and how this program is disturbed as a result of genotoxic stress. Premium Beauty News - What are your latest advancements in this area? Jérôme Lamartine - Recently, we have demonstrated the role played by transcription factors particularly those that occur at a critical moment for the epidermal cell: when it stops dividing and starts to differentiate. We have shown that the same regulators act during normal differentiation and during a response to stress. For example, an important player that we discovered is the transcription factor GATA-3 [2]. This molecule not only plays a part in the formation of the hair follicle but it is also present to regulate the genes response to gamma irradiation at the epidermis level. The GATA-3 is involved in stopping cell proliferation and in its entry into differentiation. Our work aims to highlight the link between stress and differentiation through the molecular players involved in these phenomena. Aging is part of our research. Sun exposure is a stressor for the skin who will respond by accelerating its differentiation, through the modification of some genetic networks. We are trying to understand how to protect the skin from genotoxic stress, or even how to reverse the differentiation and aging process. Premium Beauty News - Your team is also involved in the study of skin cancers. Very recently, the work of one of your researchers, Miss Manale El Kharbili, were awarded the 2012 SPIM Junior Scientist Prize, can tell you us more on their content? Jérôme Lamartine - Concerning skin cancers and in particular melanoma, we use methods of global gene expression analysis to understand why a melanoma is invasive or not. The work of Manale El Kharbili [3] has evidenced that a membrane protein, the Tetraspanin 8 is highly expressed in invasive cells and totally absent in others. This molecule seems therefore to be an interesting candidate to use as a diagnostic tool on this subject or as a therapeutic target. Regarding these subjects, molecular players involved are investigated by us the same way. Premium Beauty News - The city of Lyon appears as being an active pole for dermocosmetics, with whom do you collaborate? Jérôme Lamartine - As we only do basic research, cosmetic manufacturers are not for the time being our main partners even if our subjects are of interest to them. However, we will be signing this year a collaboration agreement with a player operating in this field. We interact with research laboratories, like for example the team of Odile Damour or with colleagues fom the IBCP (Institute of Biology and Protein Chemistry).Moreover, as a teacher at the University Lyon 1 and a member of a committee which is interested in the links between the academic world and the industry, I am in contact with the European Centre of dermocosmetology (CED). Premium Beauty News - Finally, how do you see the future of the cell, you who are observing it in a global manner? Jérôme Lamartine - biology in my opinion is undergoing the same changes as physics did between the beginning of the 20th century and today. From experimental science, we are gradually shifting to a science of modelling. Yet, what is true for physics is not true for biology but I think the future stands in the gathering of knowledge with the hope of one day being able to model the cell. Another trend, which is starting to emerge, in my opinion, is the ultra customization of products and medicine. It is already possible to obtain many biological data on an individual and tomorrow for just a few hundred euros, its entire genome will be accessible. This information could be stored on individual smart cards that could be consulted to develop medical treatments or customized cosmetics. These changes can be summarized in three words: globalization of analysis, customization, modelling."
"""The theme of healing is the link between clinical dermatology and cosmetology,"" Dominique Bouvier, President of the CED","Premium Beauty News - What does this 26th edition of the European Dermocosmetology Days look like? Dominique Bouvier - Actually it looks really exiting! We again expect about 200 visitors, who we hope, will this year once again enjoy the friendliness and the high quality of communications that characterize this event and made its reputation over the past five decades. These days, which are held every two years, coincide in fact this year with the fiftieth anniversary of the European Centre dermocosmetology (Centre européen de dermocosmétologie - CED). Our partners are loyal, such as the Grand Lyon, the ADERLY, the CCI of Lyon, the University Lyon 1, and manufacturers like Gattefossé, Alpol, Sicobel, Greentech, Miyoshi, Strand Cosmetics Europe, Seppic, Expanscience, IEC, Dermscan, Vitroscreen .I hope I did not forgotten anyone. Premium Beauty News - This year's theme is ""the contribution of dermocosmetology to healing."" What was the reason for this choice? Dominique Bouvier - This year, as in previous years, the subject was chosen by our Scientific Advisory Board. We wanted to deal with the repair, restoration of the skin barrier. We hesitated for some time concerning the title before finally opting for the word ""healing"". It is a broader term but more adapted to what makes the DNA of our association, namely an equal exchange between academic research, clinical laboratories, galenic formulators and manufacturers. In other words, the term ""healing"" is one that best establishes the link between clinical dermatology and cosmetology. Recent changes in temporary rejuvenation practices, be they with the use of medical lasers, subcutaneous injections and, in general, ""light cosmetic surgery"" have led to the development of a whole series of post-intervention treatments that also include new make-up techniques. These are all the topics that will be discussed during these two days. Premium Beauty News - Precisely what will be the highlights of these two days? Dominique Bouvier - The first day will be dedicated to academic research. We will review the latest progress in the mechanisms that come into play in the healing process. The second day is dedicated to in vitro and in vivo assessment tests, skin renovator actives, with a focus on socio-aesthetic practices, particularly on interventions of beauticians in hospitals and on the compared regulation between cosmetics and medical devices. In addition to this scientific program some special events will take place that should delight participants. On February 6, the exhibition ""Le teint entre scène"" (complexion comes into play) will open its doors at the Gadagne Museums. It will be a unique opportunity for those interested, to discover the art of skin care and make-up from the 18th century to the present days. Indeed, after the exhibition ""Lèvres de Luxe"" (Luxury Lips) dedicated to lipstick in 2011, Anne Camilli and Jean-Marie Martin Hattenberg had wished to return to Lyon for a second act in a venue for which Lyon inhabitants are particularly fond of thanks to its famous Guignol Theatre in the heart of the ""Vieux Lyon"". Hence the adventure continues in 2013, with Maria-Anne Privat-Savigny, Chief Cultural Heritage Officer of the Gadagne Museums. On February 7, a gala dinner will bring together all the participants at the Palais de la Bourse, the headquarters of the Lyon CCI. On this occasion, the company ""Guichets Fermés"" will present a series of sketches - created for the occasion by the writer Jean Louis Rapini - on the relationship between the industry, academic research and public authorities. Premium Beauty News - What main projects does the CED have underway? Dominique Bouvier - Our main focus remains scientific training. Our partnership with FC3Bio, the training company of Jean-François Prost, will give birth to four sessions dedicated to cell biology: ""hypersensitivity to cosmetics"", ""skin and Immunity"", ""collagens"" and ""reconstructed skin models "". In addition, the CED will also take part in April to In-Cosmetics in Paris. In June we will participate to the day dedicated to innovation organized by Allizé-Plasturgie, the Interregional union of plastics industry that covers the entire eastern part of France, from north to south. On this occasion we will review the work of the joint working group with the plastics industry on the content/container interactions. This theme launched by the CED in early 2010 is of particular concern to us. The overall safety of our products, including container and content, is a key issue, not only because of regulatory constraints that are looming on the horizon, but also because of the thorny issues that this raises and which only collaborative work can solve. To note finally that our website www.ced-lyon.com has been completely redesigned with the aim to foster a close relationship with our members and to increase our notoriety in France and abroad."
Senescence and skin: what progress?,"Senescence is defined as a progressive loss of body functions. According to Prof. Gérald E. Pierard from the University of Liège ""skin senescence which is the global reflection of the influence of many intrinsic and extrinsic factors can be divided into seven types (chronological, actinic, genetic, endocrine, catabolic, addictive and gravitational)."" Senescent cells accumulate in the skin, but the whole body is affected. For her part, Prof. Judith Campisi of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging paid some attention to the question of knowing when and where senescence begins and what were the associated mechanisms. ""It is a very complex process, which can be partly explained by the secretion from senescent cells of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors and proteases which have been called SASP (Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype)"" she explained. Skin models consisting of fibroblasts, keratinocytes or melanocytes are also widely used to study aging. Thus the Dr. Martine French from the Laboratory of Hematology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, demonstrated that in senescent fibroblasts, the size and number of autophagy vacuoles increase in comparison to young fibroblasts. For keratinocytes, the level of autophagic activity that determines cell death and for melanocytes, their decreased activity with age leads to skin pigmentation defects and to a loss of efficiency of the tissue homeostasis. ""After 30 years of age, there is loss of 8 to 10% of the melanocyte activity per decades hence the appearance of white hair, senile lentigo and of hypomelanosis"" explains Corinne Bertolotto, from the Inserm U1065 in Nice. Finally, aging can also be observed at the mitochondria level (Dr. Carine Nizard, LVMH Recherche) or at the level of the extracellular matrix whose structure alters with age (Dr. Sylvie Brassart-Pasco, CNRS - Laboratory of Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology). In this context, what are the pathways leading to an ""optimal"" aging or even to the reversibility of the process? One of the avenues investigated by Dr. Jean-Marc Lemaître, Institute of Functional Genomics of Montpellier, is that of stem cells. ""Recently we were able to develop a screen to identify the target genes capable of influencing the entry into senescence or its avoidance using a specific combination of six reprogramming factors, we were able to reprogram senescent cells of aged donors."" In these experiments, signs of aging, such as those associated with the telomere length, the loss of mitochondria efficiency, were eventually faded out. At the skin level, it is already possible to achieve rejuvenated fibroblasts or keratinocytes. We all noticed that from one individual to another, longevity is different and depends, according to Lemaitre, ""of genetic and epigenetic factors for respectively 25% and 75%."" Lifestyle, diet, stress have an influence on molecular decline. To evaluate the aging of organisms, some address senescence from the angle of the regulation of gene expression. This is in particular the case with the Prediguard Company. ""We study the genes of young and aged skin and make correlations between the differences observed and the pathologies developed ""explains Dr. Philippe Benech founder and Head of Prediguard. Others will focus on skin constituents taken separately or as a whole. Thus, the Bioexigence Company studied the contractile properties of aged fibroblasts at the bottom of wrinkles. ""Fibroblasts inside wrinkles develop less contractile forces than fibroblasts from surrounding unwrinkled aged skin"" explains Dr. Carol Corderot-Masuyer, Manager. The Straticell Company has studied premature senescence induced by free radical stress or by UVBs. But measurements assessing the colour and consistency of the complexion are also performed by Skinexigence, demonstrating that this criterion has an influence when determining the perceived age. Because finally, isn't the main goal to look younger than one's actual age? The Chanel company has on this topic, shared a consistent study performed on 289 women aged from 20 to 70 and demonstrating that colour contrasts observed at the face level are a good marker of perceived age. Hence, couldn't simply applying make-up be enough to create an illusion of youth? This solution is not exclusive and suppliers of cosmetic actives are working on their side to offer always more efficient molecules. This year, the ends of chromosomes - the telomeres for which research work was awarded a Nobel Prize in 2009 - are the target of new substances that are found under the name of Juvinity at Sederma, Telosomyl at Silab and Telosense at Ashland ISP. For Biotechmarine and Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, progerin is the new marker that their latest actives are targeting. Induchem-Libragen has worked on a new class of receptors, the DOR (Delta Opiod Receptors) which are involved in the control of the skin differentiation process. The anti-glycation activity of the Sakura extract of Oryza Oil and the detoxifying and plumping activities of Effipulp proposed by Expanscience were also highlighted. This edition of the Jean-Paul Marty Days being completed, the French Society of Cosmetology is already preparing the next one on the theme: ""Skin and photoprotection."""
Study highlights experience-related changes in the brain of perfume creators,"It is, according to researchers from the CNRS (French National Centre for Scientific Research) and Inserm (French National Institute of Health and Medical Research) team devoted to the study of the olfactory memory [1], another example of the human brain's amazing plasticity [2]. These results, obtained through anatomical MRI performed on professional perfumers, students in perfumery and control subjects, also show that training can reverse the age-related decline in the volume of grey matter in olfactory areas, which is observed in the general population. The same team of researchers has shown in earlier studies that training enables perfumers develop the capacity to mentally imagine smells they can virtually ""feel"" in their nose while it is not physically present. Scientists have also observed that perfume experts enjoy a more efficient, rapid and specific neuronal communication in their brain's olfactory areas. Researchers thus wondered whether the intensive training of perfumers was also reflected by an increase in the volume of grey matter in the brain areas related to olfaction. To answer this question, they submitted 14 renowned expert perfumers, including Jean-Claude Ellena and Daniel André, to an MRI. The same test was conducted on 13 students from the Versailles-headquartered French school of perfumery (ISIPCA - Institut Supérieur International du Parfum, de la Cosmétique et de l'Aromatique Alimentaire), and 21 subjects with no particular expertise in perfumery. The MRIs showed that perfumers have a greater volume of grey matter in the primary olfactory cortex and the orbitofrontal region, next to the olfactory sulcus, than control volunteers. Furthermore, the volume of grey matter appears to be directly correlated with a perfumer's experience. The more trained they are, the bigger the volume of olfactory areas is. However, the researchers found the volume of these brain areas to significantly decrease with age in control subjects, and that the process is general and continuous when no training is performed. Thus indicates that the brain changes observed among perfume experts are the result of training and are not innate characteristics. ""These results remind us similar structural changes observed in other expert categories such as musicians, athletes, multilingual individuals, mathematicians, or taxi drivers. All these specialists reorganize and over-develop specific brain areas according to their expertise. The amazing brain's ability to adapt to environmental demands and to reorganize with experience seems to be limitless,"" says the CNRS in a statement."
SPIM 2012: skin from every angle,"The atmosphere at the Palais des Congrès in Vichy was conductive to exchanges and discussions favourable to brainstorming on the conference's key themes: aging, skin epithelium, disorders and rare diseases of the skin. Epigenetics was at the centre of the presentation of Dr Eli Puterman, from the University of California in San Francisco. This researcher has highlighted the relation between the impact of lifestyle factors (physical activity, food, sleep quality, social relations, the level of psychological stress) with the telomerase activity and the length of telomeres, two known markers of cellular aging. ""Psychological stress has an influence on the regulation system of the telomere/telomerase couple"" he explained. A study conducted by the team of Dr. Puterman during a year on 213 women with controlled life conditions has shown a decrease in telomere length and in the telomerase activity depending of the importance of perceived stress. According to Puterman, ""in women with a good physical and health condition, the impact of stress on the length of telomeres, in connection with past events, is negligible, while it is significant for those whose health is fragile."" For its part, Prof. Andrew Dillin, of the Howard Hughes Institute in San Diego, took an interest in another approach to aging, by focusing on studies related to the mitochondria, in particular to the humoral control of the mitochondrial form and function in order to promote the longevity of a simple cell model, the C Elegans worm. His team sought to understand why, during aging, the organism starts losing control of the proteome and how this is transmitted to the whole organism. Also from this angle, Dr. Johan Auwerx, from the Laboratory for Integrative and Systems Physiology from the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, studied how a decrease in mitochondrial functions - such as the one caused by caloric restriction - could have a positive impact on aging. Beyond aging a key focus was given to recent discoveries on the skin epithelium. For Prof. Jens Schroeder, from the Department of Dermatology at University of Kiel, the skin is considered as a microbial barrier where each skin layer contains antimicrobial peptides that protect the skin against infections. The presence of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17A, IL-1 beta, IL-22, IL-36 plays a role in the production of these peptides. The lipid layer is also important in the development of some skin diseases among which eczema. Prof. Joke Bouwstra of the Leiden University, demonstrated for his part, that the lipid organization of the stratum corneum of skins affected by eczema was different from the one of healthy skins in terms of organization of lamellar structures and ceramides composition. 'We observed 28 patients, half of them with eczema. We took into account the composition and lipid organization of the skin, of the NMF and analysed the barrier function by measuring the transepidermal water loss. Although some mutations in the gene encoding the fillaggrine seem to be involved in eczema, we were unable to establish a correlation between the fillaggrine and the lipid properties, while on the other hand, the ceramide composition and the lipid organization appeared as factors correlated with the presence of eczema,"" he explained. Dr Patricia Rousselle from the CNRS Lyon presented recent results on the role of the microenvironment in skin repair showing that the syndecan-1, a transmembrane protein capable of carrying heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, was involved in important mechanisms at the skin repair level. Finally, several researchers shared their work on rare diseases: progeria or Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome by the Dr. Annachiara de Sandre-Giovannoli, the Kindler syndrome by Dr. Joey Lai-Cheong, the CMC (chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis) by Dr. Anne Puel. For psoriasis, the study approach was done using the microRNA pathway which are short DNA segments playing an important role in gene regulation. ""More than 2000 miRNAs were identified and each of them regulates hundreds of genes; it was demonstrated recently that these short DNA segments were involved in skin homeostasis and skin problems"" exposed Andor Pivarcsi from the Unit of Dermatology and Venereology, Department of Medicine at the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, who uses the miR-203 that regulates keratinocyte differentiation or the miR-21 involved in psoriasis, as examples. ""We created SPIM to foster a spirit of open discussion, but also as a platform for young researchers,"" explains Jean-Yves Berthon CEO of Greentech. Three sessions are reserved to young researchers, a space for posters is available and they are awarded two prizes at the end of the two days. ""We retained 9 out of the 15 application files we had received. During a plenary session, the selected researchers present their work which will also published in the special edition of the SPIM III European Journal of Dermatology."" detailed Berthon. This year, Miss Manale El Kharbili was given the SPIM 2012 Junior Scientist Award for her work at the Centre for Molecular and Cellular Genetics and Physiology of Lyon on the involvement of tetraspanin 8 in the early invasion of cutaneous melanoma. The 2012 SPIM best poster was awarded to Miss Léa Moulin who identified a mechanism of epigenetic regulation specific to the aging of fibroblasts, by focusing on the Loxl1 gene repressed in aged fibroblasts. The next appointment of the Spim will take place in 2014"
What are the avenues against photo-aging?,"Sun is ambivalent: essential to health, on the one hand and a source of risks on the other hand. Its effects are beneficial for the mood through the endorphin synthesis, on health with the induction of the vitamin D synthesis, but it can also cause severe damages to the skin and eyes. In Western countries, behaviours and habits concerning sun exposure have evolved considerably in recent decades. From the 1930s, the traditional mistrust to sun gradually gave way to the desire of being tanned resulting in an increased exposure to sun then correlated with an increase in immunosuppression, in the number of skin cancers and in the acceleration of skin aging. Regarding photo-aging, the simplest markers, according to Dr. Marwin Edeas, President of the SFA, are ""free radicals and ROS (reactive oxygen species), but a decrease in the length of telomeres and in mitochondrial deterioration can also be observed."" Sun radiations, depending of their nature penetrate more or less deeply in the skin layers generating photo-products and free radicals. The measurements of the products resulting from this oxidative stress are of great interest to researchers wishing to know the reactivity of induced mechanisms and thus provide the skin with adapted antioxidants. ""We have enough mechanistic, epidemiological and pathophysiological data to confirm the existing link between oxidative stress and skin diseases,"" confirmed Dr. Olivier Sorg from the Dermato-Toxicology Service at the University of Geneva. He considers, however, that ""providing antioxidants to the skin is of no value if they are not well chosen and administered at the appropriate time and place."" A real challenge. Especially when we know that studies showing the value of the topical application of these molecules often result from in vitro tests. Very few clinical studies exist and Dr. Sorg is convinced that ""the in vitro reactivity of molecules is different in an in vivo system, the micro environment being very important."" Another difficulty arises from the non-standardization of measurement methods on oxidation products ""Methods used such as tissue assays, photometry, spectroscopic measurements... differ depending of the system used,"" explained Dr. Olivier Sorg. However, scientists generally agree on the high potential of antioxidant molecules. For Dr. Marwin Edeas the stimulation of the endogenous synthesis of antioxidants could help reach difficult targets such as mitochondria, and adjust dosage according to the individual. Indeed ""each person has its own needs in anti-oxidants, depending of their morphology and metabolism."" A clever balance must be found, especially since all free radicals must not be fought: a small fraction of them playing a part in the cellular mechanisms required for the proper functioning of the body. An ambivalent nature which is also found, according to Matthias Schafer from the Department of Biology which is part of the Institute of Cell Biology ETH Zurich, in the Nrf2 transcription factor. Depending of the conditions under which it is activated, it protects the skin from oxidative stress, but it can also disturb cellular functions in the epidermis, hair follicles and sebaceous glands. Would not all these issues on photo-aging find an answer by forgetting about aging? In any rate this is the track explored by Stéphanie Lacour, from the Bertarelli Foundation Chair in Neuroprosthetic Technology in Lausanne. With her team, she is working on a skin substitute called electronic skin whose goal is to mimic the sensory functions of the skin and to connect it with the neuronal system. To date, this research work is at the development stage of sensors with a capacity towards deformation similar to that of skin. To achieve this, technologies in microelectronics were adapted to super flexible sensors. Meanwhile, Nicolas Fortunel from the ""Stem Cells and radiation"" service of the Genopôle in Evry demonstrated the huge regeneration potential of tissue stem cells, particularly of keratinocytes through clonogenic assays, of tissue reconstruction capacity in 2D and 3D. According to Fortunel ""the cell does not need to rejuvenate but to preserve its cellular environment"" bearing in mind that ionizing radiations and UVs are great sources of genotoxic stress. To end the day, the Berkem company unveiled its new active, Origa'light, the Laboratorios Cinfa its Be Cell Energy Booster while the ICDD (Innovative Concept in Drug Development) presented a Mitosafe® method to assess the action of an antioxidant on mitochondrial functions."
"""Allergens, infectious agents, are necessary to insure our good health, it is only a question of dose,"" Jean-François Nicolas, dermatologist","Premium Beauty News - What are your areas of research? Jean-François Nicolas - Our activities and research focus not only in the pathophysiology of allergic skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, atopic contact dermatitis, but also on drug allergies. We work on understanding the cellular mechanisms involved, we develop diagnostic and prediction tools and propose new therapeutic strategies. We have cellular and animal models related to allergic contact eczema, atopic dermatitis helping us identify the molecules and cells responsible for the inflammation and those that could be treatment targets. Our teams are organized around three structures, two clinical services, part of the University Hospital of Lyon namely the Service of Allergology and Clinical Immunology headed by Frédéric Bérard and the Clinical Research Unit on diagnostics, treatments and drug testing under the responsibility of Catherine Goujon and the team from INSERM 851 [1]. Our work of course is oriented towards the medical domain but we have been working for many years with the cosmetic and dermocosmetic industry. Lyon is a recognized Pole of expertise in skin biology, and theEuropean Centre of dermocosmetology (CED) is a part of it. Premium Beauty News - What work did you undertake for the cosmetic industry? Jean-François Nicolas - Through our knowledge in immunization and in the development of contact allergies, the cosmetic industry with whom we have been working for more than twenty years, is interested in our work. Moreover, as specialists of in chemico, in silico, in vitro alternative methods, we develop in vitro tests of sensitization to contact allergens. Currently, we are studying an alternative method to animal testing, as required by the European Directive. We also just finished a blind study on the detection of low allergens. Out of 16 blind tested compounds, we managed to single out 10 of the 12 allergens present which imparts this test with an excellent sensitivity/specificity ratio. We are also involved in a European program ""Cosmetics Europe"" whose goal is to achieve the development of an in vitro alternative test on T cells (hTCPA test for Human T Cell Priming Assay). Many manufacturers also ask us to identify potential allergens in their products, fragrances, hair care, skincare. Premium Beauty News - We regularly read in the mainstream press that people are becoming increasingly allergic. What is your insight, as an expert on this subject? Jean-François Nicolas - I'm not sure whether allergies have increased or not, however there are an increasing number of sensitive people and in this group there are non-allergic sensitive subjects and allergic sensitive subjects. The person we call allergic will be immunised against the molecule, it will have developed antibodies or specific lymphocytes to the molecule and this is what is responsible for inflammation and the allergic disease. The non-allergic hypersensitive person will be sensitive to the effect of the pro inflammatory molecule leading to the inflammation. At the maximum 10 patients out of 100 will be allergic, with an extreme majority (90%) which is non-allergic with an hypersensitivity. The more and more frequent exposure to pro-inflammatory products like chemicals are predisposing factors. When the tissues' biological adaptability is overcome, inflammatory reactions occur. Each individual once a certain amount of exposure to a molecule is reached can become hypersensitive but cofactors often come into play like health conditions, stress, and food. Premium Beauty News - Fragrances are once again stigmatized in some headlines, as a source of allergens and some media do not hesitate to stress on the fact that 10% of the population is allergic to perfumes, it seems a lot? Jean-François Nicolas - Anything can be an allergen, it all depends of the dose. When we talk about 10% of the population being allergic to perfume, the conditions under which this result was found must be specified. Studies are carried out using patch testing. Molecules are dissolved in Vaseline and applied with an occlusive patch for 48 hours, hence the discovered allergies are not usage ones. Conditions are very different from a sprayed perfume on the skin in the morning and sometimes only on the clothes. Compared to conditions of use, the percentage of people allergic to hydro-alcoholic perfumes is much lower, probably 1/1000. Premium Beauty News - Are there any other solutions to counter the allergenic effect of some molecules than the eviction or a desensitizing therapeutic treatment? Jean-François Nicolas - A line of research could be to ""quench"" allergenic molecules against one another and then to see how they react. Place a molecule with a high allergenic power like hexyl cinnamic aldehyde in a assay like for example the hTCPA and see if its effect could not be inhibited in combination with other allergens. People should know that allergens and infectious agents are necessary to insure our good health; it's just a question of dose."
Emotional approaches of cosmetic efficiency,"""In 2001, we started investigating this area on behalf of the Sederma company, a manufacturer of cosmetic actives. In the past, science research mainly focused on so called 'negative' emotions such as stress, anxiety and depression and concerned the medical field. Now, it is proven that well-being is also the result of so called 'positive' emotion which can be evaluated in cosmetics, such as those triggered when inhaling a perfume or applying a cosmetic product "" explains Stéphanie Esnault, in charge of Marketing and Communication at Spincontrol [1]. Measuring emotions involves working on an multiparametric evaluation using three components: subjective, expressive and visceral. The whole purpose being to decrypt the mental content, the behavioural and postural changes and the physiological reactions inherent to an emotional impact. To have a knowledge of what is happening in a person when she opens a luxuriously wrapped product but also how she feels when she is wearing make-up, in short: to better understand the emotional state of the consumer. To achieve this, a whole series of means come into play because the purpose is not only to collect the feelings of panellists but also to measure them. ""We work with Dr. Arnaud Aubert, neuropsychologist, and use different methods both subjective and instrumental,"" points out Esnault. Thus, can be performed, measurements on pupil dilation (mydriasis), eye tracking, analysis of facial expressions as well as salivary assays. Tests of alertness and of well-being like the Bradley's well-being questionnaire are other ways of measuring and evaluating a feeling. ""We have several tools available that we adapt according to the purpose of the study."" Although scientific literature is still scarce in the cosmetic field, all the major players of this industry are taking an interest in the matter. And for example at the 2009 IFSCC Congress, a scientific publication from LVMH concerned the impact of make-up on well-being [2].Prosody (vocal frequency and intensity), measurements of the skin temperature and hormonal assays showed that make-up regulated emotions in stressful situations, particularly in anxious and introverted women lacking self-confidence. For some, it is only the demonstration of a clear evidence but the measurement of emotions will maybe one day enable to broaden the scope of cosmetic claims to other new topics."
New biological targets involved in aging,"Premium Beauty News - You defended a doctoral thesis in 2011 on skin aging, in what context did you do it? Morgan Dos Santos - I had the chance to do my doctoral thesis in an interface position between the academic and industrial sectors. Indeed, a collaboration took place between the CNRS, through the laboratory of Dr. Patricia Rousselle from the Institute of Biology and Chemistry of Proteins (CNRS/UCBL), and BASF Beauty Care Solutions. The topic was ""the role of heparan sulfate proteoglycans of the basal lamina during skin aging"" [1] . The aim was to identify new biological targets involved at the level of the dermo-epidermal junction (DEJ) in the aging process and in skin homeostasis. Under the direction of Dr. Patricia Rousselle, an internationally recognized expert in the area of dermo-epidermal junction - also called epidermal basal lamina - we studied the qualitative and quantitative changes of some partners during the aging process and the associated effects. This small area located between the epidermis and the dermis regulates a great number of fundamental processes in the skin such as differentiation, proliferation, and presents over time striking histological differences. Until now, research work had focused mainly on the study of collagen and glycoproteins present at this level. Proteoglycans are well known at the dermis level but much less at the DEJ level. All our results evidence that a significant decrease of the perlecan synthesis – the main proteoglycan of basal lamina – takes a part in the thinning and in the epidermal differentiation defects observed during aging. Premium Beauty News - What methods and approach did you use for your study? Morgan Dos Santos - We had a multi-pronged approach, namely, a tissue, cellular and molecular approach. First, the expression of proteoglycans was studied from a fundamental point of view, analysing them qualitatively and quantitatively at the tissue and cellular level and during aging. An immunohistological analysis of a cohort of normal human skin from donors ranging from 22 to 73 years of age showed a drastic diminution of perlecan at the DEJ. Biochemical studies combined to genomic analyses demonstrated that the decrease in the expression of perlecan was not caused by a degradation of the protein itself but by a decrease in the transcriptional activity of keratinocytes. We then validated our observations on different three-dimensional models of reconstructed skin mimicking some characteristics of aging. For this, we took advantage of the knowledge and expertise of Dr. Odile Damour, Head of the Laboratory of Skin Replacement in Lyon and internationally recognized in the field of tissue engineering. We were able to approach the molecular mechanisms by which these proteoglycans could influence the epidermal differentiation. Generally speaking, the constituents of aging are well identified but our understanding of the associated mechanisms is not complete. With our findings on proteoglycans, we have contributed to make some progress on this subject. Premium Beauty News - What was at stake for your industry partner? Morgan Dos Santos - Having discovered new biological targets associated to aging and having approached the mechanisms involved, it was interesting to see if some compounds were able to restore the expression of proteoglycans involved in aging processes. For this, an identification and screening of molecules by our industrial partner was performed on a simple cell model and then on a three-dimensional model. Some chemical and natural compounds proved being particularly effective. Premium Beauty News - What prospects does your work offer? Morgan Dos Santos - There will be some academic but also industrial spin-offs. In the short term, this work will lead to a publication in a scientific journal. At the industrial level, this work will be the basis for future industrial development. We have already made some in vitro evaluations on the potential of some molecules to restore the expression of these partners. This work could have some repercussions in the areas of skin repair and cosmetics. On a personal level, my wish is to continue to study skin aging. In addition, I had the chance of being in contact with experts in skin biology, namely Dr. Patricia Rousselle and Dr. Odile Damour, both references in their field and belonging to the Lyon centre of expertise in dermocosmetics with the CED being its reflection. And to be able to contribute to the development of an active ingredient in connection with the findings was a great opportunity and I am grateful for the confidence that BASF Beauty Care Solutions placed in me."
What future for the cosmetics industry after oil?,"Is this still an ethical issue? Corporate commitment to sustainable development seems increasingly guided by the reality principle and common sense. The obvious depletion of many natural resources, starting with oil, is forcing companies to reconsider their long-term strategy. ""The competitiveness and sustainability of LVMH's activities depend very directly on our ability to preserve and enhance natural resources,"" explained Sylvie Bénard, Environment Director of the LVMH Group. Like other major groups, the French luxury giant is actively seeking the technological revolutions that will bring the cosmetics industry into a new era. Oil's abundance, easy extraction and the breadth of its applications have made it an important resource, and today 400 million tons of oil are used by chemical industries and approximately three-quarters of that amount are used to make plastics. However the peak of oil production probably already occurred, and the International Energy Agency (IEA) expects that about 30% of the production of existing wells will have vanished by 2020. Of course new oil fields should be discovered, but exploitation costs will skyrocket. These questions lead the chemical industry to undergo a real revolution combining the anticipation of oil exhaustion together with the drastically reduction of greenhouse gases, and a strong regulatory pressure regarding the toxicology and ecotoxicology related to the use of raw materials. Great strides in new forms of industrial synthesis have been made through green chemistry. ""Plant or algae-based chemicals might partly replace oil as a raw material. Plant biomass can be converted in biorefineries into glucose and fatty acids, which, in the future, will be able to be used to produce monomers and polymers,"" says Frédéric Bonté, Director of Scientific Communication at LVMH Recherche. While today, biomass represents a huge renewable resources, its use for industry purposes imply to preserve its use a food source. In the 1990s early research efforts focused on bio-polymers, a sector that is now dramatically booming as it is forecasted to grow by 23,000% from 2005 to 2015. More recently, technological roadmaps were established setting out a limited list of key precursor chemicals to which scientific research should be directed. ""Today, bio-based materials are serious alternatives to mass produced or specialty chemical intermediates that are offered by the petrochemical industry,"" deems Frédérique Lafosse, CEO of Soliance. However, she warns they ""cannot be disconnected from their industrial environment, or from scientific and technical processes and techniques used to obtain them and produce them in a sound manner."" Very concretely, Carine Alfos, Innovation Director at Iterg, highlighted the development of green oleochemistry, which already represents 7% of the world market of vegetable oils (excluding saponification and biodiesel). ""In the U.S., research is being conducted on several oilseed species whose oil has a specific fatty acid profile: jojoba, Crambe abyssinica, Lesquerella, Vernonia, Cuphea, Limnanthes. In Europe, several oilseeds with a particular fatty acid profile have begun to gain recognition in the domain of green chemistry: erucic rapeseed, low linolenic rapeseed or high oleic rapeseed, linseed, oleic sunflower and, maybe in the future, stearic sunflower. The fatty acid composition of their oils offer many opportunities: biofuels, lubricants, detergents, plastics, paints, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals."" Of course, there are numerous technical difficulties, but so far these alternatives have mainly suffered from a lack of competitiveness compared to ingredients derived from petrochemicals. A financial mechanics that could be reversed in the medium term."
A comprehensive approach to detect phthalates in cosmetic products,"The European legislation prohibits eight phthalates from being used in cosmetic products (DBP, DEHP, BBP, DMEP, DNPP, Dipp, DPP, and DiBP). However, phthalates, which form an especially wide family of molecules, remain widely used in several other industry sectors, in particular for manufacturing plastic products. For example, phthalates are added to polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to make it more flexible, resilient and easy to work and can make up to 50% of the mass of this material. Since, as pointed out by the French agency, phthalates molecules are not chemically bound to plastics, they are likely to be released and can therefore contaminate cosmetics, either during the manufacturing process, or because of the contamination of certain raw materials, or as a result of a release from packaging into the formulation. To facilitate the detection of these potential contaminants, the ANSM has developed an analysis method that allows for the detecting and the measuring of twelve phthalates. The details of the method, which is based on gas chromatography and detection by mass spectrometry, have been published in the Journal of Chromatography A [1], dated August 31, 2012. Main advantage of this new method: the first time it is possible to search for twelve phthalates simultaneously, including the eight one that are prohibited by the European regulation on cosmetics, and to measure them. Depending on the type of cosmetic tested, the detection limit of the twelve phthalates using this method is comprised between 0.5 and 2.5 μg g−1. This method, which is currently used by the French agency in its laboratories, has been presented to the Technical Committee 392 of the European Standardisation Committee (CEN TC 392), as a future European standard. It also used as a base for the development of similar methods suitable for the detection of phthalates in other health products, such as some medical devices."
Trade associations contest links between diabetes and phthalates used in cosmetics,"Previous studies have shown that women have higher urinary concentrations of several phthalate metabolites compared to men, possibly due to higher use of personal care products. In order to further investigate the consequences of these concentrations, researchers from Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) have explored the possible links between these metabolites, diabetes, and diabetes-related risk factors in women [1]. They analyzed urinary concentrations of phthalates in 2,350 American women, between 20 and 80 years of age, who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2001-2008. After having adjusted their results for potential confounders, they found that women with higher levels of phthalate metabolites in their urine were more likely to have diabetes. The lead researcher of the BWH study, Dr. Tamarra James-Todd, noted herself that this exploratory research had ""a number of limitations."" In particular, as phthalates are known to be in certain types of medications and medical devices, including medical products containing polyvinyl chloride used in intravenous bags and medical tubing, the possibility of reverse causation cannot be ruled out. ""As such, it is possible that some of these associations are due to greater exposure to phthalates through increased use of certain medical devices and medications among women with diabetes."" Linda Loretz, PhD, Director, Safety and Regulatory Toxicology at the Personal Care Products Council (PCPC), the main trade association representing the cosmetics industry in the U.S. also pointed the fact that while ""diethyl phthalate, also known as DEP, is the only phthalate with significant use in cosmetics, the BWH study found no association between DEP and diabetes in any of the four models used by the study's authors."" The Cosmetic Toiletry & Perfumery Association (CTPA), the UK cosmetic trade association, also noted that ""of the particular phthalates mentioned in the study and the reports (mono-benzyl phthalate, mono-isobutyl phthalate, mono-n-butyl phthalate and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate), di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate is banned from use in cosmetic products in Europe and we are not aware that any of the others are used in cosmetic products."" The organisations representing the industry underline that while the study associated urinary levels of several phthalates with prevalent diabetes, no direct links have been found between diabetes and the use of phthalates in personal care products. As for the authors of the research, they consider that ""future prospective studies are needed to further explore these associations to determine whether phthalate exposure can alter glucose metabolism, and increase the risk of insulin resistance and diabetes."""
Human sciences and cosmetics: the challenge of Nivea research,"Premium Beauty News - Could you come back on the creation of the Observatoire Nivea? Anne Zavan - Nivea is a group that relies heavily on scientific research. In 2005, we wanted to add to our activities a reflection on human sciences as societal challenges. It was an initiative of the French teams, supported by the parent company in Hamburg. For this, we asked Gilles Boëtsch, a CNRS researcher and anthropologist to create a committee of experts to study the cultures of the body and of appearance as social issues. Gilles Boëtsch surrounded himself with Georges Vigarello a historian, Nadine Pomarède a dermatologist, David Le Breton a Professor of sociology and anthropology and Bernard Andrieu a Professor in epistemology and philosophy of the body. This is a scientific committee independent from Nivea that meets four times a year. Its members confront their views, their recent readings, their prospective analysis and anticipation of the world. In parallel, some topics are subject to publication in booklets, the ""Cahiers de l'Observatoire"" [1]. Nivea does not intervene, or only exceptionally, in the choice of the themes defined by the expert committee. Great freedom is given. Out of the sixteen booklets published in five years, only two were the choice of the brand, namely a booklet on global beauty and another one on the world of bathrooms. The first booklets focused more specifically on the observation of the skin and since 2008, the Observatoire Nivea extended its field of reflection to the question of appearance in society. Indeed, in a world where the body image is becoming increasingly instrumental in the construction of identity, appearance has becomes a real societal issue. The Observatoire Nivea also supports academic research by presenting the Observatoire Nivea/CNRS Award rewarding two researchers in human sciences. In 2011, the winners were Fabienne Laval, PhD in sports science and Jean-Baptiste Eczet, PhD in social anthropology (11 winners in total in the past 5 years). Their work focuses on the theme of ""the construction of appearance in society"". Premium Beauty News - For whom are your booklets intended, have they inspired your launches? Anne Zavan - As the books are written in French, the public is French speaking. They are journalists, opinion leaders, scientists, colleagues, always as part of a BtoB approach. The distribution of the paper version is limited since we only print 1,500 copies but they are also available as free downloads from our web site (www.observatoirenivea.com) If our launches are not directly inspired by the content of booklets, on the other hand the avenues to explore they provide may well influence a discourse, the choice of communication. It sheds some light on what is happening at the level of society and of societal actions. They are sources of inspiration, a necessary food, a way of staying well acquainted with the evolution of the society. Premium Beauty News - The latest booklet focuses on the body in 50 years time, and at the exhibition, it led to a scientific symposium themed ""2062, the future of the body"" at the Gaîté Lyrique in Paris, how do you see the future of the body? Bernard Andrieu - We notice a strong convergence where advances in science especially in terms of regenerative medicine, of communication techniques, of exoskeletons make that the body in 50 years will be much different from the one we currently know. The surface of the body will serve as a communication area where implants will be able to interfere in real-time with the environment, transmit information, stimulate functions. It will be like a total immersion of the body inside a network. We will be living in interactive environments where cosmetics will communicate with interfaces, new cosmetics will have become technological. Skin will be complemented by its screen. The body and the world will no longer be separated, other bodies will be added to our existence. In immersive arts, these aspects already exist and the artist Orlan [2] is an example of this."
"""Scientific evidence becomes unavoidable in cosmetics,"" Professor Daniel Hartmann","Premium Beauty News - Where does your interest for tissues and more specifically collagen come from? Professor Hartmann - In the '80s, the Centre Technique du Cuir [1] started in Lyon a scientific activity around collagen. Several teams were working on this subject, some on collagen extraction, others on the impact of diseases on the extracellular matrix such as liver fibrosis. At the Pasteur Institute in Lyon, I was involved in the production of immunological probes: antibodies [2] directed against extracellular matrix molecules like collagen, elastin, laminin... Our specialty was to work on proteins of human origin but also of other animal species. This working group evolved and Lyon remained a platform bringing together academic and industry researchers specialized in this area. We also are fortunate to have a global competitive cluster, Lyonbiopôle, which is a centre of excellence in infectious diseases for therapeutics and diagnostics and to which the Novotec company [3] was taking part. Today my work as a Professor at the faculty of pharmacy, has led me to work on materials and medical devices intended for health. These biomaterials can be synthetic, like ceramics, bioglasses or resorbable polymers like polylactic acid, or natural like collagen. Applications concern for example bone substitute products, surgical oriented resorbable screws or coated dressings with wound healing properties. To this end, we have developed an expertise in tissue analysis in collaboration with Novotec. Premium Beauty News - What are your specificities in this area? Pr. Hartmann - We work in partnership with Novotec for whom I am a scientific advisor. Novotec develops, manufactures and markets specific antibodies for the extracellular matrix and offers its knowledge in tissue characterization. In this context, conventional techniques of tissue analysis like histology, immunohistochemistry (using antibodies for the mapping of the tissue) and electron microscopy have recently been complemented by in situ hybridization. Hence, the collected information is more complete since on the same tissue we can have in parallel the localization of a protein of interest and the expression of its gene. Kinetic studies are also possible to study proteins produced during a process of tissue repair such as wound healing. Premium Beauty News - What are the applications of the different methods of tissue analysis in particular in the cosmetic field? Pr. Hartmann - The developed methods are mainly applied in the health sector but bridges do exist with cosmetics because the experimental approach is identical. For example, the effects of pharmaceutical molecules have been studied in skin disease like psoriasis. And the reactions in connection with the implantation of skin substitutes and biomaterials were analysed and monitored in vivo in mice, rabbits and rats. A publication is currently under validation. In the cosmetic field, work on the effect of active molecules present in a cream has been undertaken to explore tissue remodelling and understand the mechanisms involved. We try to answer the questions: Who, When and Where? I believe that in the future, scientific evidence will be increasingly indisputable in the cosmetic field, which is comparable to the health sector area. I am also a member of the European Centre Dermocosmetics (CED), with one of the goals precisely being to strengthen the scientific knowledge in cosmetics. Premium Beauty News - Are you planning to further your work in tissue analysis? Pr. Hartmann - Yes, we want to answer the question How many? That is to say, after having accessed the localization of protein expression in tissues, to be able to quantify the gene expression level. This is indeed a major axis of development for Novotec."
"""We are exploring the genes that affect aging,"" Hugo Aguilaniu, CNRS","Premium Beauty News - Your research work has recently led your team to findings on the aging of organisms. What about it? Hugo Aguilaniu [1] - With my team, we explore the genes that affect aging by increasing it or decreasing it but also those that improve its quality. For our work we use nematode worms, a model organism for us, geneticists because it is capable of self-fertilizing and reproducing very rapidly. Its life expectancy is short, 2 to 3 weeks, it has a genome which is 40% equivalent to that of humans. Our daily work consists in searching, understanding, acting on genes that have the power to regulate longevity. This is hard and tedious work because we are confronted to a lot of information. There are between 16,000 and 20,000 genes in the nematode and fifty of them were characterized as having the power to regulate longevity. These are the ones we are studying. To increase longevity, all the cells need to work better and for this we are looking for ""orchestrators""' of genes, capable of inducing the expression of many other genes. One of the keys to success is a combination of intuition and reasoning. In 2011, we published [2] results on one of the longevity genes the NHR-80. We highlighted that this over-expressed gene led to a life expectancy 2.5 times greater than that of normal nematodes. Furthermore, some old animals carrying an active version of this mutated gene appear rejuvenated. Relationships with lipid metabolism have been made since the NHR-80 gene governs a cascade of reactions leading to the modification of the expression of several genes including the fat-6, which encodes an enzyme that converts stearic acid into oleic acid. We are continuing our investigations on this subject and are trying to understand how this longevity occurs. Moreover, in 2010, we published some research work on rejuvenation in the journal Aging Cell [3]. We demonstrated that when fertilization takes place the amount of damaged proteins present in the oocyte decreases sharply. We have put that in connection with the proteasome (an enzyme complex responsible for the targeted degradation of proteins). It is a rejuvenation process that prevents the transmission to the offspring of aged components coming from sex cells. We study mainly the impact of reproduction on longevity as well as the effect of caloric restriction on aging. How do they act on longevity? which genes are involved? can they be handled without reducing the caloric intake for example, what ways can be found to mimic the benefits without having the drawbacks? Along these lines of work, we also focus on the role of epigenetic changes on aging. What is the impact of these changes in the structure of the genome? We are no longer working on genes but on how the DNA is folded into the cell. These are basic research issues but with numerous potential applications. Premium Beauty News - Can the work conducted by your team and yourself on nematode worms have a direct impact in the industry an particularly in cosmetics, which has long been looking for eternal youth? Hugo Aguilaniu - All the genes on which we are focusing in the nematode worm have direct cousins in humans. A gene is a sequence of several thousand base pairs and the ones we are studying have up to 90-99% homology with humans. The cosmetic industry, who could use some activators of longevity genes in its products, is therefore paying a close attention in our findings. We are also in touch with some private stakeholders in this field. It is fairly easy to find molecules that mimic the mutation that was found, and to undertake measurement tests on human cells like keratinocytes. As for the pharmaceutical domain, gateways are narrower, there is still a long way to go because we are very far from the drug and we do not know yet how to perform transgenesis in humans. Our findings are regarded by the pharmaceutical industries as pipelines, main lines of research. However, genes that were found in nematodes were also found in mice and Drosophila. One of the solutions would be to have a drug that would act on the quality of aging instead of longevity. This is a major focus for the years to come, knowing that in 45 years life expectancy has increased by three months each year. Besides which, the issue on aging is, beyond the scientific challenge, a huge social issue. Premium Beauty News - Other teams are working on longevity, a subject whose challenge we understand is important. Are there possible collaborations? Hugo Aguilaniu - We are following of course what is done in this area. There are in France, two or three teams like ours working on the genetics of aging, we have some contacts in the United States, England, Germany. We study a book that fills every day a little more and we all contribute to add some pages to it. We can take inspiration from the mechanisms discovered by our colleagues even if the studied organisms are very different. Some complementary activities exist between laboratories. A large quantity of articles is published every day. In our laboratory, we have an average of one publication a year and currently we have five under investigation."
Alternatives to animal testing: the European cosmetics industry increases investments,"The new funds come on top of the 50 million euros programme that the European Commission and Cosmetics Europe (formerly known as Colipa)have jointly invested in SEURAT-1 [1], a five year research initiative, which was launched to develop a consistent strategy for the replacement of in vivo repeated dose systemic toxicity testing. Speaking at the annual SEURAT-1 meeting, which was held in Lisbon last week, Cosmetics Europe Director-General, Bertil Heerink, said the research programme need to be extended in order to take full benefit of all the efforts made in previous years. ""We want the programme to maintain momentum. This industry continues to be totally committed to replacing alternative methods as soon as scientifically possible and therefore we continue to invest in research. The acknowledgement of our industry's efforts helps us to continue our research on such a large scale,"" he added. The Cosmetics Europe Alternatives to Animal Testing (AAT) extended programme will focus on: – Pre-validation of 'promising' toolbox test methods for Skin Sensitization and data integration activities – Finalising development and conduct pre-validation of the already developed 3D-model for genotoxicity, and promote regulatory acceptance in this field – Refinement of eye irritation assays to address last remaining gaps. The aim is to achieve workable solutions to replace animal testing as soon as possible, since the ban on the tests that remain accepted will enter into force in March 2013, despite the fact that it is unlikely that safe alternatives have been finalised in the meantime. ""The scientific consensus is that the development of non-animal alternative methods represents a considerable challenge. The cosmetics industry has been working hard for many years to meet this challenge as fast as possible. Nevertheless, the development, validation and acceptance of alternative methods by regulatory bodies can only be considered as a long-term effort,"" pointed out Dr Rob Taalman, Director of Research and Project Management for SEURAT-1."
Interactions between skin and formulations the main theme of the Jean-Paul Marty Days,"About 130 delegates gathered at the Pavillon Dauphine in Paris on November 30th and December 1st 2011 to better understand how formulations interacted with the skin. A theme chosen in tribute to Dr. Alec D. Bangham, the discoverer of liposomes who died in March 2010. According to Claudie Willemin, a member of the Scientific Council of the French Society of Cosmetology (SFC) and organizer of this conference, ""the great discovery of Dr. Alec D Bengham resulted in more than 41,000 publications, 6,000 patents applications and has enabled us to have a rational, scientific and thorough approach of formulation"". These two days program was punctuated by sessions led by renowned European researchers, the greatest names in cosmetics and raw material suppliers. New this year: the opportunity given to a young doctor to present the results of his thesis. Skin, an organ whose surface is the most important of the human body has many properties, one of them being to ensure the protection of the skin from its external environment. In his introduction, Dr. Marek Haftek, a Research Director at the CNRS, recalled that ""intercellular lipids imparted the stratum corneum with sealing properties and also regulated water fluids. The proper functioning of the stratum corneum barrier is essential to our survival"". To better understand skin and its surface properties is an important issue for researchers seeking to design products perfectly suited to this complex environment. For Gustavo S Luengo, from L'Oréal Research and Innovation ""the interaction of liquids with the surface of the skin is of paramount importance since many products are applied in this form"". Such techniques as atomic force microscopy, measurements of contact angles, lateral diffusion, help determine on plasties optimum wetting conditions. They depend of the nature of deposited molecules and of the chemistry of the ones present on the surface of the skin. The CERT (Centre d'Études et de Recherche sur le Tégument - Centre of Studies and Research on Integument) in Besançon, for its part, conducted an in vivo study of the effects of sebum and of various liquids (palmitic acid, squalene...) on the wettability of the skin. According to Ahmed Elkhyat a researcher at the University of Franche Comté, ""the cleansing of the skin will lead to an increased hydrophobicity of the skin, while the application a moisturizing cream will reduce it."" These surface modifications also act, as explained Dr. Cyril Pailler Mattei from the Central School of Lyon, on the tribology of the skin or its mechanical behaviour, ""measurements that enable to distinguish the different skin types and why not, one day to objectively define what a beautiful skin should be"". To have a good understanding of the medium to better treat it is the first step. The following step consists in measuring what crosses the upper layers of the epidermis even reaching in some cases the bloodstream. The in vitro percutaneous absorption is one of the research tools available to address this need. Its evolution is constant. For example, new skin models take into account the presence or absence of pilosebaceous follicles, an area conducive to penetration. In addition, as stated Dr. Marie-Alexandrine Bolzinger from the Faculty of Pharmacy of Lyon ""the development of imaging techniques allows significant advances in the non invasive monitoring of actives and ingredients and in the study of actives / lipids, proteins interactions."" To date, there is ample evidence that the sizes of molecules, the ionic charges, the hydrophilic/lipophilic nature, the solubility of the active ingredient, the sites of application and the formulations are essential factors to optimize absorption. In terms of formulations, the liposomes discovered in 1964 by Alec D. Bangham are still relevant as being efficient vectors for active ingredients. The initial technology has inspired many products and materials that were able to evolve by integrating in their conception the latest scientific advances. On the marketplace, these ""magic bullet "" are used to encapsulate perfumes, control the release of actives, protect sensitive materials, adapt to the needs of the skin... Possibilities are huge and some liposomes are formulated to withstand extreme conditions of pH, of electrolyte concentrations in solvents or in polar oils. The vectorization system is usually based on multi-layers of surfactants or of oil-in-water dispersions. But Prof. Markus Antonietti from the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces in Potsdam has opened a new field of investigation by presenting a work on double hydrophilic polymers that can store molecules in the double layer of neutralization. In a very different domain from liposomes but with a significant interest in terms of formulation, Shiseido researchers have managed to formulate a long-lasting, transfer proof and very bright lipstick with optimal hydration. The technology as it was explained by Mrs. Mouna Ghoul, a researcher for Shiseido Europe is based on the incorporation in the formula of a liquid crystal in combination with an oil with a high refractive index, very viscous and not compatible with the pigments and the liquid crystal. Upon application there is a phase separation and the formation of a glossy film on the surface of the lips. This work was granted the Award of Applied Research at the 2010 IFSCC [1] congress. In conclusion Étienne Soudan, President of the SFC announced the theme for the 2012 session ""skin and senescence"". A forever topical subject on which current science is progressing rapidly. Quite enough to attract, again, a large audience."
"Étienne Soudant, SFC, ""Meeting the challenge of the 2014 IFSCC Congress!""","Premium Beauty News - March 1951, marks the creation of the French Society of Cosmetology, March 2011, marks your nomination as a President of the SFC, March 2012, is the date when you will be stepping down, already! SFC boasts having 1500 members, and that has been going on for 60 years! Quite a good example of sustainability in time! Étienne Soudant - There are several questions to answer! I will start with the last one. The SFC was indeed created in 1951 and has continued to grow and fulfil its missions, namely to disseminate in the cosmetic field the knowledge related to Science and Technology and group members of different backgrounds such as chemists, biologists, physicists, dermatologists, toxicologists and perfumers who have as a matter of fact contributed to the development of cosmetology since the second half of the twentieth century. My time as President, for a period of one year, was planned that way from the onset. The next President will be fully operational in 2014 and for the big meeting of the IFSCC's [1] International Congress that we will have both the privilege but also the responsibility of organizing in Paris. As for the sustainability of our organization, we owe it, of course, to the dedication and volunteer work of hundreds of people who contribute to its reputation but also, of course, to all the activities that generate daily flows of contacts and of information feedback. The proof of this is for example our monthly lectures the ""Jean-Paul Marty Days"", which are held on the last Thursday of each month, the last one which just took place on the theme ""Interactions Formulation and Skin"", the Cosmetagora show which has become, in just four years time, a ideal friendly place to foster encounters between all the actors operating in cosmetology. Not to mention our training sessions, our newsletter, our directory, our website and the many prizes we award to personalities in the cosmetic field for their contribution, including the ""Prix Pierre Velon"", awarded every two years to the author of the best lecture given during the previous two years, and the Award of the SFC, who singles out, every two years, one or two key figures in our trade. Another example is the distribution to each of our members of the six annual issues of the International Journal of Cosmetic Science (IJCS) indexed in Medline dedicated to research work on the skin and cosmetics as well as the IFSCC's magazine. This continuity is certainly also due to the grouping of all the national (47 societies including the SFC) in a single International Federation the IFSCC whose idea of creation dates back to 1956 in Paris for an effective birth in 1959 along with The Belgian federation. It acts as a link between all societies and every 2 years chooses a society to organize its annual conference. Premium Beauty News - How does the SFC operate? Étienne Soudant - Like any association, the Society is managed by a Board composed of 21 members of French nationality elected for three years by secret ballot by the General Assembly, plus the outgoing president and two delegates from the Committee of Wise Men. The elected members of the Board are renewed by thirds every year. To note that to seek to become a member of the Board you must be a active member for more than two consecutive years. Each year, after the renewal of one third of members, the Board elects a President by secret ballot and also chooses among its members the Vice-Presidents, a Secretary, an Assistant Secretary, a Treasurer, an Assistant Treasurer. Within the honorary members, there are also personalities who render or have rendered exceptional services to cosmetology. Among the so called ""active"" members, we find any natural person belonging or having belonged to trades in connection with cosmetology as well as any person taking an interest in it or who can justify of its interest for it. Finally, are ""associate members"", any natural person who is or has belonged to a company in connection with cosmetics, but who carrying on business abroad provided she can prove her membership in the Society of her country of origin, if one exists."
LVMH investigates skin rejuvenation strategies,"""In many countries, in the next 50 years, about one-third of women will be over 50 years of age,"" said Frédéric Bonté, Director of Scientific Communication in its keynote speech. ""Appearance and skin vitality are and will remain a subject of primary importance in daily life and for social well being."" In such a context and considering the progress of scientific knowledge, ""the current issue is no longer to fight ageing, but to trigger rejuvenating processes"", added Dr. Max Santoul, dermatologist and scientific adviser of LVMH Recherche. In order to investigate the new strategies that can regenerate the health and youth of the skin by producing a durable effect below the skin's surface, LVMH Recherche Parfum & Cosmétiques - the common scientific arm of LVMH's main cosmetic brands (Parfums Christian Dior, Guerlain, Parfums Givenchy, and Fresh) - gathered scientists whose presentations covered a wide range of topics, including genetics, cellular and molecular biology, active ingredients, reprogramming strategies and formulation, dermatology, and even developmental meditation. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical gerontologist based in Cambridge, and Chief Science Officer of SENS Foundation, a California-based charity dedicated to combating the aging process, presented a very ambitious approach that encompasses the characterisation of all the accumulating and eventually pathogenic molecular and cellular side-effects (""damage"") of metabolism that constitute mammalian aging and the design of interventions to repair and/or obviate that damage. Concerning skin aging in particular, he noted that while the skin a rather complex tissue was affected by what occurred in the rest of the body, the specific types of molecular and cellular ""damage"" accumulating in all tissues, including the skin, are broadly similar. Whether it concerns the extracellular or intracellular level, this damage can be properly fixed through maintenance strategies including cell therapy, phagocytosis by immune stimulation, transgenic microbial hydrolases, etc. In sum, according to Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a sophisticated multi-component assault will probably be necessary if we are to achieve complete rejuvenation of aged skin - but this is no longer a utopian goal. ""With sufficient resources and determination, it can be achieved within the foreseeable future,"" he said. Focusing on the issue of stem cell and skin rejuvenation, Carlo Pincelli, Professor of Clinical Dermatology and Director of Research of the Laboratory of Cutaneous Biology at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, detailed the role of Keratinocyte Stem Cells (KSC) in the process of skin aging. He showed that while KSCs play a key role in the process of skin aging, cosmetic and medical rejuvenation strategies nevertheless have to take into account the entire environment of stem cells, and in particular the KSC niche, to be effective. For her part, Melanie Swan, a Research Fellow at DIYgenomics, a non-profit research organization she founded in March 2010 to investigate the links between genotype-phenotype, explained how genomic profiling of individuals might lead to personalised solutions, including the development of skin care products customized to individuals per genetic profiles. ""Personalized genomics is an important emerging field of science being applied to human biology and medicine. Its application in disease risk assessment, wellness profiling, drug response determination, and product response customization may only grow over time and lead to many useful innovations in translational anti-aging skin research,"" she said. While some of these biological approaches may seem quite utopian,the publication in the November 1st issue of Genes & Development, of a successful rejuvenation protocol of senescent and centenarian human cells, prove that impressive results can already be achieved under laboratory conditions. Scientist have succeeded in reprogramming the pluripotent state of old cells through the introduction of a series of specific genes, and thus demonstrated that cellular senescence is not a limit and that age-related cellular physiology is reversible. However, more practical and immediate approaches of skin rejuvenation were also presented. Dr. Leslie Baumann a dermatologist, researcher, professor and well-known author, presented the various techniques already available to dermatologists and how their combination within a multifaceted approach can lead to visible results. Dr. Laure Rittié, Research Investigator at the Department of Dermatology Photoaging and Aging Research Program, of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, explained how laser-based devices can be effective in rejuvenation strategies aiming at stimulating collagen production in photodamaged skin. Laser devices are used to generate a controlled wound healing reaction that ideally triggers minimal inflammation and maximal collagen production. While they are not yet any promises of eternal youth, major cosmetics manufacturers are closely monitoring these various scientific developments. ""By combining our knowledge with information from the fields of sociology, psychology and neurocosmetics, and validating our results in clinical studies and consumer panels worldwide, we seek to reach tailored cosmetics solutions,"" said Eric Perrier, Executive Vice-President R&D at LVMH Recherche. ""The idea that ageing is an active continuation of a genetically programmed development of organisms has been partially discredited. Ageing is now admitted to be a loss of equilibrium between the capability of an organism to maintain its repair potential and the frequency and intensity of the damage to which it is exposed,"" explained Carine Nizard, Bio-Science innovation Manager at LVMH Recherche. Carine Nizard presented three examples of skin-cell rejuvenation strategies, using innovative ingredients, developed by LVMH Recherche based on experimental work (in LVMH laboratories or within academic collaborations). These strategies were materialised into cosmetic products marketed by LVMH brands. ""These approaches enable us to have interesting in-vitro skin-cell rejuvenation experimental data and in vivo quantifiable results for skin following their cosmetic use,"" she concluded."
"X-Rite, towards colour digitization","""Colour digitization of is our new frontier"", explains Andréa Vannacci, Sales Director for Southern Europe. After having developed non-contact spectrophotometers, enabling to measure a surface colour without having to modify its structure, X-Rite has set foot on the path of colour dematerialisation. To that end, the company is developing a range of software and services facilitating the digital communication of everything related to colours, in order to avoid as much as possible sending physical samples. With obviously, some considerable reductions in terms of cost and time for manufacturers and their partners. The other current challenge at stake for the company, which now includes in its portfolio Pantone, is the measurement of colour variations caused by the changes of vision angles. ""We develop multi-angle spectrophotometers capable of retrieving their entire measurements in the form of a unique patented algorithm"", emphasised Vannacci. Beyond measurement and colour selection, the X-Rite expertise extends to many other disciplines, including creation, formulation, communication and the matching of colours. ""A number of specialties that enable users to obtain the correct colour on their first attempt."""
Will caffeine be the next trendy sunscreen ingredient?,"It was already known that drinking that morning cup of coffee might decrease the risk of occurrence of certain skin cancer. However, the mechanism by which caffeine protects the skin remained largely unknown. A new study by researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle and at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, provides further documentation on biological mechanisms involved. ""Multiple human epidemiologic studies link caffeinated (but not decaffeinated) beverage intake with significant decreases in several types of cancer, including highly prevalent UV-associated skin carcinomas,"" said the authors of the study funded by the National Institutes of Health, which was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. To further investigate this issue, scientists genetically modified and diminished the levels of a protein enzyme in the skin, known as ATR (Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related), in one group of mice. Then, they exposed the transgenic mice to UV rays. Indeed, caffeine is known as an inhibitor of several cellular processes, including the activation of ATR. The study confirmed the importance of the inhibition of the ATR protein. Indeed, genetically modified mice developed tumours more slowly than the unmodified mice and, at the end of observation, they had 69 percent fewer tumours than regular mice and developed four times fewer invasive tumours. The researchers have compared these results to another study where caffeine was applied on the skin of UV-pretreated ""high-risk"" mice. In that case, mice developed 72 percent fewer squamous cell carcinomas, a form of skin cancer. [1] While this aspect needs to be further investigated, scientists believe that based on what they have learned studying mice, caffeine applied directly to the skin might help prevent damaging ultraviolet light from causing skin cancer. The study, also found, however, that when both groups of mice were exposed to chronic ultraviolet rays for an extended period of time, tumour development occurred in both the genetically modified and regular mice. ""What this seems to indicate is that inhibiting the ATR enzyme works best at the pre-cancerous stage before UV-induced skin cancers are fully developed,"" said Allan Conney, professor of Chemical Biology and director of the Susan Lehman Cullman Laboratory for Cancer Research at the Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, co-author of the study. ""Caffeine might become a weapon in prevention because it inhibits ATR and also acts as a sunscreen and directly absorbs damaging UV light,"" he added."
The war for collagen did not take place...,"Premium Beauty News - After having chaired it for more than nine years, you are still close to the European Centre of Dermocosmetology. Among future projects, a scientific conference in Lyon that will be jointly organized with the IFSCC's World Congress to be held in Paris in 2014. Alain Huc - That's right! The work achieved by the CED in recent years has been crucial. In this context, I wish to pay a tribute to Professor Jean Cotte for creating this association and launching the European Days whose success has never wavered. Taking the chair after such a prestigious figure was for me quite a challenge. Nevertheless, we kept the European days going on with as a setting, the Cité Internationale of Lyon that can welcome a very large number of foreign participants. We have also reinforced our ties with the French Society of Cosmetology (SFC). Currently, it is Dominique Bouvier, who accepted to take over the chairmanship of the CED, providing all her dynamism to it. Christiane MONTASTIER (Société Française de... par ced-lyon Premium Beauty News – In your opinion, Lyon is the nerve centre for skin research. Alain Huc - Indeed, I believe that Lyon and its region have developed a recognized expertise in the field of connective tissue and collagen, therefore bringing a specific contribution to the development of French cosmetics. I also express the wish that each region do the same, each of them developing its own specialty, to thus prevent a sterile competition between the various French cosmetic clusters. Premium Beauty News - You were recently rewarded with the SFC prize for your work on collagen. A story that looks like a real saga? Alain Huc - This saga, as you call it, is probably familiar to the elders but ignored, at least in its details, by the younger owns. In the 1960s, the Centre Technique du Cuir decided to create a small research unit on collagen. The director, in charge at the time, Dr. Georges Vallet, believed that to be familiar with the skin, it was necessary to study its basic protein, collagen. Our team then worked with a laboratory of the University led by Daniel Herbage, with applied research being conducted by our team and the more fundamental work by the University. The findings led to the development of processes for the recovery of industrial protein waste and a better understanding of tanning techniques. At the time, the French leather industry was on a declining phase and the management of the Centre Technique du Cuir considered our work to be too theoretical. The very existence of our research team seemed threatened. It was then that luck smiled on us. On the occasion of the European Dermocosmetology Days that were taking place at that time, we met Mr. Koulbanis, Director of Applied Research at L'Oréal. He told us he had just launched a collagen cream and its sole supplier for this material was German. He then asked our team to develop a collagen solution that could be used for cosmetic purposes. We immediately understood that a promising path of diversification was opening before us. The collagen solution was developed. Production could start and the Gattefossé company was in charge of distribution. Very quickly large quantities were ordered and, because of its statutes, the Centre Technique du Cuir could no longer ensure its production. This led to the creation of a company, the Saduc, in which the directors of the Centre Technique du Cuir and some employees became shareholders. Laurent SCHUBNEL (Gattefossé) par ced-lyon Premium Beauty News - In parallel with this cosmetic activity, the pharmaceutical industry also approached you? Alain Huc - Yes, that's right! The pharmaceutical industry entrusted us with the development of collagen-based biomaterials. A hemostatic sponge was developed and distributed by the Fournier company in Dijon. As a result, our team began to work for the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries and very much less for the leather industry. It was therefore necessary to part with the Centre Technique du Cuir and create a new company. This was made possible with venture capital. This creation was not easily achieved, as the Saduc was seeing in the new company a potential competitor and as a leading industrialist from the area was seeking to take a blocking minority in the capital. After our team had turned down this offer, a number of bankers from Lyon even stopped assisting us. The daily newspaper, Les Echos, had even headlined at the time: ""Will the war for collagen take place in Lyon?"" Viviane JAILLET (Strand Cosmetics Europe) par ced-lyon Premium Beauty News - And the Parisian bankers were the ones who eventually came to the rescue! Alain Huc - Absolutely! It's thanks to Parisian bankers that the Bioetica company was created. It then developed its activities in the fields of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals and finally took the name of Coletica. The management was ensured by a directorate headed by a financier, Pierre Devictor. I headed the Research department for fifteen years, Eric Perrier then brilliantly taking over. Daniel Herbage became our scientific advisor and provided us with the support of the Institut de Biologie et de Chimie des Protéines (Institute of Biology and Protein Chemistry). We also successfully worked with the laboratory of skin substitutes from the Edouard Herriot Hospital led by Odile Damour. It was thus possible to work towards the development of a completely reconstructed skin with dermis and epidermis, which will be of great help for cosmetics tests and also allowing the reconstruction of tissues, particularly in the field of severe burns. After a few years, under shareholders pressure, the pharmaceutical activity had to be abandoned to my great regret. Fortunately, the Saduc, becoming the Symatese company, took up the torch in this area and now produces collagen-based biomaterials that bring medicine and surgery increasingly appreciated therapeutic properties. Finally, we mustn't forget the research work conducted on skin by the team of Professor Thivollet and Daniel Schmidt, at the Edouard Herriot Hospital, especially in the field of immunity. http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xhulyh_christiane-montastier-societe-francaise-de-cosmetologie_tech http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xhuksy_laurent-schubnel-gattefosse_tech http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xhukb4_viviane-jaillet-strand-cosmetics-europe_tech"
"""New research fields are going to revolutionize the approach to skin rejuvenation"", Frédéric Bonté, LVMH Recherche","Premium Beauty News - How did this idea of organising symposiums emerge? Frédéric Bonté - The initial idea was to bring scientists together in order to carry a reflection on major themes for our trades and to act as a facilitator, a creator of interactions among researchers coming from different backgrounds. Congresses are generally very specialized and our approach was to generate transversal links between different disciplines. Premium Beauty News - Precisely doesn't cosmetology suffer from a lack of scientific recognition? Frédéric Bonté - It is a profession in which there is a lot of research work carried out in biology, physical chemistry, neuroscience, sociology, but it is true that sometimes theses work lack visibility. This is also why we organize our symposiums, take part to many conferences and also publish in scientific journals. The competitiveness cluster, led by the Cosmetic Valley, is a proof of the profession's current dynamism. Premium Beauty News - Yet, communicating on private scientific research seems to be a difficult art, especially when it extends beyond the strict framework of experts? What are the objectives for LVMH? Frédéric Bonté - Science and its orientations must be consistent with the society we want. Sharing its implications, its main findings is a real duty and private research must take part to it. As a proof of this, the success of the last Science, Recherche et Société Forum organized by the magazine La Recherche and the newspaper Le Monde at the Collège de France in Paris on June 16. We partnered with a scientific photography exhibition on the topic of ""Rare species, endangered plants"", a way of showing using an artistic dimension, our commitment in the field of biodiversity. Premium Beauty News - The 11th Symposium on the theme of Skin Rejuvenation seems particularly promising, including an overview of issues related to stem cells. Can you briefly tell us what topics will be addressed? Frédéric Bonté - Combined to protection, rejuvenation techniques are based on the 3 R's theory, namely, Repair, Replace, Regenerate. We will address new research areas that will, in the next 10 years, revolutionize our approaches to these areas. Molecular genetics, elimination of degradation products of metabolism that tend to accumulate, reprogramming strategy, epigenetic rejuvenation, new tools in Bioinformatics stability or metabolic awakening will be, among others the themes that will be addressed. How far to go, what are the risks with new technologies, realistic hopes will open discussions to imagine tomorrow's products. Premium Beauty News - Why did you choose to hold this event in London? Frédéric Bonté - London is a dynamic capital and we were looking for an English-speaking context. We chose a magical place combining culture, heritage preservation and knowledge dissemination. The whole of it with a desire to place this event in a eco-design concept: ease of accommodation, accessibility, direct access by public transportation to overseas destinations... We try to alternate the venues abroad to always enrich the network of researchers that we bring together."
Shiseido discovers new ingredient to fight skin ageing,"Serpin b3 was discovered some years ago as a cause of skin damage known as ""parakeratosis"" (abnormal keratization). More recent research carried out by Shiseido also found that serpin b3 is a factor of skin ageing. ""An increase in serpin b3 not only damages the surface and stratum corneum of the skin, but also propagates and amplifies the damage to the whole epidermis, and furthermore it propagates damage to the basement membrane and dermis, and accelerates skin ageing,"" explains the cosmetics giant. According to Shiseido, an increase in serpin b3 in the epidermis obstructs the self-defense system that prompts cells to eliminate themselves when they accumulate irreparable damage. These damaged epidermal cells thus accumulate into the skin and accelerate its ageing. Furthermore, their negative effects can raise the levels of serpin b3 in their vicinity and trigger a vicious circle of damage propagation. Actually, Shiseido's research showed that an increase in serpin has negative effects on the whole skin. In order to block the negative effects of serpin b3, Shiseido tested an amino acid derivative known to be effective to control the production of the protein. According to the company, the continuous use of high concentrations of 1-piperidine propionic (1PP) acid, proved extremely effective in inhibiting the production of serpin b3 and in rejuvenating damaged skin. In the future, the 1PP acid is expected to be the based of new generations of anti-aging skin care products. Indeed, Shiseido wants to apply the results of its research to develop products that will nurture the skin and make it smooth, younger with more firmness and elasticity."
Lyons: cosmetics science is brought out of the shadows,"L'Oréal, the global cosmetics giant, has just opened in Lyons (France), a research centre unique in its field, fully dedicated to the predictive assessment of safety and efficacy of ingredients and cosmetic products. A location that owes nothing to chance! This brand new centre falls in line with the extended activities of the Episkin SNC company, one of L'Oréal's subsidiary, specialized in skin engineering. Precisely, the creation of artificial skin, tissue and cellular engineering, molecular designing are all specialties of researchers in Lyons. Long considered as the hub of excellence in dermocosmetological research in France and Europe, the Lyons region seemed to give way to other players, perhaps better organized. A situation that Dominique Bouvier, CEO and President of the European Centre of dermocosmetology (CED) in Lyons, wants to bring an end to. Created in 1962 in Lyons, the CED was at the time a very innovative organisation since one of its first objectives was to unit researchers and industrialists. Details are given to us by Pr Marie-Claude Martini, a member of the board of the CED, interviewed by Premium Beauty News: Dominique Bouvier is convinced that the CED is the ideal tool to help the excellence of local researchers and industrialists collectively stand out. ""It is obvious that Cosmetology is suffering from a lack of visibility in the Lyons region, despite the high level of its researchers and of many leading companies in the sector. It must be said that the regional industrial network is both dense and very diversified. We have undertaken a lot of work to highlight the excellence of the sector in the area by targeting both the industry and the general public."" And these efforts are bearing fruit. In February, the CED organized its 25th European Days on the theme of the use of stem cells in dermocosmetology and it was a success considering the number of delegates and the interest generated by the work presented. According to Frédéric Bonté, in charge of LVMH's Scientific Communications for Perfume and Cosmetic Research, these European Days are a unique opportunity for researchers to share and exchange: According to Alain Denis, Global R&D Director of BASF Beauty Care Solutions, links with basic research organizations are essential for innovation, especially in the domain of actives: In conjunction with this event, the Museum of Textiles and of Decorative Arts of Lyons was launching the exhibition 'Luxury Lips', relating for the general public, the saga of lipstick. ""An opportunity to enhance the work of formulation, packaging or design manufacturers who usually stay in the shadows of their products,"" explained Bouvier. There too, success was the one expected since the duration of the exhibition had to be extended an extra month. A series of initiatives that the CED intends to renew with in focus, the organisation of a satellite-relayed scientific day of the IFSCC's World Congress (International Federation of Societies of Cosmetic Chemists) in 2014. Quite enough to impart Lyons with a taste of capital of cosmetic research!"
Stem cells: what prospects for cosmetology?,"More than 210 people attended the event, held on 3 and 4 February 2011 in Lyon, under the auspices of the Centre européen de dermocosmétologie (European centre of dermocosmetology) and its president Mrs Dominique Bouvier. The interest in stem cells (or undifferentiated cells) results in their two main characteristics: they can give specialized cells through cell differentiation and they can renew themselves a very large number of times. Stem cells are present at the different stages in the development of human beings, thus there are: embryonic stem cells, foetal stem cells and adult stem cells. These cells do not share the same properties. The very first embryonic stem cells (from the zygote to the eight-cell blastomere, at the fourth day of embryonic development) can give all cell types, and thus an entire organism: they are called totipotent. Then appear pluripotent stem cells, capable of giving rise to all cell types, embryonic annexes excepted. In later stages, there are: – Multipotent stem cells, which may give different cell types, but specific to a given cell lineage. – Unipotent stem cells, that can give only one kind of cell. They can, however, like any stem cell, insure self-renewal, it is therefore important to distinguish them from precursors. Skin is a considerable reservoir of adult stem cells offering new therapeutic perspectives while giving rise to fewer ethical issues compared the use of stem cells of embryonic origin. Some of them may be used for therapeutic skin applications, such as the treatment of severe burns. But there are a number of other promising prospects because scientists are now capable of reprogramming them to make so-called multipotent embryonic-type stem cells, which can then reproduce all types of cells. Thus, very recently researchers were able to obtain blood cells and cardiac cells from adult skin stem cells. The study of skin stem cells is still in its infancy, there are at least seven different reservoirs (""niches"") currently identified in human beings at the level of the epidermis, hair follicles, sweat and sebaceous glands, dermis and adipose tissue. Each one has its specificities and its possible uses. Although they are the purpose of much research, stem cells still retain their share of mystery because their identification remains complex due to the lack of specific markers and also to the fact their characteristics will change when they are cultured in vitro which further complicates the study. Some questions on their biology are also widely debated. In particular, concerning the issue related to their ageing, which seems to be more the consequences of changes in the micro-environment affecting their regenerative capacities, than a reduction in their number. The question remains open. Skin applications of stem cells cover very large areas ranging from basic research to regenerative and aesthetic medicine and finally cosmetology. Researchers are now able to reconstruct in vitro, tissue with melanocytes and hair follicles to deepen the fundamental knowledge on stem cells (evaluating the impact of UV radiation, understanding the phenomena of hair loss or hair bleaching...) or to study some skin diseases (bullous diseases, vitiligo ...). In the medical field, these reconstructed skins can be used for skin grafts for burn victims, for some pigmentation diseases or for the transplantation of hair follicles in the domain of baldness. In the field of plastic and aesthetic surgery, lipofilling techniques, used for over twenty years, consists in taking from a patient some adipose tissue, with a very rich content in stem cells and to reinject it after centrifugation to help restore contour and volume defects or to facilitate the healing of chronic wounds. Finally, the cosmetic field is not to be outdone. Skin tissues developed from stem cells allow carrying out pharmaco-toxicology studies. The European project ScreenTox, which has just begun, is also an example of that. It aims to assess the toxicology of drugs, chemicals and cosmetic ingredients through the use of stem cells. Reconstructed models help achieve a complete skin or some specific tissues such as adipose tissue, which are increasingly used by the industry and the suppliers of cosmetic ingredients to study the effectiveness of active cosmetic ingredients. In the field of ageing, the stimulation of stem cells or on the contrary, the limitation of their growth to avoid their shortage were discussed repeatedly during the conference. Unknown factors in this area have been widely highlighted and representatives from the R & D departments of major cosmetic brands have presented their research efforts in this area while putting forward their extreme caution as to immediate applications. The answer of specialist researchers is quite clear: current knowledge on stem cells does not indicate it would be wise to try to change their behaviour. It is nevertheless admitted that a better understanding of how to act on the composition of the niche, its functions and its interactions with stem cells, will enable to act without affecting stem cells themselves. The debate over stem cells in the field of anti-aging cosmetics is not closed either. The second part of the European Dermocosmetology Days was devoted to the presentation of various cosmetic active ingredients, most of them of plant origin. Some of them are called ""plant stem cells"" and provide the necessary elements to protect skin stem cells. Others allow, thanks to the biotechnology-techniques from which they were produced to protect biodiversity, avoid the problem of pollutants or overcome sourcing problems due to seasonality. And finally, some suppliers have highlighted the interest of skin stem cells to assess the efficacy of their actives. In short, a very broad area of possibilities, but nonetheless a domain where research efforts to be undertaken and knowledge to be acquired are still considerable."
"""Skin is increasingly more assaulted"" Dr. Marek Haftek, CNRS","Premium Beauty News - You have been working for many years on the skin barrier and its functions. Dr. Marek Haftek - The Laboratory ""Normal and pathological functions of the skin barrier"" integrated in the University Lyon 1, which I head, is trying to understand how work biological mechanisms that allow the skin to achieve its role as a body protector. It is a vital function, since the skin, especially its outermost part, the stratum corneum, or horny layer, is both a protection against the risk of massive loss of body fluids, and a protection against external aggressions. The stratum corneum's malfunctions are very interesting to study from a scientific point of view. They can of course be the result of diseases, but they can also be at the origin or self-sustain pathological processes. Our research also focuses on analyzing the molecular components and their regulation, particularly in atopic dermatitis and aging. We also work on the protection against physical and chemical stresses and on the phenomena of transcutaneous penetration. The objective being to develop therapeutic and industrial applications oriented on the barrier function of human epidermis. Premium Beauty News - What is the importance of this barrier for cosmetics? Dr. Marek Haftek - This barrier is the skin's surface, it is actually what can be seen. The malfunctioning of biological functions that produce it may have unattractive consequences which are at the heart of cosmetic issues. Understanding the biology of this barrier is obviously useful to prevent damage suffered by skin with age or as a result of external stresses. The skin surface forming the barrier is composed of ""dead"" cells as a result of biological processes pre-programmed within underlying living cells. A number of dysfunctions are likely to affect these complex processes and induce disturbances and inconveniences ranging from simple dry skin, with the discomfort associated to it, to severe allergies to different substances, including skin redness or unsightly flaking. Cosmetic products will try to correct the consequences of these dysfunctions, by providing for example lipids that will integrate the stratum corneum, reinforcing its hydration, to make it more supple, thus improving its appearance while providing extra comfort. We can go even further. This is the reason why we are also studying the penetration process of cosmetic or pharmaceutical products, to target the passage of some molecules ensuring the skin's appropriate functioning. Premium Beauty News - Do aggressions against this barrier have a tendency to increase? Dr. Marek Haftek - Unquestionably. In fact, the skin is more and more assaulted. Firstly, people in developed countries live in an increasingly complex universe from a chemical point of view, with a proliferation of allergens and aggressive substances in their environment. Other factors, such as dryer air coming from heaters or air conditioners affect the skin condition. In developed countries, atopic dermatitis is growing exponentially. Premium Beauty News - And the exposure to UVs? Dr. Marek Haftek - It also influences the skin condition, but in a different way. Indeed, one of the important functions of the stratum corneum is to protect underlying tissues from ultraviolet radiation. The horny layer absorbs about 70% of UV-Bs, but the rest passes through and can induce significant damage. Not to mention UV-As and infra-red radiations that penetrate more deeply and act on the dermis. Our laboratory, which comprises mainly researchers specialised in skin biology and galenical pharmacists, is taking a very great interest in how the skin barrier manages to cope with all these stresses, and how it is possible to strengthen natural defences. Premium Beauty News - What are the current issues of research on the barrier function of skin? Dr. Marek Haftek - The main scientific challenge is to better understand interactions between the different elements that contribute to the production and function of the skin barrier. We have a pretty good picture of the role played by each element, but it is still unclear to us on how the modification of one of these elements interacts on the others to achieve the appropriate final function. Such an important mechanism for the survival of the human being can not just depend on a single element! The impairment of a link may well modulate the function but shouldn't abolish it. For this reason, we learn a lot from genetic diseases that affect a particular function. The increasing development of atopic dermatitis is also insightful. It was recently discovered how the mutation of a gene (that of filaggrin) can induce dysfunctions of the skin barrier and make people very vulnerable vis-à-vis substances in their environment. Premium Beauty News - Specifically, what are the topics of current research in your lab? Dr. Marek Haftek - Concerning the topics of research we can name: – The differentiation and epidermal extracellular matrix (Marek Haftek, Sylvie Callejon), – The barrier functions in normal human epidermis and in atopic dermatitis (Marek Haftek, Sylvie Callejon, Jacques Portoukalian), – The roles of dendritic cells in defence, allergy and tolerance (Josette Péguet, Claude Vincent, Aurore Rozières, Florence Persat, Evelyne Colomb), – The transcutaneous penetration and the galenic formulation of nanoparticles for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes(Françoise Falson, Fabrice Pirot, Valérie Bertholle, Karine Padois), – The clinical and pathological aspects of composite grafts and of side effects of immunosuppression (Sylvie Euvrard, Jean Kanitakis), – Melanoma (Luc Thomas). In addition, we organize every year in Lyon, a course in French language of skin biology (CoBiP) [1]. Like the European Dermocosmetology Days, who will soon take place in Lyon [2], this course contributes to the promotion of excellence in the Rhone-Alpes region in dermocosmetology. Indeed, the Lyon region features unique assets with the presence of several major laboratories specialized in skin and with advanced research centres on the biology and chemistry of proteins. Basic and applied public research is particularly developed: skin substitutes and skin substrates, collagen-based biomaterials, formulation (topical forms of products), active ingredients, skin diseases - cancers and allergies, skin/graft/immune suppression relations, etc. The region has an exceptional expertise in the field of dermatological research and cosmetic products, it is important to make the promotion of it!"
Nano-sized titanium dioxide may cause pulmonary inflammation,"According to a research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) by a Swiss-French team of scientists, ""inhalation of nano-TiO2 provokes lung inflammation"". The authors of the study add that ""the current use of nano-TiO2 may present a health hazard due to its capacity to induce IL-1R signaling, a situation reminiscent of inflammation provoked by asbestos exposure."" Actually, the researchers from the University of Lausanne's Department of Biochemistry in Switzerland, and the University of Orléans' Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Embryology, in France, investigated the inflammatory capacity of TiO2 nanoparticles by testing them on human cells and in lab experiments using mice. They found that nano-TiO2 can cause pulmonary inflammation through biological mechanisms very similar to asbestos and silicone, thus releasing molecules capable of attacking DNA, proteins and cell membranes. Jürg Tschopp, the lead researcher and professor of biochemistry at the University of Lausanne, told Swiss media that asbestos and nano-TiO2 particles act in a very similar way and can get accumulated in lungs. According to Professor Tschopp more caution should be required in order to limit the absorption of these particles at work and in daily life. Titanium dioxide is widely employed as a pigment to provide whiteness and opacity to products such as paints, coatings, plastics, papers, inks, foods, medicines (i.e. pills and tablets) as well as most toothpastes. Nanoparticles of titanium dioxide are increasingly used in various fields, including paints, biomedicine, electronics and sunscreens. Scientific literature reports increased incidence of respiratory diseases in people exposed to titanium dioxide and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified titanium dioxide dust as possibly carcinogenic to humans (IARC Group 2B) when inhaled. Titanium dioxide in its nano form gets more easily absorbed into the skin and this has regularly raised health concerns. The new Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 November 2009 on cosmetic products, which will come into full force on July 13, 2013, provides that cosmetic products containing nanoparticules will have to be notified to the Commission six months prior being placed on the market and that nanomaterials in the formula will have to be mentioned in the list of ingredients with the concerned substance followed by the word ""nano"" in brackets (e.g.: Titanium dioxyde [nano])."
Sunscreen can help prevent melanoma,"The message that sunscreen can prevent sunburns, early skin ageing and most skin cancers, including melanoma, the deadliest form, is now backed by a large randomised trial conducted in Australia. [1] Scientists at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research (QIMR) have randomly selected 1,621 residents from the city of Nambour, to participate in a trial which ran from 1992 to 1996. Half the participants applied sunscreen every day and the other half continued to apply sunscreen as they would normally. After 15 years, the number of people who developed melanomas from the discretionary sunscreen group was twice that of the group who had applied daily sunscreen in the trial. ""This is the first time that a randomised trial has been conducted that can evaluate if using sunscreen prevents melanoma,"" explained lead researcher and Head of QIMR's Cancer and Population Studies Laboratory Professor Adèle Green. ""By randomly assigning people to the two groups we overcame the bias present in other studies. Often the very people who are predisposed to developing melanomas, eg people with fair skin, are the people predisposed to applying sunscreen and therefore it is impossible to determine if sunscreen is independently able to prevent melanomas."" The effectiveness of sunscreen's protection against melanoma has been highly controversial and Professor Adèle Green deems that QIMR's now provide some assurance to medical professionals, public health authorities and the general public, that the regular application of sunscreen is likely to be beneficial with regard to melanoma protection. ""While sunscreen use is an important part of skin cancer prevention, they of course are not the whole solution: other sun protection measures should be continued too,"" she added Australia is the country with the highest rates of melanoma and skin cancer in the world, and residents of Queensland have rates even higher than other Australians. In an effort to refine their understanding of the factors that underlie skin cancer risk, researchers at the QIMR recently embarked on the largest skin cancer research study ever conducted in Australia. More than 200,000 men and women will be invited to participate. ""Around 451,000 people will be newly diagnosed with non-melanoma skin cancers in Australia in 2010, and more than 2,000 will develop melanoma,"" said Associate Professor David Whiteman from QIMR's Cancer Control Group."
Study suggests Triclosan exposure may increase allergies,"A study by the University of Michigan (U-M) School of Public Health [1] suggests that young people exposed to triclosan - a substance used in some soaps, cleansers, toothpastes and other personal care products - may be subject to increased allergy risks. Researchers at the U-M used data from the 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [2] to compare the amounts of triclosan found in urine with diagnosis of allergies or hay fever in a sample of U.S. adults and children over age 6. They found that people age 18 and under with higher levels of triclosan were more likely to report diagnosis of allergies and hay fever. The authors said the study findings may support the ""hygiene hypothesis,"" which argues that living in excessively clean and hygienic environments may be detrimental to the development of the human immune system that require some level of exposure to micro-organisms. Previous animal studies indicate that triclosan, known as an endocrine-disrupting compound (EDC), may affect the immune system, but this is the first known study to look at exposure to triclosan as it relates to human immune function, said Allison Aiello, associate professor at the U-M School of Public Health. However, U-M researchers added they need additional studies to check if a causal relationship can be established between the use of triclosan and the higher frequency of hay fever and allergy diagnoses. ""One limitation of the study is that it measured disease and exposure simultaneously and thus shows only part of the picture,"" Aiello said. ""It is possible, for example, that individuals who have an allergy are more hygienic because of their condition, and that the relationship we observed is, therefore, not causal or is an example of reverse causation."" The lack of any causal link in the study form most of the critics expressed by the American Cleaning Institute (ACI – formerly The Soap and Detergent Association), which represents the US cleaning products industry. ""This is speculation at its worst. The researchers do not provide data to show a problematic cause-and-effect from usage of antibacterial soap containing triclosan,"" said Richard Sedlak, ACI's Senior Vice President of Technical & International Affairs. ""ACI doesn't want this mythmaking and fear-mongering to discourage individuals from engaging in important cleaning and disinfecting practices. Smart, targeted hygiene is essential to preventing the spread of germs and illness that can truly make us sick or even kill us,"" he added."
Study links presence of UV filters in human milk with cosmetics use,"Researchers say it is the first time that a link can be made between exposure to cosmetics and the level of specific contaminants in the body. A recent study, which is part of Swiss national research programme on endocrine disruptors [1], shows that the presence of cosmetic UV filters in the human body is widespread and is correlated to product use. Three cohorts of human milk were sampled over three years (2004, 2005 and 2006) at maternity in Basel. The participants filled out a detailed questionnaire with a special focus on the use of cosmetic products. Chemicals out of a large range of products, including persistent organic pollutants (POPs) but not limited to them, were analyzed in the same human milk sample. The list comprised cosmetic UV filters, synthetic musk fragrances, pesticides, phthalates, parabens, flame retardants (polybrominated diphenylethers), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs); in total 89 analyses per milk sample. The chemical analytical data of milk samples of individual mothers were then compared with the information obtained through the questionnaire. ""Human milk was chosen because it provides direct information on exposure of the suckling infant and indirect information on exposure of the mother during pregnancy,"" explain Margret Schlumpf and Walter Lichtensteiger, who lead the research. The study found widespread presence of UV filters in the human body as they were detected in 85% of human milk samples, at concentrations comparable to PCBs. Synthetic musk fragrances were also present in the milk samples. While the concentration in milk samples of classical contaminants such as PCBs, DDT and metabolites of DDT as well as some other persistent organochlor pesticides was generally similar, variations of UV filter concentrations were significant between samples. Actually, the presence of UV filters in human milk was correlated with the use of cosmetic products containing these UV filters. ""It seems plausible that exposure to other cosmetic constituents such as synthetic fragrances is also linked to the use of the corresponding products. However, this could not be investigated because musk fragrances are not declared,"" comment the authors."
LVMH explores the multiple interfaces of cosmetics,"""Interfaces."" The unifying thread of the 10th Scientific Symposium organised by LVMH Recherche Parfums & Cosmétiques opened the door to a multitude of approaches, whether anthropological, biological, chemical or even historical. At the end, cosmetology emerged as a comprehensive science. Indeed, the notion of interface can be applied to many areas, starting, of course, by the skin itself. ""Skin is the final destination of the cosmetic products. It is our interface with the world: an interface of colour, a visible protective interface and a support of our contact with others. The everyday life of skin is governed by biological and physicochemical interfaces, exchanges with light or other sources of stress,"" explains Frédéric Bonté, Director of Scientific Communication at LVMH Recherche. Professor Nina G. Jablonski, Head of Department of Anthropology at the Pennsylvania State University, explained that human skin is unique among mammals because its lack of functional body hair, its high density of sweat glands, its range of natural colours, and its ability to be deliberated decorated for social purposes. ""Humans are highly visual animals, and it is likely that we have been decorating our naked skin for nearly the entire history of our species. Reconstruction of the details of this history is difficult, but archaeological evidence indicates that humans have probably been decorating their skin with mineral pigments for at least 80,000 years."" Skin therefore appears as a social communication tool, including the colour that we intend it to get through tanning or, on the contrary, through bleaching agents. For his part, Desmond Tobin, Professor of Cell Biology and Director of the Centre for Skin Sciences (CSS) at the University of Bradford, says human skin is ""strategically located at the interface of the internal and noxious external environments."" It ""plays a significant role in sensing and responding to light of all types,"" he adds. Generally speaking, human beings are looking for sun light and are avoiding it too: the need it, but it can become dangerous. As per the latter, the effects of UV radiations have been extensively documented, however, according to Pr. Tobin, other types of light also deserve more scientific attention. For instance, approximately 33% of the sunlight impacting on human skin is represented by infra red light and its impact on skin ageing has been demonstrated recently. The incidence of visible light is also of current research interest. At this level, recent findings are quite surprising, as photosentive proteins, rhodopsin and opsin, once considered as specific of rod cells of the eye's retina, have been detected in human epidermis. According to Desmond Tobin, skin appears as a giant photoprotector organ, as well as a giant photoreceptor, which is sensitive to all kinds of lights that may have noticeable negative or positive health effects. If the understanding of the skin's structure and biology made huge progress over the latest years, it is also because of the progress in microscopy techniques. Emmanuelle Noblesse, Responsible of the Life Imaging Platform, Biology and Cutaneaous Obhjectivation Department at LVMH Recherche, explained the role of imaging in the demonstration of the various biological mechanisms that occur in cutaneous tissues. Beyond the role of skin, LVMH Recherche intended to show that the concept of interfaces was also applicable to cosmetic products, being either skin care, make-up or fragrances, both as complex molecular systems and as consumer goods that need to make sense in the mind of consumers. Dr. Johann W. Wiechers hence presented a method for characterising emulsion structures, in order to better understand the surfactants' behaviours at the interfaces between water and oil phases. Recently, this theory was transformed into a computer programme that can be used by formulators, with the aim of better understanding the behaviour of a surfactant system and thus decrease the number of operations required to get a desired emulsion. Then, Sylvie Hénon, Professor of Physic at the University Paris Diderot, explained that the products used in cosmetology are mostly derived from divided media (suspensions, emulsions, and foams are composed of solid particles, liquid droplets or gas bubbles dispersed in a liquid) and their properties are largely dictated by the extent of the interface between the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium. However creation of an interface requires free energy, the cost to which is known as surface tension. Surfactant molecules reduce the surface tension and are one of the strategies that allow to stabilize suspensions and emulsions. Finally, in a very different field, Germain Gazano, Marketing and Consumer Intelligence Director at LVMH Recherche, described the various methods that are used to dissect consumer perceptions regarding the products they are proposed; methods that are based on the analysis of their verbal responses, in other words, the semantics interface. The impressive evolution of cosmetics' efficacy, presentation and methods of application is based on a set of innovations that require a broad spectrum of scientific knowledge, on which LVMH Recherche gave a wondering overview in a one-day symposium."
"Skin ageing: ""We are in the stage of understanding.""","Patricia Rousselle is one of the French researchers, specialised in skin science, who was trained in the crucible of the Hospital Edouard Herriot in Lyon, where she was an intern in medical biology in the Laboratory of skin substitutes. ""It is initially for the treatment of severely burned patients that the Edouard Herriot Hospital developed a dermatological expertise of a very high level,"" she explains. In 1988, Patricia Rousselle became interested in proteins involved in the mechanisms of adhesion of the epidermis. Autografts which were prepared by the laboratory from cultures of healthy epidermal cells taken from burnt patients were encountering many difficulties due to the lack of adhesion of some epidermal grafts. She then joined Professor Burgeson's team at the Shriners Hospital for Crippled Children (Portland, Oregon), who had just identified and characterized the collagen VII, which plays a major role in anchoring the epidermis to the dermis. Hence, she participated in the discovery of laminin-5 (LN-5), a protein that makes up the filaments involved in the skin adhesion. Additional researches were however necessary before considering clinical applications. ""From the beginning we worked in partnership with cosmetic laboratories interested in the development of active ingredients designed for improving skin condition,"" explains Patricia Rousselle. She therefore continued here works, first in the service of Professor Petit for the treatment of severely burned patients, always within the Edouard Herriot Hospital in Lyons, then with Professor van der Rest's team, at the Institute of Biology and Chemistry of Proteins (IBPC). She briefly returned to the United States for a post-PhD at the Cutaneous Biology Research Centre in the Harvard Medical School (Boston, Mass.), before finally joining the CNRS (French National Center for Scientific Research) in 1995. At each stage, she questions herself on the prospects for implementation of her findings and seeks to combine basic and applied research. With some success, as can be seen by her numerous partnerships with pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries and with clinicians. ""It is the originality of my thematic approaches,"" she says modestly. Shiseido was among the first laboratories interested in here works with the launch in the early 1990s of a range of anti-aging products promoting healing and skin repair. Other big names in cosmetics (Dior, Chanel, Yves Rocher) offered Patricia Rousselle and her team collaboration contracts for specific research missions. In 2006, studies conducted on a peptide fragment of LN-5, in partnership with the Laboratoires d'Anjou, lead to the launch of the LCE balm from the Cebelia range. The balm, protected by a patent was acclaimed by a panel of consumers during the contest called Victoires de la Beauté 2009-2010. ""Restoring the activity of some proteins involved in epidermal junction seems to be more than ever a key element in the fight against signs of aging skin. This is why the cosmetic industry is interested in our works"", explains Patricia Rousselle. She is also currently involved, with her team in the development of anti-aging actives related to the activity of proteoglycans as part of a partnership with BASF Beauty Care Solutions. Over the past two decades, basic research has identified different molecules involved in the functioning of skin cells. According to Patricia Rousselle, this stage is probably completed. But there is a huge gap between the knowledge we have of a protein and understanding what role it has. ""What we are currently studying now are the functions of this catalogue of proteins. We are in the understanding stage. Some of these proteins or cells which had been somewhat sidelined now appear in a new light as we understand a little better their usefulness."" Scientists now have an excellent mapping of the different cells and molecules involved in skin aging and are investigating their interactions. ""On the other hand, we know little about the mechanisms of disturbances involved during the aging process. For example, do they concern degradations or changes in proteins, of a significant diminution in protein synthesis or degradations related to enzymes? It is not because we know a protein that we know the functions and dysfunctions of it."" The interest in having a better understanding of these cellular mechanisms and methods of analysis developed by scientists such as Patricia Rousselle goes of course far beyond the domain of cosmetics. ""I'm more and more interested in aspects related to wound healing in order to develop therapeutic strategies which could be applied in the field of tissue repair and a partnership with the pharmaceutical company, Symatèse Biomatériaux gave birth to a joint patent. I have also developed an interest in adhesion proteins involved in tumorigenesis, to better understand the cellular mechanisms that come into play in the formation of cancers of epithelial origin,"" she explains."
Dermatologists claim retinyl palmitate is safe in sunscreens,"In a commentary published online in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (JAAD), dermatologists Henry Lim, Steven Wang and Stephen Dusza [1] say there is no evidence that retinyl palmitate (vitamin A palmitate) [2] in sunscreens causes cancer. ""Earlier this year, the Environmental Working Group (EWG) [3] issued a health warning that sunscreens containing retinyl palmitate could pose a cancer risk,"" said dermatologist Henry W. Lim, a fellow of the American Academy of Dermatology, chairman of the department of dermatology at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. ""This warning garnered significant media attention and caused considerable confusion among the public. Our report should help dismiss the misinformation that sunscreens are not safe, as sunscreens are vitally important in reducing your risk for skin cancer, not causing it."" Authors of the commentary explain that although retinyl palmitate was selected for testing by the National Toxicology Program (NTP), mere selection does not mean that the chosen compounds are dangerous or unsafe. They say that retinyl palmitate was mainly selected because of its widespread use in cosmetic and sunscreen products. Many common ingredients, such as aloe vera, nanoscale titanium dioxide, and zinc oxide are currently under review by the NTP. The Environmental Working Group's concerns were mainly based on a succession of eight in vitro studies performed since 2002 demonstrating that retinyl palmitate can produce free radicals, which can disrupt cell function. According to Dr. Steven Q. Wang, co-author of the commentary, these non-human studies are too far from the real conditions of use to be biologically relevant. ""For example, when a sunscreen with retinyl palmitate is applied to the skin, a number of antioxidants work together to alleviate the risk of free radical formation seen in these in vitro experiments,"" he said. Dr. Wang and his team also reject the results of a large animal study testing conducted by the NTP whether hairless and albino mice developed tumours sooner when coated in retinyl palmitate versus a placebo cream. In particular, they argued that ""at this time, the findings have not been published in peer-reviewed literature,"" and that ""mice in the NTP study are highly susceptible to the effects of UV radiation and can develop skin cancer or other skin abnormalities within weeks of UV exposure, even in the absence of retinyl palmitate."" Although there are no published human studies on the potential of retinyl palmitate or other retinoids to cause cancer, the commentary concludes that observations from decades of clinical practice do not support the notion that retinyl palmitate in sunscreen causes or promotes skin cancer. ""On the contrary, years of research suggests that retinoids are helpful in reducing your risk for skin cancer,"" said Dr. Wang. ""People should continue vigilantly using sunscreens along with other sun-safe practices – such as limiting sun exposure, seeking shade, and wearing sun-protective clothing, hats and sunglasses – to reduce the risk of skin cancer and premature aging."" The Environmental Working Group has strongly criticised the conclusions of the commentary. The public action group, said it found ""numerous flaws and misleading arguments"" in the commentary published in the JAAD, ""along with undisclosed industry affiliations by two of the three authors."" ""Their fragmentary analysis of a government study exonerates an ingredient used by companies for whom they have done paid consulting,"" said Jane Houlihan, EWG's senior vice president for research."
Five packaging innovations spotted at Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna 2024,"The manufacturer of beauty packaging has introduced a post-consumer-recycled (PCR) polypropylene (PP) that is food compliant and suitable for components in contact with cosmetic bulk. According to Geka, it saves 75% CO2-emissions compared to virgin materials. The new material consists of at least 95% recycled PP plastic. It is completely odourless, and has been tested according to several international standards. The material's ability to meet these standards opens new horizons for the packaging of products such as water-based mascaras. ""Now, for the first time, the packaging can be made entirely from recycled material,"" explains Geka. Furthermore, the new material is optimized for use in cosmetics packaging. It is colour-neutral with no impurities, allowing for a broad spectrum of shade and effect combinations that could not be achieved with conventional recycled materials. ""We can achieve a pure white as well as a deep piano black,"" Geka told Premium Beauty News. Geka also highlights there is no need to change the manufacturing equipment or tooling. Production parameters basically remain the same that with conventional PP. With its new Speed Line program, HCT combines recyclable packaging with fast lead times and low MOQs. The stock is production ready at HCT's facility to accommodate 2,500 – 25,000 pieces in just 2-3 weeks with the client's custom decoration. The specific components for this program are 100% PET monomaterial and are designed for recycling. To maintain the component's recyclability, this program allows limited decoration processes like silkscreen, hot stamping, inkjet printing, and HCT's Inboss Technology. Dubbed Essential, Lumson's new aluminium collection consists of four atmospheric bottles in 50 - 75 - 100 - 150ml sizes, which can be paired with cream pumps (in higher dosages) and sprays. Aluminium is a lightweight and infinitely recyclable material. However, for even more environmental credentials, the Essential range can be made in 100% PCR metal. The new range can be used for a wide range of luxury or masstige products (skincare, body, hair, and sun care). It can be customized with different decorations and effects. The bottles can be combined with dispensing systems in PP or PCR PP. For extra-premium skincare and makeup segments, Berlin Packaging Premi Industries presented Double Glass Refill & Go, a new refillable glass collection available in 15 and 30 ml sizes. This packaging offers consumers the possibility to carry around the product's heart – the glass ampoule and its pump – but also to refill the product quickly and intuitively. The packaging components can be easily separated and differentiated by material at the end of use. In collaboration with, 3D printing specialist Stratasys, and ICA, a global reference point for innovation in glass and plastic coating, Baralan has unveiled a new three-dimensional decoration solution for cosmetic packaging. ""3D printing on glass and plastic is tangible thanks to its adherence to the glass, transparency and charm through the use of infinite colours and designs,"" explains Maurizio Ficcadenti, Global R&D Manager Baralan Group. The new solution is applicable on all the packaging offered by Baralan."
Metsä Board inaugurates a state-of-the-art folding boxboard machine,"Metsä Board, inaugurated its upgraded folding boxboard machine in Husum, Sweden, on the 11th of April. Invited to the inauguration ceremony were, among others, project partners and representatives of Örnsköldsvik municipality, Swedish parliament and the forest industry. In 2016, Metsä Board started up a new folding boxboard machine, BM1, in Husum with a capacity of 400,000 tonnes per year. An investment of EUR 230 million was completed in 2023 to increase the annual capacity of the BM1 folding boxboard machine to respond to the growing demand for sustainably produced packaging materials that support the circular economy. With an increased annual capacity of 600,000 tonnes of folding boxboard, the BM1 is Europe's largest and most modern of its kind and is run with 98% renewable energy. ""With the investment in the folding boxboard capacity at Husum, Metsä Board is well positioned to meet the growing demand for fibre-based packaging materials. We are dedicated to supporting our customers with high quality and resource-efficient solutions that help replace fossil-based materials and support the circular economy,"" says Mika Joukio, CEO, Metsä Board. The project has included upgrades to the entire board mill as well as increasing the warehouse capacity at the port. The main parts of the investment are the extension of the board machine's drying section, a new winder and an automated reel handling system. The new, fully automatic machine roll transfer and control system is unique in the paperboard industry. ""The combination of most modern available technologies with a very high degree of automation solutions gives us both a safer mill as well as lots of new improvement opportunities,"" says Olov Winblad von Walter, VP Husum Board and Pulp Mill. Metsä Board Husum has undergone an extensive investment programme between 2019-2023. The first phase was completed in December 2022, including a new recovery boiler and turbine at the Husum pulp mill with an investment cost of EUR 380 million. The new modern equipment and processes enables Husum mill to significantly increase bio-based energy production and energy efficiency, contributing to Metsä Board's target of fossil free mills by the end of 2030. The Husum mill plays an important role in the large-scale conversion to the bioeconomy. Husum's products play an important role in providing alternatives to fossil-based materials in consumer packaging globally, the main markets being Europe and North America."
Sealester brings unprecedented value to flexible packaging,"Sealester, a French company specialized in flexible packaging, was founded in 2020 by Clément Fourmaux and two partners from the DeltaNeo group, based on an innovative, patented digital welding technology. This technology can be used to assemble a wide variety of materials in free shapes, from prototypes to large production runs. ""The traditional welding method requires large-scale production for the tooling to pay for itself. Our technology breaks down these barriers. Because it works like a 3D printer, it is relevant right from the prototyping phase. We can program our tool to make a weld for one or two models, test certain phases, and then move on to mass production. We can work flexibly from a single model to production runs of several hundred thousand parts"", explains Clément Fourmaux. The Sealester ranges focus on two types of materials: those based on paper fibre composites combined with a polymer film, and those made from polyethylene. In both cases, the aim is to make it all recyclable, either with a sufficient fibre/plastic ratio, or because of the single-material composition. As far as composites are concerned, the company works with various film manufacturers in France and Italy. ""It is always a combination of paper and polymer with as high a fibre ratio as possible, so it can be recycled in the paper industry. We chose to comply with Citeo's specifications, which set the minimum fibre content at 51%. In practice, we are at 75% and trying to go up to 80% with more resistant fibres, but the applications need to be validated. We are also actively looking for polymer-free solutions with even more fibres, but right now they do not meet the mechanical strength specifications"", says the manager. The bestseller Sealester is a paper-based mix of apple fibres that gives a textured feel and a high-end appearance. ""For this range, we have worked on technical solutions to meet specific needs. Two years ago, we were the first to offer liquid refills with a paper base, and we are still the market leader,"" notes Clément Fourmaux. These new materials combine several key advantages. They offer advanced protection against humidity, UV rays and oxidation, ensuring the safety of care products. They are also recyclable, in line with the ecological commitment of Sealester and its customers. At the Paris Packaging Week, the company also showcased the new Lauri pack, a large-capacity design for 750ml- or 1-litre composite refills with improved mechanical strength. ""In general, when you increase the volume of flexible packaging, you increase the thickness, and therefore lose out on ecodesign. This solution meets both the strength and ecodesign criteria"", explains the co-founder. The final asset of Sealester flexible solutions is decoration, one of the weaknesses of traditional flexible packaging. Sealester offers a range of papers with sophisticated textures and finishes, including swelling varnish, metallization, hot foil stamping, and embossing. ""Embellishment is an important point for these products. We are keen to provide solutions that comply with cosmetics codes, for brands that do not want to damage their image by using this type of packaging,"" says Clément Fourmaux. The only obstacle pointed out by the Chairman is the price. ""Some of these refills are more expensive than the bottle, because in the field of flexible packaging, each project is a unique piece requiring specific printing and calibration. But that is something we have been working on,"" he concludes. This article was published in our special issue Beauty Packaging Innovation. Full text available here."
"Albéa C&F, a long-time expertise for even more responsible lipsticks","As the must-have beauty product, lipstick is doing well and has a bright future ahead of it. By 2026, the market is expected to grow by over 15%* worldwide. At Albéa Cosmetics & Fragrance, the manufacturing of lipsticks has been a core expertise of the company since many years. Established in Plouhinec, in Brittany, France, 47 years ago, the Albéa site has for almost 10 years been the Group's European center of excellence in the manufacturing of lipstick caps, bases and mechanisms - a complex technical process requiring more than 20 manufacturing steps. This know-how also extends to Asia: with the Shanghai site, its second center of excellence, Albéa offers metallization and decoration capabilities for both local and international brands. Reducing the carbon footprint of its packaging and participating in a circular beauty economy is at the heart of Albéa Cosmetics & Fragrance's strategy. In both Plouhinec and Shanghai, the development teams have been working for several years on three main areas: – materials – recyclability – mono-materiality – refillability One of today's biggest challenges is the transition to more environmentally friendly materials that drive packaging recycling. Albéa Cosmetics & Fragrance's objective for 2025 is to offer a standard range that no longer includes styrenics such as ABS. To promote the recyclability of packaging, the company is also focusing on specific materials for its new developments. In 2023, the Plouhinec team added a new design to the Breizhstick product range, a family of sticks made from polypropylene (PP) thus recyclable at their end of life. At the same time, the Shanghai team developed Unigreen, a mono material and refillable mechanism consisting of 3 parts, all made from PET. The short-term objective is to combine this mechanism with a cap and a base, both also made from PET, to create a lipstick that is recycling-ready at the end of life. As part of its quest for operational excellence, Albéa Cosmetics & Fragrance is developing the lipsticks of tomorrow - caps, bases and mechanisms that meet the expectations of different markets and brands: compatible with a wide range of formulas, customizable but above all desirable and responsible."
PM Studio aims to bring promotional products to new heights with AI,"With sales of EUR65 million in 2023, PM Studio has risen in record time from the status of a start-up to that of a key player in gift-with-purchase and top-of-the-range packaging. With 78 employees in Europe and China, and a sales presence in New York, PM Studio boasts strong expertise in the cosmetics sector, which accounts for 90% of its business. ""This sector means we have to be highly responsive to trends while respecting brand identity and strong CSR requirements,"" explains Patricia Stranik, the company's CEO. EcoVadis Platinum certified and B Corp certified in 2023, the company emphasises its ethical and environmental commitments, which leverage its ability to create its materials, thanks to a dedicated R&D team and a suite of integrated software for calculating the environmental footprint of projects. ""This allows us to offer different solutions to our customers, with full transparency on the environmental footprint of materials and factories,"" adds Patricia Stranik. On the production side, the design studio relies on a network of around thirty factories in China, including six master players, which meet extremely strict CSR specifications. PM Studio also has partners in Cambodia and Vietnam, in India for fair a trade certification, and in southern Europe and France for customers who request it or for specific projects. Another of the company's strengths is its creativity, which is directly inspired by the fashion world. ""Brands need fresh ideas, and they appreciate our ability to create innovative, sustainable materials and to adapt them to their DNA. We have our stylists, and our customers see us above all as a creative agency and come to our showroom to look for ideas before even presenting us with their briefs,"" points out the CEO. To speed up the creative and design processes while staying as close as possible to the latest trends, PM Studio has invested heavily in digitising its tools and processes, notably through the acquisition of the Édition Limitée company in 2023. By integrating an artificial intelligence unit, PM Studio aims to further optimise the design process by analysing data on the latest market trends more quickly and efficiently, while letting designers do the final touches. Since its creation, PM Studio has grown at an average annual rate of 18%, thanks in particular to external growth operations - acquisitions of By No in September 2022 and Édition Limitée in early 2023 - and the company intends to maintain this trend next year. To achieve this, the company will be investing in new premises in Paris to bring its teams together in a single location and will pursue its investment in digital technology to stay at the cutting edge of innovation and attract new customers, particularly in China, the United States, and the Middle East."
Refill solutions are becoming the norm in beauty packaging,"The overall aim is to create convenient refill solutions, while preserving brands' premium experiences. Glass suppliers are responding to this challenge in several categories. The Pochet Group has developed several models of skincare jars fitted with different refill systems. Odyssey is a glass-based jar with a glass cup held in place by an interface designed for mobile use. The more recent Marvelous is a prestige skincare jar involving intuitive gestures. The jar and refill are made of glass, and the hidden refill feature gives it high-end aesthetics. Another version, the Malti jar, comes in a multitude of materials – wood, glass, metal – for the jar and cup, and is associated with a gesture that is as intuitive as ever. For their part, Stoelzle and Technicaps offer a new generation of Le Perpétuel refillable glass jars, with a 100% PP-based, recyclable cup. Stoelzle modified the dimensions of the Classic 50-ml jar with special features on the top of the ring to accommodate a refillable 50-ml cup. The system incorporates an opening zone for positioning the cup's notches, a support zone to prevent the cup from being withdrawn through transfer, and a blocking zone to ensure the cup stops moving. The whole system makes it easy for consumers to attach and remove the cup. Gerresheimer and Medicos Beauty Group joined forces to develop a new clickable refill system for cosmetics. It combines the Gerresheimer Gx-CyClic reusable glass with the Medicos 50-ml Re-CliCK cup and a plastic lid, also made by Medicos. The lightweight glass jar is made from 40% recycled PCR glass, while the interior is made from biosourced PP, and the cap from R-PET, PET, or PP. All materials are recyclable after use. The clickable solution offers easy and intuitive handling of the refill packs. Finally, Verescence combined its expertise with that of Albéa to create a premium glass version of the TWIRL plastic-based refillable jar originally developed by Albéa. The base, produced by Verescence in Spain, is made from Verre Infini® 20: it incorporates 20% of Post-Consumer Recycled (PCR) glass and the shade meets luxury brands' aesthetic requirements. The lid, cup and top, all manufactured at Albéa, are made from polypropylene (PP), a recyclable material. The jar was specially designed to create an intuitive gesture for quick and easy refilling. The glassmaker also developed refills made from 20% PCR recycled glass and lightened glass for perfumes: they have already been selected by several L'Oréal brands. Since the end of January, a cap made from biosourced and recyclable Sulapac material has also been available to help reduce the use of plastic. Verescence also created the safety glass designed for refilling hygiene products that is now available in a standard range called Céleste. Berlin Packaging took a different approach for Double Glass Refill & Go, a new refillable solution for the extra-premium packaging segment available in 15-ml and 30-ml sizes. The double-walled design of this collection makes it possible to reuse the outer glass bottle and refill it with a new tubular glass vial to beautify cosmetics formulas. For its part, Asquan showcased a premiumized, 100% refillable version of its Migo range, with recyclable, styrene-free 30-ml or 50-ml jars made from PP or PE, or even with some PCR, depending on the brand's requirements. In the same range, Asquan also offers styrene- and metal-free refillable and recyclable airless bottles in 30-ml and 50-ml versions. ""There is a strong demand for high-end refillable solutions"", explains Éric Goyer, Area Sales Director at Asquan. ""We have modernized the design of our Migo range to meet these expectations, and we have also been working on glass solutions that are very much in demand in the luxury industry. By working on aesthetics, we can obtain a long-lasting product with the potential for strong differentiation"". Like Asquan, most airless technology specialists have adapted their models so they can be reused, as can be seen with the Baïa Refill range by Lablabo. The pack consists of the glass or PE bottle, a PE or aluminium pouch for sensitive formulas, the pump, and the cap and collar. Lablabo also developed the Select range for large capacities up to 400 ml, which comes in several pump models. In the maxi refill segment, Pinard Beauty Pack unveiled a light version of its Dolce bottle with extremely thin walls, perfectly suited to refill sizes. Berlin Packaging also put forward a new collection of refillable glass-based airless solutions: Airglass Slim Refill & Go is available in 15, 30 and 50-ml sizes. The collection consists of a glass-based outer bottle and a PP insert integrating the airless technology. It is designed for travel, thanks to the pump's safety clip. As a high-end application specialist, Cosmogen is increasingly pushing for the reuse of its highly-specialized tube tips. Designed to be fully separable, the packs featuring an applicator and an ON/OFF closing system in the Maxi Squeeze'n range now boast their own refill, which can adapt to any applicator. Considered a promising trend in the cosmetics industry, the use of organic, renewable materials as an alternative to traditional plastics, even if they can be recyclable, is becoming more widespread and is associated with the refill trend. Supplier Somater introduced two projects in the prototyping phase. The first is a moulded fibre cup made from virgin or recycled cellulose. Laminated to make it suitable for food contact, the cup can be decorated using digital printing, In-Mold Labelling (IML), embossing, or labelling. There are various types of barriers, including applying a PE or PP film after the cup has been moulded, which represents less than 5% of the total weight to guarantee recyclability. The second is a thermoformed refill incorporating a combination of seaweed starch and polypropylene or polyethylene, the whole being recyclable. The material is sourced from green algae, recovered and recycled in the south of France. The use of seaweed starch produces a velvety, silky texture with a pleasant feel. The compound can be combined with colorants to create a range of colours, from white to black, including pastel shades. Plus, screen printing and hot stamping can be used for decoration purposes. Technicaps took the same approach with a standard glass jar fitted with a moulded pulp cup with a smooth, white, shiny finish. The PP barrier material does not affect recyclability. This version, which can be recycled in the paper sorting process, is currently being tested and due to be finalized at the end of the year. In the makeup segment, lipsticks represent a pioneering category when it comes to refillability. In terms of sustainability, it often seems more feasible to refill the stick than to recycle the product, as recycling requires a monomaterial approach to technical packaging, with elements that are difficult to separate. Axilone actually worked on these two strategies for its customizable Everlast range, which offers a choice of round or square-shaped monomaterial lipsticks of various diameters, fully based on aluminium, PET or PP, which makes them recyclable. Two patented systems are available: the Lock Key® system and the Clic-Fit® technology also make it possible to safely refill the stick. Asquan had the same goal for its refillable lipstick pack solution 100% made from aluminium. This article was published in our special issue Beauty Packaging Innovation. Full text available here."
Somater partners with Eranova to create algae-based polymer packaging,"Somater has joined forces with French start-up Eranova to create a 100% bio-based line of packaging solutions. The partnership aims to provide a sustainable alternative to fossil-based polymers. Somater's new range of biosourced solutions is based on the ALGX material developed by Eranova from green algae collected on the banks of a brackish water lagoon near Marseille, in the south of France. Then, the algae undergo a starch enrichment process in large ponds where they continue to draw CO2 from the atmosphere. The starch is then extracted and transformed into processable bio-based resin. This technology has the advantage of using an invasive natural resource that does not compete with agrarian crops. Furthermore more, green algae can absorb up to 10 times more CO2 per hectare than forests: enough to guarantee an exceptional environmental footprint! To create its primary packs, Somater uses an innovative combination of the ALGX biosourced material with PP/PE, thus resulting in a recyclable solution. ""100% bio-based combinations or those incorporating PCR (Post-Consumer Recycled) are also offered. These formulations provide brands with a wide range of options, the positive environmental impact of which is well-documented through standardized Life Cycle Assessments,"" said Somater in a statement. The resin is claimed to be applicable across various manufacturing processes, including injection moulding, extrusion blow moulding, and thermoforming. According to Somater, the use of ALGX material gives the product a velvety and silky texture, offering a luxurious tactile experience. The compound with natural ""toffee"" tones can be available in a palette ranging from white to black, including pastel colours. Screen printing and hot stamping decoration options can add an extra touch of elegance. Different packaging formats were presented during the Paris Packaging Week in January 2024, including jars, bottles, caps, closures, and cups.

Guyenne transforms paper into a sustainable alternative to plastic,"With the general awareness of the environmental impact of plastic containers and in anticipation of new regulatory constraints (in France, the AGEC law requires a 25% reduction in the use of single-use plastic packaging by 2025), several sectors — including food and cosmetics — are turning to cellulose and paper for various packaging applications. To meet this challenge, Guyenne Papier, a coating specialist, is working to develop processes consisting of coating raw paper with a layer that gives it predefined properties. ""We work with the cosmetics industry, in particular, to give paper, properties that make it grease-resistant, waterproof, and heat-sealable. We are now achieving barrier levels that are relatively high compared with what paper can offer,"" says Céline Procop, Director of the Dordogne-based company. The processes used by Guyenne Papier for the Sunibarier range are unique in that they can achieve high levels of performance using biosourced and biodegradable treatments. Greenbee papers offer a grease-proof barrier with heat-sealable packaging that is 100% biobased and compostable. ""For water barriers, we use synthetic, partly biodegradable polymers. We are really aiming for biodegradability and our objective is to offer products that are also alternatives to paper + PE complexes which, once assembled, cannot be recycled. The products we coat remain monomaterials and can incorporate a dislocation of the layer that does not contaminate the product's recycling cycle,"" assures the President. Guyenne Papier's applications guarantee a 3 to 6-month-proof barrier function and are particularly suitable for use as cosmetic refills. A surface treatment can also be added to improve the printability of the paper and make it easier to decorate. As an upstream player in the value chain, Guyenne Papier works jointly with brands to provide its clients - printers and packaging converters - with optimised base materials. The President of Guyenne Papier is keen to highlight the importance of this activity, in a context where paper material is being put to good use in the packaging sector. ""Few people know that there are companies like us, who are already capable of providing viable industrial solutions, with highly functional products. To those who still have doubts about this transition from plastic to paper, I say give our paper and paperboard a try,"" concludes Céline Procop. This article was published in our special issue Beauty Packaging Innovation. Full text available here."
Finishing: Val Laquage banks on automation and seeks to grow,"Founded in 1998 and driven by the dynamism of its founder and director Valérie Tellier, Val Laquage, which is part of the Val Fi family group, along with Piochel and Inserdeco, has won recognition from its partners in the luxury goods sector through investment and optimization. The Normandy-based group now boasts three production sites and a turnover of €20 million. ""In 26 years, we have grown from 4 to 240 people, and over the past three years, our turnover rose from 12 to 20 million euros"", says Valérie Tellier, who is also the President of Glass Vallée. ""Part of our business directly has to do with some of the biggest brands in the perfume market, and the other with glassmakers, including our long-standing customer Gerresheimer. Our reputation is really built on our technical skills and the complementary nature of our trades, which cover all typologies: lacquering, decoration, screen printing, pad printing, and hot stamping,"", she adds. To meet the growing demand, Val Laquage has made massive investments in automatic decoration lines, with particular emphasis on hot stamping. Today, with 13 lacquering lines and around 50 decorating machines, including ten dedicated to hot stamping, the company is positioned as a major player in the industry. In addition to its commercial success, Val Laquage has for several years been committed to social and environmental improvements in its production processes. ""Environmental concerns are in our DNA"", says the manager. ""We switched to 98% waterborne lacquering in 2009, we have been recovering rainwater for more than 10 years, we make sure everything takes place on the same site to avoid transport, and we adapt our techniques to recycled glass and recover all our waste. But we are also doing a lot of social work with our teams, because that is where respect starts"", continues Valérie Tellier. Also to support innovation, last September, the company installed a new lacquering line designed to pave the way for the transition from traditional techniques to the more sustainable UV curing technology. This test line will be used to validate the processes for a complete industrial switchover in 2025. To keep growing, Valérie Tellier plans to develop Val Laquage by actively seeking acquisitions that will help both achieve a balance between the lacquering and decoration activities, in terms of equipment, and develop logistics. Val Laquage currently exports 60% of its business in Europe, and has no plans to expand internationally for the time being. ""We are moving forward slowly, and developing gradually. What is important is working with the teams. All the major decisions are taken collectively, by people who grew up with the company and want to see it continue to grow"", Valérie Tellier concludes. So far, this business philosophy has ensured the company its success."
Lyspackaging seeks to raise funds for biosourced and biodegradable packs,"After two years of R&D, Lyspackaging launched its first products in 2017. Its business is based on research into plant and organic materials as alternatives to plastic, and technical solutions for designing bottles, jars, caps, and pill boxes for the food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries. The range covers capacities from 20 ml to 1 litre, with more to come. ""The innovation we bring is based on research into new materials, such as flax, hemp, reed, oyster shells, avocado pits, seeds, etc. – we carry out continuous testing to come up with new products – as well as into the processing of these materials, which we inject and blow. It requires a high level of technical expertise"", explains Leslie Martineau, France and Global Sales and Marketing Director. In May 2023, Lyspackaging released the Végécos model, with a jar and cap, in 50 and 120-ml sizes, to match the codes of the beauty world. Made entirely from injected organic materials, this food contact product is compatible with all types of formulations, in theory. ""We still recommend that our customers carry out tests to check the material and pH compatibility, but it is also compatible with liquid formulas"", adds Leslie Martineau. Végécos is designed for stacking jars, both for a product range and secure shipping. ""We have also been working on our own bottle offering and developments specifically for our customers, as well as on refill models"", she adds. Several young brands have already opted for this solution: launches are scheduled for 2024. Entirely plant-based, the Lyspackaging packs are also biodegradable within 90 days through industrial composting. In France, consumers currently have to put them in their recycling bins or in an industrial collection and composting system. Based near the western city of Saintes, the startup employs about 20 people, and in early 2024, it launched a campaign on the crowdfunding Tudigo platform to raise up to EUR 1 million. The aim is to continue research into new biomaterials and invest in industrial facilities, with a new factory nearby to increase production, but also to target international markets with a roll-out throughout Europe, particularly in the cosmetics industry. ""In addition, we do not want empty packs to travel long distances, so we work with partners to produce in local factories. It is already the case in Mauritius for the food industry, in Guadeloupe, and we also have plans for Tahiti in 2024 to bottle Monoï"", concludes the director.

Zamak: myths and facts about the circularity of a little-known material,"The alloy takes its name (zamak or zamac) from its composition, which is 95% Zinc, a widely available material extracted with low CO2 emissions, and 4% Aluminium, followed by Magnesium and Copper (Kupfer, in German). While often unknown to the general public, zamak is an everyday material used by consumers in a wide range of applications, including the automotive industry, hardware, and tapware. In cosmetics and perfume, it is used to create caps or decorative elements for bottles, appreciated for its resistance and the possibility of creating complex shapes, but also for its cool feel and density, in keeping with the codes of luxury. Mainly composed of zinc, zamak is - like this widely used metal - endlessly reusable at the end of its life, with no loss of properties. But like all materials, it has to be collected for recycling. TNT Group, the leading manufacturer of zamak caps for the perfume industry, now wants to accelerate this circularity process. To this end, the manufacturer has joined forces with the REAZN Group, the European leader in recycled zamak. ""REAZN buys collected zamak to manufacture recycled zamak. Our products, even galvanised or with a plastic insert, can be easily recycled. So we asked ourselves how we could supply REAZN with zamak caps,"" explains Thomas Diezinger, President of TNT Group. With the support of the CEDRE network, which recovers empty perfume bottles from Sephora stores, 5 tonnes of zamak were recovered and transformed into recycled ingots. ""With CEDRE, the Nordechets Group generally recovers the glass from the bottles and the alcohol residue, while the rest is incinerated. This time, we were able to add zamak to the collection, and what represented a cost - because we had to manage its disposal - has become a resource that REAZN can exploit,"" comments Thomas Diezinger. But as we know, not all perfume bottles are returned to the shop to be collected and integrated into specialised recycling channels. For the consumer, the other solution is to place the packaging of the product at the end of its life - including decorative elements and caps - in the appropriate sorting bin. To find out what happens to the zamak parts that end up in the household waste stream, Metapack, a company that also specialises in designing top-of-the-range zamak packaging, boxes, and caps for the beauty industry, set out to track their journey through the sorting centres. With the help of the Derichbourg company, using Eddy-current testing, the team was able to see that 90% of zamak parts were collected when they were alone in the sorting process, and 77% when they were mixed with other items. It should be noted that the shape and size of the object impact its detection: long items such as sprays are more easily selected and recovered (between 95 and 100%), whereas round objects, which can roll down the conveyors, are only detected at 40%. ""It's important to note that zamak is well detected in existing channels. This means it can potentially be recycled,"" says Annette Der Minassian, CEO of Metapack. Finally, PVL Beauté, a manufacturer of premium packaging, looked at the data needed to analyse a product's life cycle with a zamak component. The company found that the environmental impact analysis tools available, Spice by Quantis and Bee by Citeo, lacked the right information, particularly on zamak grades and the associated process. Based on approximate data, the LCA is not representative. ""We aim to help Quantis and Citeo fill in their databases as accurately as possible, to avoid a poor rating by default. This is underway with the organisations concerned, but we are only at the beginning,"" says Jean Stanislas Orlowski, CEO of PVL Beauté. While several unknowns remain, the initial results are more than encouraging. Collected through specialised channels, zamak is easily integrated into recycling channels. In the domestic waste stream, it can be sorted with all non-ferrous metals using eddy currents. It remains to be seen what happens to it next, which will probably vary according to the size and equipment of the sorting centres. Although little known, probably because of the small quantities used in packaging, ""this material has remarkable aesthetic and technical qualities for the production of parts with complex shapes,"" stresses designer Alnoor Mitha de Bharat.

"""Business should be brisk at the end of the year"", Didier Bourgine, Augros","Premium Beauty News - How has Augros been doing since the beginning of the year? Didier Bourgine - We became a listed company in 1997 and we have just published our 2023 sales figures: they reached about EUR 20.8 million, representing a 2% growth compared with 2022, although there has been a slowdown since June 30th, when we were up 13%. In fact, just like the market as a whole, we experienced a downturn in the last quarter due to a global period of destocking following the Covid pandemic. Therefore, our business slightly slowed down at the start of the year, but if market figures are anything to go by, sales are still growing, so the destocking event should be temporary, and it should all pick up again in the second quarter. We do expect a number of launches from all brands, which confirms a reassuring dynamism foretelling brisk business towards the end of 2024. Premium Beauty News - What are the company's strengths in such a context? Didier Bourgine - Well, those of an SME that has invested heavily in recent years. First, we invested on a massive scale, in packaging, i.e. in plastics processing, between 2010 and 2015, so now we have a highly automated production facility. Since 2018, we have also stepped up our investments in surface treatment at our plant in Normandy. In this area, the plant was totally manual five years ago, and it is now 60% automated. It represents a major investment totalling more than EUR 7 million over five years for this division. Premium Beauty News - Why did you decide to invest in surface treatment? Didier Bourgine - Because it is necessary, both to improve the reliability of industrial processes and to optimize costs. But also to respond to environmental and CSR constraints, which drive us to improve the quality of our processes and treatments by increasingly using high solid coatings, and therefore to significantly reduce our use of solvents and VOC emissions. Ten years ago, our high solid coating/solvent ratio was 20/80, and in three years' time it will be 80/20. It is a small chemical revolution in terms of the nature of the products we use to carry out our surface treatments, whether varnishing, lacquering or vacuum metallization, which are the basis of our expertise in this field. Premium Beauty News - Do you also meet CSR constraints in the plastics sector? Didier Bourgine - In this area, we will be increasing our use of recycled materials from 20% to over 75% within the next two years. Today, the injected parts we make have a ratio of recycled materials of about 40%. They are mainly based on rPET or PPr that we buy, and the rest comes from the sprues recycled from the products we manufacture. We are also developing new products with materials that are 100% recyclable in the ferrous metals sector. That is an excellent alternative to Zamak – both aesthetically pleasing and more economical. Premium Beauty News - With two production sites based in Normandy – Alençon for plastics and Val au Perche for finishing –, employing over 175 people, you meet the needs of many players in the luxury market, particularly high-end perfumes, with tailor-made products (jars, caps, bottles). What are your development plans, in particular on the global scale? Didier Bourgine - There are a great many luxury brands in France, and most of those that are not French have their R&D pack or even purchasing centre in Paris, so when you are lucky enough to be two hours from Paris, you are lucky enough to be two hours from the decision-makers of 80% of the global market! So, we are not looking to expand internationally in the short term, but rather to consolidate our existing customer base and attract new customers. We are fortunate to be a company with over 100 years' experience, so we have a great deal of expertise in developing packaging for the luxury market, as well as a base of high-performance suppliers for supplements. We also pride ourselves on our agility and speed of development and execution, since we integrated a mechanical engineering workshop that enables us to move very quickly through the final development phases, between the presentations of the first parts and the final approvals. Finally, we are now in a position to automate our processes and ensure the reliability and repeatability needed to guarantee quality and dependable supply for our customers."
"""We produce close to our customers' main markets,"" Sophie Ivens, Rissmann","What was the purpose of opening the U.S. office ? Sophie Ivens - Our aim is to be a local relay for international brands and to respond to national key accounts, in diversified segments — perfumes and beauty, fashion, wines and spirits, delicatessen, electronics — all of which share a luxury or premium positioning. We produce from 50,000 pieces upwards, but sometimes produce smaller quantities to support high-potential brands. That's why Laura joined Rissmann. She has over 15 years' significant experience in the beauty and hygiene sectors in particular. Rissmann has also announced its ability to produce in North America. In what way? Sophie Ivens - Our objective is to have the capacity to produce the same packaging, with the same quality standards, on three continents — in Asia, Europe and North America — close to our customers' main markets, to limit the flow of goods. In Europe, we have our own factories in Germany - next to the Nuremberg headquarters - and in Bulgaria, then a network of industrial partners in Hungary. In Asia, we have an industrial partner in Qingdao, in addition to the Design Quality office and the sales office in Hong Kong. We have therefore selected trois industrial partners in Mexico, who are committed to Rissmann, following a charter of confidentiality and quality, not only in terms of production, but also environmental, social and ethical in addition to holding the required certificates, FSC in particular. We carried out careful work and carried out numerous audits to ensure that all safety, compliance, quality and sustainability criteria were met. How is production capacity structured at global level and what are the latest news ? Sophie Ivens - Strengthening production capacities in Europe has always been on Rissmann's agenda, well before the covid crisis. And the plan is progressing in accordance with what was announced: we have just inaugurated the extension of our Bulgarian factory, which opened its doors in 2022. An additional 4,000 m2, or 7,000 m2 in total, are dedicated to manufacturing paper bags and boxes of all kinds. Automation has been extensively rolled out and optimized to gain agility and flexibility. We can quickly access the variations desired by our customers, in terms of models, but also production volumes. We free ourselves as much as possible from time-consuming manual operations. While having a valuable capacity for adaptation, thanks to our Hungarian expert partners. We maintain a regular rotation with them and it is reassuring for our customers to know that we can triple our production capacity, with complete confidence. Rissmann uses 60% solar energy. What is your strategy regarding sustainability? Sophie Ivens - We have finalized our carbon footprint assessment for Germany at the end of 2023 and Rissmann's global carbon report will be finalized by spring. We are committed to the CDC (Carbon Disclosure Program). It is extremely instructive and virtuous since ultimately, economy and ecology go hand in hand. We design single-material packaging in paper and cardboard, 98% FSC certified, equipped with clever closing and fixing systems, without magnets or plastic. And if there is plastic, generally as an option like for the Enby dust cover for example, then it is PET PCW, coming from the oceans. Our models are also designed to minimize transport and storage volumes. What are the prospects for 2024? Sophie Ivens - Growth was particularly strong from 2019 to 2023, to the point of almost doubling our turnover. I'm looking at 2024 with cautious optimism and the aim to grow our capacity to adapt! We are continuing our strategy of regionalization of production, more or less quickly depending on the geopolitical and health factors causing a certain instability. Our values remain agility, responsibility, innovation, solidarity, excellence. We have cutting-edge technologies such as laser engraving and cutting, but also embossing and folding. We are very well placed in the world of beauty and would be delighted to be further challenged by the Wines & Spirits, delicatessen and electronics sectors. See you at Luxe Pack Shanghai in April then at Luxe Pack New York in May!"
Tesem and Constellium join forces to close the loop of aluminium recycling,"Thanks to its visual and sensory qualities, aluminium has long been a key material in luxury packaging. For Tesem, it is also a key asset in facilitating in the transition towards greater sustainability. ""Of course, brands will have the final say, but we have hardly any doubt about their willingness to reduce the amount of plastics used in their products. From this perspective, aluminium represents a first-rate alternative, thanks to its aesthetic qualities and its endless recyclability,"" explains Patrick Bousquel, the newly appointed Marketing and Sales Director of the Catalan group. However, the aesthetic requirements of the luxury industry are not always compatible with the specificities of recycled aluminium. Actually, a large part of available volumes comes from lower grade food packaging and cannot be not readily used to make high-end packaging components. To overcome this difficulty and provide a recycled aluminium with the same performance and appearance as virgin metal, Tesem has partnered with Constellium, an aluminium supplier that also has recycling capabilities. As part of this partnership, aluminium scraps not used by Tesem are returned to Constellium to be re-melted and re-rolled so that they can be reused. ""We have built a closed loop between our factory and Constellium. We therefore reuse luxury grade aluminium in our products based on a mass balance calculation. This reduces CO2 emissions by up to 70% compared to virgin aluminium,"" says Patrick Bousquel. The solution is claimed by Tesem as a ""low-carbon"" aluminium offering. ""Tesem's approach to aluminium demonstrates our commitment to our customers to meet their needs for beauty packaging combining luxury, innovation and environmental responsibility,"" emphasizes Albert Sala, Tesem Group's CEO. During Paris Packaging Week, Tesem also unveiled several innovations from its innovation platform based in Torellò, Catalonia. In addition to a series of novelties exclusively showcased to customers, the group has highlighted its FUSE technology which makes it possible to create invisible connections between anodized aluminium parts, even in hidden areas. The solution eliminates the need for glue or additional plastic parts, to create 100% aluminium components. For instance, FUSE can be used to create a mono-material cap, made by fusing two aluminium shells together, forgoing the need for a plastic insert. Also with the aim to anticipate on the emerging no-low trend regarding plastics in beauty packaging, Tesem showcased its DOTS technology, which is another way to eliminate the plastic insert from the aluminium cap, thanks to micro-sized friction points. With a turnover of 100 million euros for the entire group in 2023, Tesem Group intends to meet the new challenges of beauty packaging by relying on the complementarity of its know-how in metal with Tesem, in plastic injection and robotic assembly with Novassu, and in the supply of turnkey solutions with Flosty."

"Fedrigoni structures ""Special Papers"" division around four business units","After a successful year and a series of acquisitions, the Fedrigoni Group, which counts almost 5,000 employees in 28 countries, achieved sales of EUR 2.3 billion in 2022, divided between two major activities, EUR 1.3 billion for the Labels division, and EUR 1 billion for Speciality Papers. To optimize its growth, the Speciality Papers division is now being reorganized on the global level into four business units. – Luxury Ecosystem covers speciality papers for the luxury industry designed for packaging and communication. The Paris-based management works with dedicated teams in the various international offices. ""Luxury goods customers need to work with a global organization capable of carrying out a project on different continents. With 12 paper machines worldwide, we also have the agility and flexibility that these customers expect, even for small production runs"", says Ilan Schinazi, the Sales Director of Fedrigoni Papers. The Luxury business unit already accounts for 35% to 40% of the Group's sales, with established partnerships with leading luxury groups. However, they aim to reach 60% within the next three years, in particular by expanding into the North American and Asian markets. – The Creative Communication business unit is dedicated to creative papers for the publishing and creative communication industries. Fedrigoni is one of the world leaders in this market, which represents almost 40% of its sales. – Technical Solutions includes highly specialized products, from RFID to smart papers, and from speciality papers designed to replace plastic in many applications to playing and trading cards. The group is currently developing the market for hotel room key cards and gift cards. – Art and Drawing represents the wide range of drawing papers produced by the historic Fabriano factory based in southern Italy. In addition, Fedrigoni has just completed three new acquisitions aimed at consolidating its geographical presence, technological development, and CSR approach based on the ""plastic to paper"" strategy. Having already purchased the Guarro Casas Arjowiggins plant in Spain in 2022, in late 2023, the Group integrated the Arjowiggins plant in China, which is specialized in tracing paper and produces 7,000 tonnes per year. ""The logic behind this acquisition is both geographical and CSR-based. We believe that transparent tracing paper can replace plastic in a number of applications"", explains Ilan Schinazi. The second acquisition is SharpEnd, a UK-based agency specializing in the RFID technology. This move follows the acquisition of Tageos France, an expert in connected solutions, in 2022, and of its R&D centre, reinforcing the Group's commitment to smart label and paper solutions. ""We are confirming our interest in this technology with an agency that can help us bring the RFID experience to life for consumers"", notes the director. Finally, Fedrigoni confirmed it acquired 100% of Italian company Eclose, a manufacturer of cellulose-based pulp wedges and packaging – a market with strong potential. The company already works with some fifteen luxury brands. The Group confirmed it signed an agreement with a player from Brazil, the country being the world's leading producer of short-fibre paper pulp. ""This supplier is extremely committed to CSR. They work on preserved forests in the south of the country and boast a productivity of eucalyptus reforestation cycles that is twice that of Nordic countries"", explains the director. After a ""euphoric"" year 2022, according to him, the 2023 result that will be presented in April looks set to be at least equivalent in terms of volume. ""We have also achieved a strong start to 2024. We will have to wait and see for the rest of the year, depending on the geopolitical context, but what is for sure is that there is a huge demand in the luxury sector for value-added speciality papers"", concludes Ilan Schinazi. With its new organization, its four production sites in Italy, France, Spain, and China, and the inauguration of its innovation centre in Verona dedicated to high-end papers, Fedrigoni intends to meet this demand in every respect."
Bormioli Luigi invests in sputtering decoration for glass vials,"A well-known technique in the world of plastic packaging, the use of sputtering is much less common for the decoration of perfume glass vials. Eager to provide its customers with innovative industrialized techniques that meet today's environmental challenges, Bormioli Luigi has invested two million euros in the creation of a new production line dedicated to sputtering in its factory in Parma, Italy. Sputtering is akin to vacuum metallization. It offers product the same shine and resistance to shock, scratches and juices. ""Sputtering gives us more flexibility. It consists of applying the decoration under vacuum using a physical process which distinguishes it from metallization. It not only allows you to obtain metallic effects on the glass but also coloured ones. The technique is interesting from an aesthetic point of view, but above all from a recyclability point of view since it allows you to modulate the transparency of the bottle [1],"" said Emanuela Fava, R&D manager at Bormioli Luigi. Bormioli Luigi's first development project with this new production line dedicated to sputtering, the limited edition of La Vie Est Belle L'Extrait, from Lancôme, perfectly illustrates what can be achieved through this technique. ""The client's request was to obtain a metallic effect combined with a specific shade, that was unique to this edition, while ensuring recyclability thanks to the colour gradient allowing to adjust the opacity of the bottle,"" explained Emanuela Fava. ""Two other developments are underway, but it is still too early to say more,"" concluded Bormioli Luigi's R&D manager."
"Cosmogen debuts Pharma Care, a new offer dedicated to OTC and pharma brands","The French supplier of packaging solutions and applicators will exhibit at Pharmapack for the very first time. The show will be take place in Paris on January 24 and 25, 2024. The aim is to showcase a line of patented packaging dedicated to OTC (Over the Counter) products. ""The offer of OTC products is increasingly competitive, and pharmaceutical industry brands are looking for differentiating solutions,"" explains Maud Lelièvre, Cosmogen's Marketing & Communication Director. ""Some of them clearly identified Cosmogen's expertise and contacted us. Especially since our offer meets the regulatory standards of the pharmaceutical industry."" This offer of around twenty packs is gathered under the Cosmogen Pharma Care banner. The range includes the iconic Squeeze'n range with its ON/OFF closure and nuumerous applicators, as well as the ReUse sticks, particularly suited to solid formulas, which are also increasingly common in pharmacies. The Squeeze'n tubes have been designed to allow the separation of the container and the applicator, either to allow reuse of the latter or to facilitate recycling. For their part, the ReUSe sticks are made from a single material and feature a refill system. Several players in the pharmaceutical sector have already entrusted Cosmogen for their primary packaging. The tube with brush, for example, was selected by Alvadiem for its soothing nail care. For the same claim, others preferred the Squeze'n mini Spatula. The classic Squeeze Roll seduced Boiron for its repairing and relaxing CBD gel. Ceramol's Spot Block, a targeted acne treatment, is packaged in the Spot Tip tube. Pharmagel chose the Maxi Squeeze'n Sculpt for its anti-cellulite body treatment, Mantecorp the dropper tube for its ultra-targeted blancy cis treatment, and Gelol the Triball tube for its relaxing massage treatment. Cosmogen application solutions comply with REACH, FDA Contact, CLP (EC) N° 1272/2008 and CE 1223/2009 regulations and Packaging Waste 94/62/EC."
Chanel and g.pivaudran create mascaras made from recycled aluminium,"The new primary packs of Chanel's ""Le Volume"", ""Le Volume Révolution"" and ""Le Volume Stretch"" mascaras will now contain a share of post-consumer recycled (PCR) aluminium of between 10% and 20%, depending on the decor models. This achievement is the culmination of several years of research into the use of recycled aluminium in the packaging of luxury cosmetic products. Since 2018, Chanel, g.pivaudran and Constellium have led a number of trials in this area. According to g.pivaudran, the purpose of these trials was to remove three main uncertainties: the technical capacity of recycled aluminium to be transformed by deep stamping; the behaviour and aesthetic output following anodization; the ability to maintaining the quality of the decoration. ""The challenge of creating an object, which already has a high degree of technical complexity and uses deep stamping on standard aluminium, whilst perfectly respecting the exacting quality standards of Chanel was met with success. The technical and quality-assurance teams approved the results, rewarding the intensive work carried out in advance by our teams through a number of trials,"" said g.pivaudran in a statement. The green light from the Chanel Parfums Beauté packaging quality teams made it possible to launch the production of three new mascaras incorporating recycled aluminium for a lower environmental footprint. ""We would like to thank Chanel who has allowed us to support it in a strategy which so befits out own image, and which we will continue,"" said Marc Pivaudran, CEO of g.pivaudran. Indeed, a host of other initiatives are currently being led with Chanel Parfums Beauté which will be unveiled throughout 2024."
"""There are no miracle materials,"" Laurine Friche, Albéa C&F","What made you choose packaging as a career, and what excites you about the sector? Laurine Friche - It was pure chance! I started with an internship and was offered a job after I completed it. I have had to adapt quickly as I have worked in three different roles at Albéa in just four years. I feel committed to my current role as I'm in a position that I feel has value for our business and beyond. I'm working at the root of packaging, meaning I can have a direct impact in changing things for the better. I love packaging because it is the first point of contact between the consumer and the work we do in the beauty industry. What are the packaging challenges that you want to overcome? Laurine Friche - At Albéa we contribute to circular economy by committing to make all of our packaging recyclable or reusable by 2025 which is a huge challenge. This requires a deep understanding of regulatory compliance and a lot of work around product safety, material transparency and plastic transformation. My role has a direct impact on this, as I support the company's plants to switch materials to suitable recyclable alternatives. Many different factors have to be considered when proposing new materials. Even packaging size and shape play a role, particularly in cosmetics products. For example, most lipsticks are cylindrical, which means they will roll on flat surfaces. This creates challenges when sorting packs for recycling stream. What is unique in your approach to packaging? How does it play an essential role in your company/the industry? Laurine Friche - My background in chemical engineering gives me a deeper understanding of the materials we use, and the viable alternatives that are worth exploring. Thanks to my initial training and further experience, I better understand the use of PET and its transformation challenges. It is indeed a more complex material to use in injection moulding. What do you see as the future of packaging? Laurine Friche - We cannot do without packaging. Once we understand it we can work to improve things and find productive solutions. The same applies to plastic. There are no miracle materials – it's how we use them that matters. Plastic will still have its place in a responsible packaging industry. It just needs to be adapted to the needs of the circular economy, to be safe and to have a low impact. In this case, that means making recyclable packaging from recycled plastic. What are you most proud of in your career so far? Laurine Friche - I'm proud of joining the CSR team of Albéa C&F because the challenges we face are enormous – and motivating!. We deal with so many different unique packs, and I am happy to have a direct role in finding new ways and coming up with innovative solutions. I feel like as a team, we can really make a difference. What piece of advice would you share with young professionals out there looking to make an impact in packaging? Laurine Friche - Things are about to change and we are only at the beginning of an exciting and challenging journey! Even if some groups like Albéa have been working on sustainable development for over 15 years, I believe we have only taken the first step. Young professionals can write the future of packaging and make the difference to improve the packaging industry. Being passionate and committed to your vision is key. What does it mean to you to be selected as a Future Leader? Laurine Friche - It's a great opportunity to meet players from across the packaging industry and discuss various issues. I wasn't expecting it so I'm really happy! It means a lot to be selected alongside my colleague Mariia Baranova, CSR Project Leader at Albéa, so we can share this experience together.

"Five beauty packaging trends to look out for in 2024, according to Quadpack","In an uncertain context, marked by rising concerns, from climate change and global conflicts, to resource shortages and the rising cost of living, consumers adapt their mindset. And the trends now emerging reflect these changes. The world is changing, and so are we. We are becoming 'Generation Flex' with no fixed identity. This radical changeability demands ultra-personalisation. Artificial intelligence (AI) is thus presenting all kinds of opportunities for beauty brands, from digital diagnostic tools and virtual fragrances, to in-game launches. Shops become experiential spaces, for trying out products you then buy online. Brands connect with their target in new, memorable ways, with pop-up stores, festival events, podcasts and influencer involvement. As far as packaging is concerned, this trend requires to deliver memorable and mindful experiences. Above all, it should appeal to the senses. The ocean is the inspiration for more of a movement than a trend: blue beauty. It is widely recognized that oceans are essential for life on Earth. Brands try to participate in the ocean protection move and marine-derived ingredients are becoming increasingly popular. Formulas that are free from micro-plastics and biodegradable are preferred. In this context, the packaging, if it contains plastic, must also be free of microplastics and preferably recycled. Quadpack also suggests marine-themed decoration, a blue and green reflective colour palette, water-like finishes or 'way-out-there' textures like seapunk neoprene or 'mermaid' scales. As consumers prioritise wellness, overconsumption is rejected and we see a return to basics. Quiet beauty emphasises simplicity and efficacy. Less becomes more. When making purchasing decisions, consumers ask themselves, ""Do I really need it?"" and ""Do I really need a new one?"" Nevertheless, they are willing to pay more for quality. This trend requires packaging solutions able to protect high-performing products and natural ingredients with airtight designs or airless technology. Reuseable formats, offer great value for money, are also part of this mindset. According to Quadpack, noble materials like ceramic and wood fit well here. ""The look-and-feel is one of timeless elegance, a kind of artisanal aesthetic, with minimalist lines."" In a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world, young consumers are working towards a 'protopian' future, where life continues to improve a little every day. Consumer pressure and brands' own sustainability goals are driving companies to improve their impact. In such a context, packaging opt for new materials: biocomposites like Sulapac, recycled plastics, wood, aluminium, leather, cement, terracotta, cork and so on. As far as decoration is concerned, Quadpack says this trend demands a moody, dusky look with organic, but also brutalistic shapes. Metallic finishes and materials can help add that futuristic touch. As we live longer (the 60+ population will nearly double by 2050), the way we age is becoming more important. The focus is on prevention rather than cure, with holistic health and beauty routines. In parallel, our constant digital presence in video conferences, selfies and social media have given rise to a wide array of non-invasive aesthetic therapies and 'tweakments', from cryotherapy to needle-free fillers. 2024 will see the big brands joining the niche brands who kicked off the trend. Depending on the formula, packaging can be designed to help deliver on the claim, for example, by mixing actives with serum in a two-in-one pack or by adding a cold-touch applicator. Mini vials will offer effective solutions for mono doses. ""Aesthetics are pure, clean and laboratory inspired, while new creative concepts for nutri-cosmetics containers may, in turn, transform the look of the traditional 'pill jar',"" highlights Quadpack. ""It's all about being hopeful for the future. Beauty brands are adapting to the new reality and packaging has a crucial part to play. As soon as you see it or touch it, you begin a relationship with the product and the brand,"" concludes Marcia Bardauil, Quadpack's Marketing Lead."
"""Let's prioritize infinitely recyclable packaging,"" Peipei Yang, Trivium","What made you choose packaging as a career, and what excites you about the sector? Peipei Yang - I first arrived in Amsterdam to study Environmental Sciences, focusing on sustainable energy transition. After I finished my studies, there were a lot of sustainability internships open to me. I chose one within an international packaging company because they offered me an opportunity to help define their 2025 sustainability strategy through my project. The whole project really excited me – developing sustainable packaging ideas into things that play a role in our everyday lives. I can see the industry is changing, and it is starting to rethink how products can be more sustainable. I was very excited to see there are so many opportunities and initiatives coming. It will take a cross-industry effort to push the sustainable agenda forward, and being a part of that is exciting for me. What are the packaging challenges that you want to overcome? Peipei Yang - In my current role, I oversee a greater degree of internal engagements and collaborations, between different departments within Trivium. Part of the challenge is ensuring that this process is repeated externally with suppliers and customers. If you're promoting sustainability within your company, the environmental impact of that can be expanded by reaching out to other companies. Another challenge is how we make the product journey more sustainable, from sourcing to design and consumer consumption to end-of-life. For that to happen, we need every stakeholder to think holistically. This kind of collaboration is happening but we as an industry need to embrace it more. When I see that suppliers are not aligned with that way of thinking, it's an opportunity to introduce this topic and have a conversation to build progress. It's about changing mindsets and processes. A lot of companies are not on the right track, which is a challenge, but also an opportunity to educate and elevate them. What is unique in your approach to packaging? Peipei Yang - My role is unique because we don't look at our operations alone, we also look outside the company. 90% of our emissions come from our value chain, so we can't control everything. But we can exert our influence by promoting best practices, training sessions, and so on, which create a cascading impact across the supply chain. For example, I go out to see what our suppliers are doing. We engage to evaluate their performance and see how we can help them become better and improve their ESG performance in line with our goals. If a supplier isn't quite aligned, I don't favour getting rid of them. Instead, I work to help train them and make them part of our planning and strategy. They have to embrace it of course, but 98% of suppliers are quite open, which is amazing. What do you see as the future of packaging? Peipei Yang - We need to consume less packaging, using it only when absolutely necessary. In addition, we should only use packaging that can be recycled forever to ensure it stays in the loop, like metal packaging. I also see a trend of refillable packaging in luxury packaging categories like perfume, which presents another alternative: allowing the end user to easily keep their original branded packaging at home while refilling it using a light-weighted, easy-to-recycle, and user-friendly refill pack. What are you most proud of in your career so far? Peipei Yang - As a project leader, managing our ESG accreditations is part of my role, so I'm proud that we earned a platinum rating from EcoVadis, the world's largest sustainability rating agency. EcoVadis covers the environment, human rights, business ethics, and sustainable procurement. It's a big achievement for us as platinum is the highest ranking available, placing us in the top 1% of all companies assessed globally. The important thing to note about EcoVadis is that the bar is rising every year as more companies get certified, so it's a challenge to continually keep driving improvements across the business in order to maintain that platinum rating, and I am proud to see Trivium is working to meet that challenge. What piece of advice would you share with young professionals out there looking to make an impact in packaging? Peipei Yang - Challenge yourself, take initiative, and don't be shy when sharing your opinion. You have a fresh mind and opinions that your colleagues can take on board. Ask the difficult question: Why do we use this material? Is it really sustainable? Can we make it more efficient? Can we improve our supply chain? People will appreciate you injecting new ideas into the process. For example, in Trivium, new opinions are very much valued at Trivium, my manager always challenges me on how things could be improved and is always happy to hear my answers. So, don't hold back! What does it mean to you to be selected as a Future Leader? Peipei Yang - It's a surprise, my team sent the application in for me as I was not aware of it. I'm really happy and it's a highlight of my career so far. I'm also thankful that my team recognised my work. I want to encourage young professionals in the industry to know that it doesn't matter what your background is, just do your best and one day it will be recognised."

This year's Future Leaders represent the wide range of disciplines that make the packaging industry so vibrant, with representatives from packaging manufacturers, design agencies, and brands, as well as a mix of start-ups and well-established businesses. In addition, the group is truly international, with members from France, UK, South Africa, USA and the Netherlands. The Future Leaders will participate in a panel discussion at the upcoming Paris Packaging Week, sharing their vision of the future direction of the sector and today's challenges that they aim to overcome. Premium Beauty News - For the first time you had to set up a waiting list for exhibitors. WiIl you be able to host more companies next year? Josh Brooks - In 2025 we will move to Hall 1, the largest in the Porte de Versailles exhibition centre. And we are planning new things too!"
"""We need to create a responsible ecosystem,"" Mariia Baranova, Albéa","What made you choose packaging as a career, and what excites you about the sector? Mariia Baranova - In 2020, I completed a master's degree in Ecotoxicology and Ecophysiology at Sorbonne University in Paris. Subsequently, I extended my studies with a one-year program in sustainable development. After that, I started as an apprentice at Albéa and was officially recruited at the end of it. I find fulfilment in contributing to a field that serves a vital purpose. While packaging is essential for the modern world, it poses significant environmental challenges. I'm excited about exploring opportunities to reshape our approach, minimising environmental impact while maintaining functionality. What are the packaging challenges that you want to overcome? Mariia Baranova - Finding the balance between product safety, circularity, and low environmental impact. We need to integrate that balance across all the different stages of product development, from creation to delivery. It is challenging but critical to stay on the right path with the primary goal of deriving social benefits from the product and its production while minimising harm to the environment. It requires a lot of collaboration, internally and externally, and a lot of resources. At the same time, we must act quickly to address the urgent climate and plastic crises, making decisions and taking action based on what we already know and the resources at our disposal that are sometimes limited. What is unique in your approach to packaging? Mariia Baranova - As a CSR Project Leader, I coordinate data collection and sustainability initiatives at global level, aligning our strategies with environmental goals. I map and measure the current state, ensuring that we progress in the right direction when we design a product and implement its manufacturing process. I think it allows stakeholders to make informed decisions, and therefore to make the right ones in terms of environmental impact. What do you see as the future of packaging? Mariia Baranova - In my vision, the future involves responsible products (circular, safe, and low impact) and stresses the importance of sustainability for companies creating these products. Collaborative efforts across the entire value chain, from suppliers and product designers through to consumers and end-of-life, will be crucial to deliver meaningful change. Indeed, we need to create not only responsible packaging but a responsible ecosystem around it. No company can change everything on its own. We need to have a collaborative approach. What are you most proud of in your career so far? Mariia Baranova - Since joining the team, I've significantly increased the amount of auditable data we have access to, which has helped the company to make better-informed decisions. I'm also proud of supporting our facilities to achieve recognition in their sustainable journey, internally and externally. I am proud of the collaborations on projects with my colleagues; we make a great team moving forward! What piece of advice would you share with young professionals out there looking to make an impact in packaging? Mariia Baranova - Stay curious, be proactive, and embrace interdisciplinary knowledge. The packaging industry needs individuals who can bridge the gap between science, sustainability, and business. Rigour in data assessment is crucial, because information is constantly changing in this sector, and you can never know it all! Engage with colleagues and never underestimate the power of collaboration for impactful and long-lasting change because you need to work inside and outside of your organisation to affect change in the whole product life cycle. Collaboration is key - the most important thing if we want to move forward. What does it mean to you to be selected as a Future Leader? Mariia Baranova - Being selected is both an honour and a responsibility, signifying recognition of my commitment to positive change. It's an opportunity to collaborate and learn from other leaders, and it gives a voice and space to young people which is amazing – I'm excited to meet them all this January! To be recognised alongside my colleague, Laurine Friche, material expert, reinforces our company's pride in our work and collaboration.

Start-ups: How does Pardi want to reduce single use packaging in cosmetics,"How was the Pardi brand born? After two years of research and development in partnership with an independent French lab, and whilst continuing our studies, we launched our first product: a glass mascara with a reusable brush. What are the packaging challenges that you want to overcome? Packaging is a major challenge in eco-design, as is the case across all industries, but even more so in the cosmetics sector where single use is still too common. And big challenges are what drive us! We want to build on our momentum and continue producing reusable applicators as well as focusing on glass, the end game being to promote a circular economy and to offer 100% reusable packaging. What is unique in your approach to packaging? Four years ago, when we launched Pardi, there were no mascara brands with reusable wands on the market. We came up with this idea from a consumer point of view. We were always buying the same mascara but ended up having to throw the brush away when it ran out, even though the wand was still in pristine condition. This is why we wanted to offer a glass mascara with a reusable brush. Now, we would also like to change consumers' relationship to packaging and begin to raise awareness about the benefits of reuse. What do you see as the future of packaging? The best pack is the one you don't produce, but it's also the one you don't need to reproduce. Choosing materials, promoting circularity and reusing applicators are for us key components of the future of packaging. What are you most proud of in your career so far? We are proud that we were able to start building Pardi whilst continuing our studies. As a matter of fact, we launched the research and development early in 2020, and we should graduate in 2024! This created an additional challenge that allowed us to grow Pardi with a completely different outlook. What piece of advice would you share with young professionals out there looking to make an impact in packaging? Our advice would be ""Don't be afraid to innovate!"" Even if your solution is not on the market yet, it is essential to take your time meeting a large number of suppliers who will challenge your idea, and to find trusted partners who will make your struggle their struggle. What does it mean to you to be selected as a Future Leader? We took a gamble four years ago. And for a long time, many doors would close in front of us when we would present our innovative packaging idea to people. It took us years to find those trusted partners who would support us and share our unprecedented vision when it comes to reusable packaging. This is the result of two and a half years of research and development, and today we share this nomination with all our partners who helped turn our vision into a reality.

"At Cosmopack Asia 2023, FSKorea focuses on sustainability","FSKorea has showcased its latest innovations at the Cosmopack Asia tradeshow, which was held from 14 to 16 November 2013, at the Asia World Expo Centre, near Hong Kong's international airport. The main feature of the presentation is Go Brush, FSKorea's latest make-up brush concept, whose fibres, ferrule and handle can be taken apart, allowing consumers to sort them out for recycling. The three separable components not only facilitate recycling but also help to reduce glue consumption. Another advantage is that consumers can change the handle, the ferrule (which can be of a different colour) and the type of fibre as they wish. But that's not all! FSKorea also highlighted its range of recyclable packaging with a pump or dropper. Thanks to its cap entirely made from a PP-based material and its PETG pipette, the Eco Dropper, for instance, is fully recyclable. As part of its eco-friendly collection, FSKorea also showcased its DTP Easy Clean pump, a refillable product that helps to lower the environmental impact throughout the production chain by reducing the amount of materials and energy used. FSKorea has designed this pack with a wide-necked container that leaves enough space for easy cleaning before recycling. Refillability was a strong point of the products presented by FSKorea in Hong Kong with, in particular, a refillable mascara, which was previewed in Singapore in 2022. To refill, the consumer just has to remove the cover with a simple pull and remove the inner bottle from the outer container by turning the shoulder counter-clockwise (just see our video here). Another new feature is the ALPRD Recyclable Airless Pump where the spring has been removed, whether metal or plastic. The housing and the spring are a single component. In addition, it is recyclable since it is only made of polypropylene. It does not contain POM. The product catalogue offered by FSKorea is still substantial. Visitors were also able to appreciate a new dropper with metal ball applicator. The massage ball allows the product to be applied directly to the skin without using your hands. The coolness of the metal ball has a soothing effect on the skin. Note that the ergonomics of the set are adapted to wrinkles and scalp care. In the mascara segment, the company's flagship category, FSKorea also showcased a new super fine 2.5 mm brush designed to grab, lengthen and give volume to each eyelash naturally and effortlessly, even the smallest ones.

"""The future requires compromises,"" Clémence Droit, Qualipac","What is your job exactly ? Clémence Droit - My job starts when clients issue us with an invitation to tender for packaging. I oversee the full process with our sales team, from the tender right through to the delivery of the finished packaging. This includes quoting the price for each piece of packaging, the choice of material, the tint, and so on. What made you choose packaging as a career, and what excites you about the sector? Clémence Droit - I've always cared deeply about the environment, and I wanted to work at the source of the problem so I could fix it. My aim was to have a positive impact by pushing the clients and customers I worked with to make sustainable choices. I studied mechanical engineering with a specialty in plastics and composites processing. This led to my current position at Qualipac, where I work on developing and using packaging materials with a lower environmental impact. What are the packaging challenges that you want to overcome? Clémence Droit - Sustainability ! However, it's much more complicated than I expected. 'Sustainability' is a vague term that can cover a number of areas, and so it is often the case where we need to find a balance between the different needs and expectations of the suppliers such as Qualipac, our clients, the brands, and the final consumers. The perfect sustainable material does not always exist or can lead to more difficulties in the following processes. An alternative material may be more expensive, it might not have the required impact on emissions or recyclability, or it may not be viable from a time, cost, or quantity standpoint. This is where the need for balance comes in. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, especially when it comes to cosmetics. We need to adapt each packaging solution to the needs of its particular application, taking into account the product needs, consumer demands, market regulations, and so on. What is unique in your approach to packaging? How does it play an essential role in your company/the industry? Clémence Droit - When you are a woman in your twenties, ready to shake things up, it can be disturbing for others in a traditionally male-dominated industry. I am the only female project manager, working alongside people who have been there forever - 30 to 40 years in some cases. I break the mold, suggesting new ideas and new ways of thinking. My credibility and legitimacy can be challenged at times. For example, in the past, I have been told I did not look like a project manager or a mechanical engineer. As if mechanical engineering and femininity are not compatible. The more they tell me that, the more it drives me to show them it doesn't change the way I manage my projects, and it doesn't affect their quality. On the supplier side, my age and gender have influenced how I am treated, but on the brand side, we tend to deal with both men and women who have a more modern mindset. What do you see as the future of packaging? Clémence Droit - The future requires compromises between all stakeholders – suppliers, brands, and final consumers. In our industry, we care more about packaging than consumers do – consumers generally don't see all the small details and faults that I can pick out in a finished pack. In that sense, we, in the industry and brands, are the problem. If we want to make the world a better place with packaging, we need to stop being afraid and say, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"". Compromising your perfect vision means taking more time than you planned, getting out of your comfort zone, accepting smaller margins, and breaking the culture of overconsumption. What are you most proud of in your career so far? Clémence Droit - I work on multisite and multimaterial projects. It's great to combine the skills of each sites (plastic, glass, aluminium) to be able to offer clients the most sustainable solution, made with greener materials and processes, to limit our impact. In my previous work experience, I was working with a client wishing to reuse its waste into caps. Say they only used part of a flower for production of their skincare, they were looking to use the floral waste to make the cap for this product. What piece of advice would you share with young professionals out there looking to make an impact in packaging? Clémence Droit - Dare. If no one dares, we can't progress. Work at your own pace and don't be afraid to disrupt others. If you wear your values on your sleeve, people may not take the initiative themselves, but they can follow you. Make sure to seize any opportunities that present themselves – even if it's not always fun or comfortable in the short term. What does it mean to you to be selected as a Future Leader? Clémence Droit - I dared, and here I am! I'm delighted to represent the youth in this industry, and to be an agent of change for a sustainable future. I can't wait to meet people from different backgrounds who will bring unique ideas to the table."
Virospack perfects the dropper down to the smallest detail,"Specializing in the production of premium cosmetics droppers, Virospack has established its know-how in categories as varied as skin care, hair care, nail care and liquid makeup products. Headquartered in Badalona, in Barcelona's greater metropolitan area, the Virospack generates annual global sales of approximately EUR 60 million, with export sales representing more than 90% of the total, with its products being distributed to more than 20 countries across four continents. Founded in 1956, the company has recently become the property of investment company Investindustrial. At Luxe Pack Monaco, Virospack highlighted a fully plant-based dropper cap based on the Forewood material developed by German company Rezemo. The new 100% plant-based and compostable cap is part of a broader concept aiming at lowering the environmental footprint of droppers, which also included a bulb made with more than 50% biobased TPE and a pipette containing more than 40% of Eastman's biobased Tenite. The company also introduced to the market an innovative TPE-blown [1] injection technology to create unique shapes of bulbs. ""This new technology allows greater freedom for bulbs designing and customizing, being able to create a new consumer experience and exclusive brand positioning with special formats. These new personalized bulbs shapes, composed of different types of TPE available, can be combined with many options of caps and pipettes available in the Virospack dropper's portfolio and through different decoration finishes, such as colour painting or metallization, that will perfectly meet your brand needs,"" explains the company. There is also the possibility of having a completely recyclable dropper, using standard PP pipettes. Another innovation launched by Virospack is a new system offering an easier accurate dosage of the product. The new Duo Dose dropper system is suitable for a variety skincare formulation, such as lotions, creams, oils and serum, helping consumers to apply the amount adapted to their own beauty routine, thanks to a clear indicator in the push button, making it convenient to measure and dispense the required dosage of product 0,3 ml or 0,7 ml. With this more precise fixed dose, it is possible to customize the use of the product according to the type of skin (like oily or dry skin), period of application such as day or night, or even according to the climate or season of the year. As for other Virospack products, brands have the freedom and flexibility to personalize the decoration of this new dropper according to their specific design preferences."
"""Packaging needs to adapt,"" Anna Jayne Withey, Tangle Teezer","What made you choose packaging as a career, and what excites you about the sector? Anna Jayne Withey - I fell into packaging by accident, but I'm so happy I did. I used to be a freelance events photographer, but then Covid happened and changed my career direction completely. With no events to photograph, I found an intensive three-month graphic design course that was focused on getting students ready for industry. From there I got my internship at Tangle Teezer, which was a natural evolution for me. It's a wonderful, niche company which deals with a multitude of design needs from global branding to bespoke, premium customer requests. In particular, I love developing the bespoke pack designs for Sephora, both year round and themed for Christmas. More broadly, I'm excited by combining psychology with design strategy. I take huge satisfaction in evolving colour, typography and structure to influence consumer behaviour. Finding that link between understanding the broader societal needs of the consumer and translating this into packaging design. What are the packaging challenges that you want to overcome? Anna Jayne Withey - Sustainability is a must. Finding a way to make everything sustainable while also making it look exciting and premium is the challenge but a hugely important one. People will always want to buy product, which means we will always need to package it – packaging isn't something that's ever going to go away but it's something that needs to adapt to trends and societal changes. I worked on a bespoke Christmas project recently, and the brief outlined that it needed to feel special and stand-out. Specifically they wanted foiling, sparkles, and so on. From a manufacturing perspective it was complex as, glitter in particular, is not recyclable and can end up as micro-plastics in the ocean if disposed of incorrectly. I needed to hit the brief whilst also adhering to our sustainability targets so I found a solution by working with a supplier who uses a specific type of foil that is fully recyclable. In beauty, everything needs to be beautiful. You buy the whole thing – the product and the packaging. It needs to provide this experience while being considerate of our impact on the planet. What is unique in your approach to packaging? How does it play an essential role in your company/the industry? Anna Jayne Withey - I have a psychology degree, which sets me apart from most designers who have design-based degrees. My studies were all about consumer behaviour, so my approach is to give consumers what they want, and also what they don't know they want! It means I do a lot of trend forecasting, looking at both broad cultural events as well as aesthetic societal influences. Global issues like Covid and the economic crisis are hugely linked to consumer behaviour. During Covid, many consumers were more comfortable spending, but now they are more cautious due to the cost of living. So how do we encourage them to buy? They want something more functional now, getting more value from quality products that last longer. My role as designer is to communicate that through packaging design. Giving the consumer a sense of comfort and re-assurance whatever their concerns. What's going on in the world always determines how I design packaging – I am very much a strategic designer. What do you see as the future of packaging? Anna Jayne Withey - It's hard to say, because so much about the present is still so uncertain. Sustainability will definitely be enormous, and how we continue to improve our environmental footprint while still providing beautiful designs will be important. Naked, minimalistic or circular packaging is a trend I could see taking off. I think tech will also have a huge impact on packaging and how we create it and interact with it. That might involve QR codes with links to online portals, immersive VR experiences that the consumer can enjoy, or more AI-focused developments that support the supply chain. I think ultimately, packaging will become more about the end to end experience it offers consumers, the stories the packaging tells, whether by its history from recycling or its future by use of tech. What are you most proud of in your career so far? Anna Jayne Withey - Being chosen as a Future Leader is one of my career highlights, I can't lie! Apart from that, we did a Barbie collab, which meant I was able to meld two of my favourite childhood brands. When I saw strangers on the internet start fangirling about my design, commenting on the small details I put into the pack, it got me so excited! There's nothing more fulfilling that see something that you've poured your soul into give other people so much joy. What piece of advice would you share with young professionals out there looking to make an impact in packaging? Anna Jayne Withey - Think about what you're passionate about, and then apply it to packaging, whatever your role is in the design and development process. That means, when work is tough and your mood is low, there are still things that can fuel your soul. For me, it's colour and sustainability – I want people to see the product on the shelf and get excited but also be proud to purchase what I've designed, as it is good for the planet. What does it mean to you to be selected as a Future Leader? Anna Jayne Withey - It's the first accolade of my packaging career. I'm so honoured! How am I up there amongst all these amazing people? All the work I do, and pour my heart and soul into, is being recognised globally, and that's amazing. No words can express how happy I am! I'm just thankful to have a voice on this platform, where people can see and hear my ambitions and share my enthusiasm.

"""The future of packaging will be less plastic based,"" Manush Barvar, Brauzz","Manush Barvar, one of the co-founders of Brauzz, a brand of plastic-free cleaning products, has been named as one of the Future Leaders that will be put under the spotlights at Paris Packaging Week 2024. Can you introduce Brauzz to us? Manush Barvar - At Brauzz, we enable sustainable consumption by developing innovative products that do not compromise on quality, ease of use, or affordability. We do that by banning useless water transport in household and personal care products, using biodegradable ingredients, and eliminating disposable plastic. What made you choose packaging as a career, and what excites you about the sector? Manush Barvar - I wouldn't say that packaging per se is my career, but being in charge of product developments in a company that is all about reducing plastic waste and single-use packaging I am of course strongly involved in assessing and selecting between the various innovations the market has to offer. This requires an understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of different materials and form factors, in terms of ecology but also in terms of functionality, shelf-life, and cost. What are the packaging challenges that you want to overcome? Manush Barvar - In our industry hygroscopicity is a huge issue. The innovative detergent concentrates we offer are oftentimes very susceptible to humidity in the air. Finding sustainable packaging solutions that, at the same time, offer strong enough sealant layers and moisture barriers has proven to be a difficulty and remains one of the key packaging challenges we face today. But the market is moving fast, and we can already see more promising solutions today than when we first started a few years ago. What is the place of packaging in your business? Manush Barvar - Packaging plays a crucial role in our company because it directly aligns with our mission of sustainable consumption. It's not just about protecting our products; it's about ensuring that the packaging itself is environmentally responsible. We approach packaging as an enabler for our business model, which requires that all products need to fit through a letterbox. Through this, we can make sure that our customers do not need to be at home when receiving their products and therefore offer a high level of convenience. What do you see as the future of packaging? Manush Barvar - I believe that the future of packaging will be less plastic based. Fibre, cellulose, and other more innovative materials will be used. This will be the result of a mix of regulation and consumer behaviour. But if I had to summarise my view on the future of packaging it would be: ""less is more"". Products will get smaller and more efficiently packed, and the overall raw-material consumption will decrease. What are you most proud of in your career so far? Manush Barvar - We started with a vision of reducing plastic waste and single-use packaging, and we've been able to turn that vision into a reality. Seeing our innovative products on the market and knowing that they are helping to minimise environmental harm is incredibly rewarding. What piece of advice would you share with young professionals out there looking to make an impact in packaging? Manush Barvar - The packaging industry is evolving rapidly, and there are always new technologies and materials emerging. To stay on top of everything, it is crucial to connect with experts, attend industry events, and build relationships with like-minded individuals and organisations. What does it mean to you to be selected as a Future Leader? Manush Barvar - It signifies recognition of our efforts to make a positive impact in the packaging industry and the broader sustainability movement. It also means that we have a platform to inspire and influence positive change. I see it as a call to continue leading by example, driving innovation, and advocating for more sustainable practices in packaging.

Gerresheimer combines its glass jars with biosourced caps from Rezemo,"Gerresheimer and Rezemo have joined forces to create a range of bio-based closures that can be combined with endlessly recyclable glass containers. ""Both companies share a deep commitment to sustainability and eco-conscious manufacturing and design. By joining forces, we aim to further reduce the environmental footprint of primary packaging while providing customers with innovative and appealing solutions,"" highlights Stefan Rieder, Global Senior Vice President Commercial at Gerresheimer Moulded Glass. The new offer builds on the bio-based Forewood material, a combination of wood fibres and plant-based binders developed by Rezemo. According to Gerresheimer, this sustainable alternative to plastic and aluminium is perfectly suited to produce closures. It is not only environmentally friendly but also offers excellent performance characteristics. In addition, multiple design options in terms of surface structure or colour can be realized. ""The bio-based closures in combination with glass containers will appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. They are biodegradable, recyclable, and align with the global movement towards reducing single-use plastics,"" explains Stefan Zender, co-founder of Rezemo. ""We have developed a cutting-edge material consisting of wood fibres and biopolymers,"" further elaborates Julian Reitze, the second co-founder of Rezemo. As a first step, Gerresheimer's standard cosmetic packaging portfolio now entails a set of a 50ml glass jar with a Forewood closure, ideally suited e.g., for skincare products. Both the jar and the closure can be customized through decoration techniques or colour design."
How Good Filling's vending machines can help close the loop on waste,"What was your background before founding Good Filling? Petros Palandjian - I grew up in Massachusetts in the northeast United States but moved south to study computer science and economics in North Carolina. After I graduated, I started out in private equity, but I quickly realised that I wanted to leverage my skills and switch to something linked to sustainability. What is your business, and what does it do? Petros Palandjian - There was no business doing exactly what I felt was necessary to promote the circular economy, so I decided to start my own! I started by developing a bottle exchange service, but it was too time-intensive to rinse and sanitise returned bottles to the required standard. My idea was, instead, to enable consumers to reuse the packaging they already have. That led to the birth of Good Filling! Good Filling designs and provides vending machines that work like soda machines. Consumers bring their own containers and refill them with a product of their choice – whether that is surface cleaner, shampoo, or many other household staples. It's quick, clean, and cost-effective, making it easier for families to keep plastic packaging out of the waste stream. What made you choose packaging as a career, and what excites you about the sector? Petros Palandjian - Growing up in a large family, I was very aware of the amount of waste that households can generate. Learning about issues around recyclability and reusability was a formative experience for me, so I always made an effort to reduce the amount of waste I produced personally, which led to the founding of Good Filling. In that sense, I've always been interested in packaging. But I've also always loved labels, and the way they help brands express themselves through the different technologies and materials available. What are the packaging challenges that you want to overcome? Petros Palandjian - Solving the puzzle of reusability. The feeling you get when you open a pack is great, but it's gone quickly. But in many cases, that pack can persist in the environment for over 100 years. Reusing packaging is the only solution here. What is unique in your approach to packaging? Petros Palandjian - That we don't use any! We adopt a bring your own mentality – BYO. Consumers bring their empty packaging to the machine and refill it. We create a closed loop on the consumer side, but also on the supplier side, too. What do you see as the future of packaging? Petros Palandjian - Reusable packaging. Society needs packaging, but that packaging needs to stay in use for its lifetime. What are you most proud of in your career so far? Petros Palandjian - Founding a company that has the environmental impact that Good Filling does. It's impactful because it helps to reduce our reliance on single-use plastic, and in turn, our CO2 emissions. What piece of advice would you share with young professionals out there looking to make an impact in packaging? Petros Palandjian - Be mindful of materials. It is natural to want to serve market trends and be competitive, but sustainability needs to be taken into account. Think about the impact material usage has and consider its whole journey, from manufacturing to end-of-life. What does it mean to you to be selected as a Future Leader? Petros Palandjian - I'm very excited! It's cool to have the opportunity to meet with brands. I'm curious to meet with big brands who produce large volumes of packaging, and to talk about how a solution like ours could help them meet their environmental goals. Many countries in Europe are ahead of the US in terms of sustainability, so I look forward to networking with people who can inspire me!"
"Lumson showcases sustainable luxury beauty packaging, with a touch of fun","Thanks to the originality and elegance of its numerous standard models that are designed in-house, and to first-rate decoration capabilities, Lumson offers high-end turnkey solutions within short lead times, for minimum order quantities comprised between 5,000 and 10,000 pieces. At Luxe Pack Monaco, from October 2 to 3, 2023, Lumson presented two new shapes – named Excelsa and Sublima – completing its Techno Airless Glass (TAG) range of pouch airless pumps assembled on glass bottles. These new luxury bottles were designed for prestige skincare products and make-up. ""As far as beauty packaging is concerned, premiumisation and sustainability are concomitant trends,"" Cécile Pompili, Marketing Strategic Manager at Lumson, told Premium Beauty News. Also unveiled at Luxe Pack, the new Infinity range includes four glass bottles (from 15 ml to 50 ml) and a 50 ml refillable glass jar with a removable PP cup. For increase sustainability credentials, Infinity items can be all produced using post-consumer recycled (PCR) Glass. Last but not least, Lumson has expended its Eco Balānce range, which now features the Eco Dropper mono-material dropper and a jar with a new PP cover. The Eco Dropper is a coloured mono-material dropper that was designed to bring a breath of fresh air for this type of product, in addition to its environmental benefits. The components are made entirely of PP allowing to be easily declined in an original and coloured version. Of course, since these droppers are made of a single material, they can be easily recycled at the end of their life cycle. ""This does not compromise technical performance, however: Eco Dropper provides the same precision and ease of use as traditional droppers,"" claims Lumson. The collar and pipette are made of PP while the seal is made of polyolefin, a special elastomer compatible with the PP recycling chain. This solution simplifies end-of-life recycling, so that all the components can be processed along the same chain. The Eco Dropper can also be combined with PCR glass bottles for increased sustainability. To complete the range, Lumson has created a new 100% PP cover to replace the former PETG solution. The main challenge was not to compromise on the aesthetics for each of the three elements of the cover — outer/inner/sealing gasket – now only made of PP. The cover can be combined with Lumson's Slim 58-diameter and De Luxe 66-diameter jars in both standard and refillable versions. For an even greener approach, the components can be made of PCR PP. And once again, the use of PP allows the brand to add a touch of colourful cheerfulness to the packaging solution!"
"PharmaCos, Stoelzle Pharma's new packaging line for wellbeing products","Unveiled at the CPHI show, held in Barcelona from October 24 to 27, 2023, the PharmaCos line boasts a diverse range of glass jars, available in sizes ranging from 5 ml to 500 ml, all in amber with a screw neck design, as well as flat-shoulder bottles in capacities ranging from 20 ml to 150 ml, offered in both amber and flint glass.

Stoelzle Pharma's comprehensive one-stop-shop concept also includes decoration. Stoelzle provides over 20 different in-house decoration techniques, including screen printing, spraying, acid etching, and environmentally conscious options like eco-friendly ink developed from recycled rubber waste."
Lumson continues to expand its airless range with new designs,"Lumson's noteworthy innovations are never the end of the story, they always bring something new and innovative. One of these certainly is TAG – Techno Airless Glass, a true cornerstone in Lumson's history: not only it was the first airless system in a glass bottle to be launched on the market by the Italian company, but, over 10 years later, it remains ""The Original one"" thanks to the technology that was used to make it and it still represents a key source of inspiration for new products and new designs. TAG, has always been a synonym of AIRLESS TECHNOLOGY AND ELEGANCE EXPRESSED TO THE FULLEST, from the N19 version, which is the first and also the most classic of all Lumson's airless packaging, to DeLuxe shape, remarkable for its thick base, and finally Unique with its elegant, gentle and rounded curves. To complete range, two latest designs become part of the TAG family: EXCELSA and SUBLIMA. These new luxury bottles are designed for prestige skincare products and make-up. TAG EXCELSA and SUBLIMA outstand for their exclusive outlines, as one bottle with softer and more rounded lines while the other is highlighted by the notable diameter and height. Both designs catch the eye for the thick bottom and can be paired with Lumson's aluminum overshelled pumps as the fullest expression of elegance. As for the entire TAG family even the two new shapes will be both available in 15 – 30 – 50ml, whereas the related samples starting from November 2023. All the Lumson's TAG range is well-known for its top-quality airless technology that guarantees the maximum product protection, thanks to the single or multi-layered pouch studied to act as a barrier against external agents, for a complete SAFE BEAUTY. These outstanding solutions perfectly combine the technical and functional advantages of an airless systems without overlooking the aesthetic. Lumson has specifically studied and developed for the entire airless range a special inner lacquering decoration technique that perfectly highlight the outlines of the bottle and the thickness of the bottom for the absolute glass preciousness. Moreover the packaging can be totally customized playing with other decoration techniques for a remarkable result with unmistakable details. Not only is the entire airless range extremely technological and functional, but TAG's family is also sustainable. A journey started over 10 years ago with the first TAG version that even at that time it was already studied to respect the environment, and now more than ever that vision is perfectly aligned with the current one that sees sustainability as one of the main drivers when it comes to packaging's choice. Lumson's airless systems are designed to give the consumer a new approach both ethical and sustainable. After use, the consumer can easily separate the glass bottle from the plastic components and recycle each part appropriately. One technical system, many faceting, the LUMSON TAG range is certainly unmistakable!"
Elemis partners with Morro to create upcycled single-use sachets for cosmetics,"Elemis wants to upcycle their own left-over plant waste into bio-based film that will be the base of plastic-free single-use sachets for cosmetic products. To achieve this ambitious goal, the British skincare brand is building on Morro's expertise on plant-based materials. Created by Xampla, a clean technology start-up spin-out from the University of Cambridge, Morro materials are plant-based drop-in, high-performance replacements for plastics. The two companies hope that, within six months, their collaboration will yield heat-sealable films that can replace single-use plastics used in skincare samples. Elemis will then explore whether the innovation can be scaled and launched to consumers. ""What we find so exciting about this project with Morro is how utilising waste from left-over plant material can potentially tackle one of our key packaging dilemmas too. This project further reflects our commitment to finding new opportunities to have a positive impact on planet and people throughout our value chain,"" said Oriele Frank, Co-Founder, Chief Product and Sustainability Officer at Elemis. While Elemis is aiming for all of its packaging to be recyclable, reusable or biodegradable by 2025, sachets remain difficult to recycle. Indeed, this popular format for consumers and brands alike is often made from several layers of different materials, and is very light and may pose contamination issues. The project has been supported by a grant co-funded by Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), and Innovate UK. According to Xampla, more than half (54%) of UK adults see plastic as a ""material of the past"" and some 76% would prefer their products ""to come in natural, plastic free packaging that can be composted at home or taken by the council alongside food waste"". ""Our collaboration with Elemis unlocks significant potential for the cosmetics industry, where waste materials are transformed into innovative solutions to replace plastic sachets. We are proud to have pioneered our breakthrough material using plant feedstocks and we are looking forward to developing this research further with Elemis,"" commented Pete Hutton, Chairman of Xampla."
Aptar completes its airless ranges and reinvents the dropper experience,"Aptar continues its efforts to meet the new expectations of brands and consumers in terms of luxury beauty packaging. Among Aptar Beauty's major new launches at Luxe Pack's latest edition is the NeoDropper range designed to enhance consumers' dropper experience.Indeed, the line guarantees clean and precise application until the last drop thanks to a shorter applicator. Produced by Aptar in their Suzhou facility, in China, the new droppers are available in two versions: – NeoDropper Classic, with bulb, for dosage on demand – and NeoDropper Autoload, with a push- button, that automatically reloads a precise, predetermined dosage. Both Classic and Autoload feature a short applicator and spill-resistant technology, ensuring product is not wasted. In the airless segment, Aptar presented a mono-material version of their airless best-seller Micro 30 ml. Made entirely of polyethylene (PE), Mono Micro is easily recyclable. For an even better performance at recycling plants, Aptar partnered with Autajon Labels to create a seamlessly matching 100% PE label. The Mono series will be extended in 2024 with 50 ml and 75 ml mon-material versions of Mezzo. Also with the aim of expanding their range of sustainable airless solutions, Aptar Beauty partnered with Pinard Beauty Pack to create Future Airless PET, a large-size airless packaging solution that is both fully recyclable and omnichannel. The full recyclability is obtained through the combination of Aptar's Future PE pump, launched in 2021, and the patented airless PET bottle-in-bottle by Pinard. The full pack is also e-commerce capable, having passed the Amazon ISTA-6 protocol. Furthermore, the use of transparent PET gives the pack a entirely premium look. This solution, which will be produced in the EMEA region, with an estimated launch in Q2 2024, will be also available with a non-detachable tamper evident system."
Luxe Pack Monaco: perfume packaging has embraced a 360° ecodesign approach,"Initially focused on lightening glass bottles and increasing the share of recycled content, manufacturers have broadened their ecodesign strategies to primary and secondary packaging as a whole for a 360-degree approach. By working on refills, dispensing specialist Silgan adopted a strategy that is largely praised in the perfume sector. The company launched Replay, a new bottle-refill solution claimed to be seamless and adaptable to different neck sizes, from samples to travel, and even full sizes. The PP-based accessory is designed to be attached to the refill, so the user just unscrews the pump to insert the refill container. Then, they press it downwards to start refilling, and it automatically stops when the bottle is full. This new refill solution fitted with an overcap goes with the Pirouette screw pump range, a best-seller of the manufacturer. Bottle-refill pioneer Techniplast showcased a universal version of the RT Twist, an accessory also involving a screwing mechanism. This new launch offers a solution adapted to different bottle sizes. Dow, a manufacturer of Surlyn, an ionomer widely used for perfume and cosmetics caps, announced the launch of two new sustainable versions: Surlyn Ren, made from biowaste, like used cooking oil, and Surlyn Cir, made from mixed plastic waste. According to Dow, they both offer the same aesthetic and mechanic performance levels as the original material. The LVMH Beauty division will be one of the first to use these new materials for its 75 brands. Axilone announced they have been working on 100% aluminium-based perfume caps, which means they can be recycled through standard streams and can be used as an alternative to Zamak. And of course, for sustainable purposes, caps can also be made from glass, like that of Flower Ikebana by Kenzo, developed by the Pochet Group. As a full-service partner of beauty brands, the Superga group collaborated with the GBC formulation laboratory on an innovative range of alcohol-free perfumes called Neo Scents, based on the Aquaco technology brought by Expressions Parfumées. The three solutions put forward are meant to reinvent perfume gestures, create pleasure-of-use, and adapt products to on-the-go use, while offering a more natural composition. And it is a success: Neo Hair Mist is a perfumed hair mist, Neo Concrete is a scented wax between perfume and skincare, and Neo Perfume Stick is a non-oily, transparent stick based on light oils. It was the first time the Luxe Pack Monaco show had dedicated a whole area to the Home Fragrance segment, a fast-growing market and a springboard for innovations. Superga Beauty pursued its innovation strategy by developing Mood, a range of scented home products imagined in partnership with Expressions Parfumées. Involving a set of neuroscience-based technologies, these fragrances can have a positive influence on emotions. For example, the fragrance diffuser and the room spray were scented with the Ray of Sunshine perfume selected for its energizing benefits. Boasting a formula adapted to fabrics, the pillow mist diffuses the fragrance To the Moon & Back, designed to make it easier to fall asleep and enhance the quality of sleep. Also, Scentys, the company that developed the patented dry diffusion technology for perfumes encapsulated in polymer beads, showcased a version of its capsules based on a biosourced material. In addition, for a ""perfume discovery"" application in retail or through sampling, they innovated with a pod version of their technology. The small-sized item contains a few beads to perfectly reproduce the fragrance without emitting any other particles in the air. Prada has already adopted this solution in its stores. Actively committed to developing decoration solutions with a low environmental impact in collaboration with Quali Glass Coat, glassmaker Stoelzle Masnières Parfumerie now offers inside lacquering with a water-based spray. Inside lacquering makes it possible to coat the inside parts of bottles, guaranteeing full coverage and taking into account the bottle's volume and glass density. Despite direct contact with the juice poured inside, the lacquer's unique formula prevents any transfer, even with products containing alcohol, so no inner pouch is required. Trends and innovations in the global perfume market will be presented at the Fragrance Innovation Summit on 30 November 2023 in Paris. Details and registration: www.fragranceinnovation.com"
L'Occitane selects Albéa's recyclable tube for its 30 ml hand cream,"L'Occitane en Provence and Albéa Tubes add a new milestone to their cooperation with the relaunch of 30ml shea butter hand cream best seller. The all-plastic laminate and APR-certified Greenleaf solution with a multilayer sleeve in HDPE replaces the former Aluminum Barrier Laminate tube. The new solution reduces the number of materials from 5 to 2 and the components from 3 to 2. The transition from a laminated (ABL) tube to a Greenleaf tube integrating the OctoTop opening system enables now recyclability while reducing the overall weight of the tube by 23% compared to the current one. For the cap, L'Occitane relied on Albéa's EcoTop technology with OctoTop, a 2-in-1 flip-top closure system featuring the famous octagonal form iconic of l'Occitane and removing the peel seal. The closure system is in HDPE, making the whole tube recyclable in existing PE recycling streams in France, Europe and the United States. According to Albéa, this custom project required two years of co-development and is based on a certified life cycle analysis (LCA) assessing the environmental impact reduction of the new tube solution in several categories compared to the current one. ""In our CSR strategy, the reduction of the CO2 impact of our products is one of our main commitments, and we want to address it with innovations that make a real difference"", explains David Bayard, R&D Packaging Director at L'Occitane. ""Weight reduction and recyclability were therefore at the heart of this project and led us to simplify the tube as much as possible without compromising on esthetics and functionality. On the contrary, the OctoTop improves the tube's functionality for our customers."" ""L'Occitane did not hesitate to rethink and redesign its most iconic packaging to drive circularity forward, and we could not be prouder of this new milestone in our common journey,"" adds Isabelle Sery, Sales Director at Albéa Tubes. The tubes are produced for L'Occitane at the Albéa Argonne site, in France, and will be available on the market early next year."
Luxe Pack Monaco innovations: material-focused sustainability,"Given the environmental issues at stake and the regulations to come, the use of recycled and biosourced materials and the development of monomaterial packaging solutions in line with the circular economy principles were the main areas of packaging innovation in all segments. For example, as regards plastics, the use of recycled and upcycled materials was combined with the development of monomaterial solutions compatible with the main household waste recycling streams. Dow, the manufacturer of Surlyn, an ionomer used for perfumes and cosmetics jars and caps, announced the launch of two sustainable versions of its flagship material: Surlyn Ren, made from biowaste like used cooking oil, and Surlyn Cir, made from mixed plastic waste. These two ranges derived from alternative raw materials offer the same aesthetic and mechanic performance as the original material. The LVMH Beauty division will be one of the first to use them for its 75 brands. Aptar Beauty has continued to broaden its monomaterial offering, this time to airless packaging. The beauty packaging specialist showcased the Mono Micro, a new version of the 30-ml airless best-seller Micro, fully made of recyclable PE (label included, thanks to a collaboration with the Autajon company). In collaboration with Pinard Beauty Pack, Aptar also announced the launch of Future Airless PET, a combination of its e-commerce certified PE-based pump Future and of Pinard's patented PET-based airless bottle for a fully recyclable pack. As for Albéa, they unveiled Pure Drop, a dropper concept with a 100% PP-based push-button switch composed of only three parts. Even the pipette is made from PP, and it can be made transparent using PP Clear – a patent application has been submitted. Also, depending on the brand's choice, the bottle can be made of glass or plastic. The French manufacturer also completed the BreizhStick range launched last year. Made in Plouhinec, in Brittany, this monomaterial tube – four PP-based parts – designed for the lip care market now comes in two versions: Breizhstick Tilty, developed with a bevelled shape for specific applications, and Breizhstick Blunt, a new, flat-shaped one for standard applications. Combining ecodesign, customization, and consumer experience, Quadpack highlighted the ShapeUp Stick solution. This 12.5-ml stick can dispense formulas with a high viscosity by giving them any shape, depending on the brand's wishes: a logo, a symbol, or any other geometric pattern. ShapeUp Stick can be easily refilled and recycled, and the whole pack is made of monomaterial PP, while the cap and base can be PP-PCR-based. For its part, Cosmogen showcased a new range of 100% PET or RPET sticks, suitable for all types of wax and/or anhydrous formulas. In the field of premium promotional accessories, bags and paper, Rissmann imagined a prestigious bag based on FSC-certified flocked paper produced with eucalyptus pulp. The surface reveals a suede look and feel, and patterns obtained with a complementary embossing process create an animal coat visual and touch effect. For its boxes and sets, the Cosfibel company works on multiple mechanical closing solutions excluding any material other than cardboard for a monomaterial design, but also on organic cushion materials like mycelium, a compostable botanical material derived from a mushroom. As for Procos, they showcased Grace Box, a high-end patented set which, thanks to highly condensed, recycled brown cardboard, is highlighted as a lighter, more economical alternative to conventional boxes made from wood or grey cardboard, with the same thickness. Following its Plastic-to-Paper strategy, Fedrigoni, the leader of high-end paper for luxury packaging, broadened its Imitlin range with new versions. Originally designed for its similarities with noble materials, Imitlin is now upgraded with Diana, a new embossing solution reminiscent of hammered leather, new shades, elegant finishings, and a high-weight paper offering. DS Smith, a specialist of corrugated cardboard, unveiled an e-commerce shipping box solution developed in partnership with Guerlain. When they place an order online, consumers choose between the traditional, ""iconic"" case for the brand's full shopping experience, or a ""basic"" case, for a reduced environmental impact. The latter was designed and produced by DS Smith to combine attractiveness and a reduced environmental impact. Three sizes were developed to cover 90% of needs, with minimized empty spaces. It is also possible to integrate paper inside and crease it to better block the products, without any additional material. A noble material ideal for the green transition, thanks to its being infinitely recyclable in well-established streams, aluminium is available in different forms, from monomaterial to refillable designs. INCA Packaging, the Italian specialist of aluminium and plastic packaging, aims to meet the rising demand with a significant investment to enhance its processes. They will install a brand new water treatment system, reduce energy consumption by 50% and chemical products by 20%, and increase their capacity by 80%. In addition, the INCA teams have been working on product designs based on recycled aluminium (RE-AL), as well as on monomaterial or refillable solutions. The Italian manufacturer showcased a perfume bottle stopper free from any plastic insert and a cap for cream jars fully made of aluminium, with virgin aluminium outside and recycled aluminium inside, in percentages ranging from 50% to 75%. Ultimately, the INCA team has been working on an aluminium-based, 100% recyclable refill system for cream jars, and is looking to replace Zamak-based ballasts with an aluminium version. The g.pivaudran company, a specialist of metal transformation, in particular of aluminium for high-end packaging, has also been making investments to modernize its production tool after a record growth period of almost 50% of its turnover expected for 2023. A new automatic anodizing line operational in 2024 will help double its surface treatment capacity, while reducing water, energy, and chemicals consumption by a third. As an example of ecodesigned creation, the company showcased the result of the challenge it took up for Chanel: replacing the varnished, galvanized brass strip which used to decorate the Chance Eau de Toilette bottles with an anodized aluminium strip. Lastly, Axilone also banked on the full-aluminium strategy with a makeup range including a recyclable monomaterial lipstick. In addition, Axilone has been developing 100% aluminium-based perfume caps to be used as an alternative to Zamak, for example."
"Pochet highlights refillability, circularity and premiumization at Luxe Pack","At Luxe Pack Monaco, from October 2 to 4, 2023, in parallel with its most recent creations (a refillable skincare jar for Sublimage by Chanel, a glass bottle with a glass cap for Kenzo Flower Ikebana, an eye shadow compact case for Prada Dimensions, etc.), the Pochet Group showcased its vision of luxurious and sustainable beauty packaging. Besides the Odyssée (the refillable, nomadic jar) and Modulo Skin collections, Pochet showcased two new customizable refillable skincare jar designs: – Malti, a skincare jar that combines creative materials (wood, ceramic, aluminium, virtuous plastic, etc.) for its case or refill, and simplified refillability. – Marvelous, a refillable prestige skincare jar with intuitive gestures. The jar and refill are made of glass. ""Its hidden refillability means that it retains an elegant aesthetic, in keeping with the codes of exceptional skincare,"" said Pochet in a statement. In partnership with MagREEsource and its customers, the Pochet Group intends to integrate these responsible magnets into perfume caps. MagREEsource is developing an innovative technology for recycling magnets sourced in France from the dismantling of wind turbines and electric motors. ""This innovation will make it possible to divide the magnet's carbon footprint by 10, compared with a magnet manufactured in Asia,"" explains Nicolas Piffault, CSR Director for the Pochet Group. To meet the needs of make-up brands, a market that is premiumizing at fast pace, Pochet noble materials and innovative gestures. Among the new products presented at Luxe Pack Monaco: – Diamond, a bottle with glass base and cap that offers an entirely translucent packaging adding radiance to make-up and skincare formulas, as well as perfume juices. The innovation responds to the trend for ultra-luxury precious cases and can be recycled through the main recycling channels. – Minimal, a range of glass and aluminium products for skincare and make-up. Initially comprising a lightweight glass jar and an aluminium cap — the two materials most frequently recycled – the range has been expanded, with an ultra-light bottle (15g, i.e. 50% less weight than standard bottles on the market), with very thin glass walls, and a refillable glass case, ideal for loose powders and poured formulas as well as skin care creams. Jars in the Minimal range are available in all sizes, from 7ml blushes and balms to 200ml body creams. They are at least 20% lighter than the average weight of products on the market. – Audace, an all-metal or all-plastic range of compact cases with an easy opening and refill system for prestige powders. Please note: Nicolas Piffault, CSR Director and Laëtitia Reille, Strategic Marketing Manager of the Pochet Group, will present the group's multi-material approach for the creation of sustainable luxury packaging, during the next Fragrance Innovation Summit, on November 30 in Paris."
Recyclability and refillability: Cosmogen strengthens its offer,"Cosmogen builds on its pillars and modernizes its ranges of beauty applicators to better stick to the latest trends and meet sustainability expectations. At this year's Luxe Pack, Cosmogen showcased a new range of 100% PET or RPET sticks, suited for all types of wax and/or anhydrous formulas. Offering round or square sections, variable diameters and heights, with a capacity of 3.7g, this fully customizable collection of mono-material tubes can be used for lipsticks, concealers, or sun creams. With its modern and original design, its removable tip, replaceable on a refill and separable at the end of its life, its patented on/off closing system allowing distribution (on), application and cleaning (off), the new Squeeze 'n Fresh Removable is part of Cosmogen's sustainability approach. The tube and cap are available in recycled plastic. In line with the trend for metal applicators, Cosmogen has developed a comprehensive collection of 316L stainless steel massage accessories to keep (or not) in the refrigerator - for restorative massages thanks to the benefits of cold. With its asymmetrical and soft shapes and contours the guasha can be used intuitively on the face or body to provide sensations of well-being. In addition, three mini-massagers Curvy, Tam Tam and Cocktail each provide different sensations. New stainless steel versions are also available for Roller and Fresh Flex applicators. In line with its quest for circularity, Cosmogen has re-imagined its 100% PET mono-material rBRUSH, without glue, without ferrule. With this new design, Cosmogen aims to be a source of inspiration for brands to appropriate this concept, while personalizing it with textured handles or specific tufts shapes, in their image. The concept has also been adapted into a 100% RPET kabuki. Eventually, Cosmogen has introduced three targeted brush sets– for optimized advice at the point of sale. Each set, available in a FSC paper box, has been designed to meet a specific need and each brush – fibre, silicone, metal – has its specific use."
Albéa Tubes at Luxe Pack Monaco: Decoration and reduction in the spotlight,"While increasing the sustainability of packaging, through the reduction of their carbon footprint and more circular designs, remains essential, Albéa also intends to help brands to continue to differentiate themselves and offer consumers a renewed purchasing experience. Differentiation and reduction At this year's Luxe Pack Monaco, which was held from October 2 to 4, 2023 at the Grimaldi Forum, the tubes division of the French beauty packaging giant highlighted new decoration solutions and new solutions for reducing the weight of packaging for improved customer experience and enhanced sustainability. Thanks to their new NovaPrint printing technology, Albéa Tubes aims to offer the possibility of multiple decoration effects to reach outstanding tube packaging. According to Albéa, by welding a PE film on an extruded tube, NovaPrint offers photographic quality resolution, with high-quality images and 360° printing, without side seam. In addition to its ability to attract the attention of consumers, this new decoration technique also makes it possible to do without a cardboard box and also without a label: an important step towards the reduction and optimal recyclability of packaging. It also makes it possible to increase the content of tubes in post-consumer recycled materials (PCR) without compromising on their aesthetic qualities. Along the same lines, the PrimePrint solution allows direct printing on a cylindrical extruded tube, with photo-realistic results, highly coloured and high resolution pictures, clear and delicate details and smooth gradients. ""We are convinced that decoration will play a key role in the future,"" explains Caroline Hughes, Marketing Manager Albéa Tubes. ""Besides our NovaPrint technology, we are developing a wide roadmap of decoration options integrating several effects such as 3D as consumers are looking for new tactile and sensorial experiences. The result will be twofold: it will support brand's differentiation and, at the same time, enable the removal of secondary packaging - key to reduce waste - while ensuring the same attractivity for consumers"". Albéa continues to move forward with its packaging weight reduction roadmap and extends its range of EcoTop solutions with a new 35mm diameter to suit with face or hand care applications. Until now, the EcoFusion Top tube launched in 2022 — the fusion of the head and the cap — was only available in 50 mm diameter. Custom developments are also ongoing, all aiming at reducing the weight of the tube packaging. ""EcoTop is a forward-looking innovation in the packaging industry and the solution for the future to drastically reduce plastic"", highlights Caroline Hughes. Despite macroeconomic uncertainties, Albéa Tubes considers the move towards low impact tubes is a priority. The manufacturer has invested in new capacities to manufacture light weighted tubes for the beauty market and strengthened its commitments with its suppliers of PCR materials and its proximity with recyclers to ensure the circularity of its tubes. With the ambition to produce 100% recyclable tubes by 2025, Albéa has reached a proportion of 55% in 2022. Despite a good trend in Europe, the manufacturer considers there is a need to accelerate the market conversion to sustainable solutions by exiting from non recyclable Aluminium Barrier Laminate (ABL) tubes and by promoting PCR solutions on extruded and laminate tubes. While the aim is to reach 10% of PCR content in tubes by 2025, the proportion was of 2,4% in 2022. According to Albéa, this is due to the reluctance of toothpaste makers (50% of the cosmetic tubes market) to make the shift toward post-consumer recycled material."
Aptar Beauty and Quadpack revamp refillable lipstick encased in wood,"Launched one year ago, the Iconic Woodacity refillable lipstick will soon be available in 2.0 version, which will be presented at Luxe Pack Monaco, from October 2 to 4, 2023. Designed for increased sustainability and an engaging consumer experience, bringing together the two companies' expertise in lipsticks and wooden componentry, Iconic Woodacity features Aptar's Iconic mechanism, wrapped in a custom monomaterial wooden casing from Quadpack. The new edition refines the concept with more choice in wood types and finishes and a new, patented closure system called 'Solo Snap'. The Iconic Woodacity 2.0 casing can now be made of 100% ash or maple wood, sourced from European, sustainably-managed forests, with PEFC and FSC certifications. It is a canvas for brands, as they can make it their own by applying a wide array of designs and decoration techniques. ""Wood is all about emotions. Ash is a light-coloured wood with a straight grain. Maple can be very smooth and shiny. Decoration can either highlight the unique grain patterns or give the product a premium look-and-feel – in that sense, it can also cater to brands looking for sustainable packaging without wood's natural aesthetics,"" explained Denisa Stircea, Senior Category Lead at Quadpack. Quadpack's wood experts have created a click closure, thanks to a new, patented interior structure that works without inserts, plastic or otherwise. Consumers simply pull the cap off and push it back on until it clicks. According to Quadpack, the new Solo Snap system works perfectly with standard filling lines. The wooden casing houses Aptar Beauty's Iconic mechanism. POM-free, glue-free and lubricant-free, it offers a smooth actuation of the bullet. Refills are easily replaced by pulling out the used mechanism and snapping in the new one. With the mechanisms manufactured at Aptar Beauty's Chavanod facility in France and the casing made at Quadpack Wood in Catalonia, Spain, Iconic Woodacity 2.0 is entirely 'Made in Europe'. Iconic Woodacity 2.0 is the latest addition to Quadpack's Woodacity collection, which now includes lipsticks, compacts, jars and closures for perfume bottles, lotion packs and tubes. ""We are very proud to have built a collection of Woodacity solutions for almost every packaging need over the past two years. Part of the motivation to create Woodacity was to optimise the end-of-life solution for wood as best as we could – and that is exactly what we have achieved. Woodacity is all-natural, non-toxic and looks 100% premium – it's impossible not to fall in love with it! Plus, our original caps remain the best technology available for full-wood closure systems,"" concluded Denisa Stircea."
Faca Packaging to introduce new airless dispenser at Luxe Pack Monaco 2023,"Faca Packaging's 30ml new airless dispenser has been designed to meet the requirements of brands with delicate skincare formulations that need specific protection against environmental contamination. The interior, consisting of a shrink-wrapped bag, guarantees that the cream and air never come into contact. As the formula does not come in contact with air it is protected from oxidization and degradation risks. This helps to extend the shelf life of fragile formulations and ensures that they remain fresh and effective. The airless packaging also prevents direct contact between the product and external contaminants, such as bacteria and dirt. ""The great advantage of this design compared to most others on the market which are based on a lifting cylinder, is that it ensures the absence of air, has a simpler and more reliable mechanism and ensures practically complete emptying,"" said Faca Packaging in a statement. Indeed, the new packaging dispenses a consistent and controlled amount of product until the last drop, thanks to a precise pump mechanism. The packaging solution thus helps to prevent waste and improve customer satisfaction. ""This is especially important for expensive or high-value skincare products,"" the manufacturer added. Faca's new airless packaging can be customized to meet the specific needs of a brand. This includes the ability to choose the colour, material of the packaging to match the brand's identity. The outer dispenser is available in a variety of colours and materials including recycled PET or PMMA. Faca Packaging will showcased the new airless packaging at Luxe Pack from 02-04 October 2023, at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco."
"""Pochet Group creates the future premium and sustainable beauty packaging""","Premium Beauty News - The Pochet Group has just celebrated its 400th anniversary. Could you take stock of these events? Xavier Gagey - It was an exceptional year filled with celebrations on all our sites. It helped gather all our employees, both current and retired, the shareholding family members, as well as our customers, suppliers, the authorities, our partners, etc. We definitely wanted to celebrate our history and the group's exceptional longevity. This anniversary was an opportunity to reunite all teams and have them focus on a shared project: that was a key point after the Qualipac sell-off project. Also, it helped us strengthen our historic relationships with our customers, who were able to (re)discover the Group, its history and creations. Our history is also theirs. Premium Beauty News - What are your targets for the years to come? Xavier Gagey - Our 400th anniversary is a great opportunity to resolutely look to the future from a sustainable perspective. This is actually part of a strategic plan we have defined until 2026, with the clear objective shared by our teams to be the key, long-lasting partner of the beauty industry. It represents an investment of 160 million euros in four years for the whole group, and it is structured around three pillars: be a responsible player for both humans and the planet, a value-provider through our performance, and a premium solution creator for our customers, in particular thanks to our unique expertise in multi-materials, innovative partnerships, and trading. Premium Beauty News - Let us talk about the first pillar. What has been provided for regarding sustainability and decarbonation? Xavier Gagey - Driven by the shareholding family's strong beliefs, the Pochet Group has long committed to a CSR approach integrating both climate and social issues at its core. Now, we have been redefining our roadmap for 2023-2030, the details of which will be presented at the next Luxe Pack Monaco show. We have put a strong emphasis on decarbonation to reduce our CO2 emissions by 50% by 2033. This decarbonation plan involves many projects: for example, our first oven will be 100% electric as soon as late 2024. It will be the first electric oven for luxury bottling in France. There is also our measuring tool to monitor our energy consumption per item, as part of the Metron project in partnership with Chanel. It is the first time we have given our teams the means to act in real time, on each item, to reduce our plants' energy consumption. In addition, we will support our customers in speeding up project development with virtuous plastics. It is also worth noting that women and men are at the core of this CSR strategy. We have put an emphasis on this objective by investing over 10 million euros to enhance sorting stations ergonomics, helping to guarantee our employees their jobs, in optimum conditions. Premium Beauty News - As part of your decarbonation commitments, do you think you will be able to reduce your waste share? Xavier Gagey - The Pochet Group is an expert at maintaining excellent glass quality and extremely high quality requirements, while working on reducing waste production through digitalization. Three years ago, we started to implement an Artificial Intelligence tool in our glassmaking plant to better control our processes and product quality. Today's tools make it possible to reduce waste levels without affecting quality. Our customers are looking to premiumize their packaging as part of their sustainability strategies. So, our mission consists in supporting them in fulfilling these objectives, while enhancing our product quality. Premium Beauty News - Is the expectation for very high-end products related to the third pillar you were talking about, i.e. to create premium solutions? Xavier Gagey - Indeed, our customers expect us to support them with their strategic launches and in reaching their sustainable development objectives. We create both innovative and premium solutions, as our latest launches show, like Fame by Rabanne and the new Prada Beauty makeup line. These examples perfectly illustrate what the Group can provide, on the one hand, with the multi-material, glass, decoration, aluminium, and plastic offering. This expertise is really unique, and we keep enhancing it by strengthening the bonds between our innovation and sales teams. On the other hand, our trading solution is meant to broaden the group's capacity by offering new technological capabilities, thanks to our partners. Lastly, we have been building partnerships with our ecosystem, for example with MagREESource, who have developed an innovative technology to recycle magnets sourced in France. This will significantly reduce our carbon footprint, while preserving luxury codes. Premium Beauty News - The Pochet company has been part of the French heritage for four centuries. Have you considered developing production outside France? Xavier Gagey - Producing in France is a strength in our professions. When it comes to supply chain agility and carbon impact, being close to our customers is a significant competitive asset. And this advantage is all the more important given the geopolitical risks our customers increasingly integrate to their supply securing plans. We are present in Brazil and China for metals and plastics, and we are still open to new opportunities to support our customers' growth. Premium Beauty News - How do you think the market will evolve? Xavier Gagey - Just like our customers, I trust the beauty market will do well in the future, because the recent growth observed on the premium perfume market should be long-lasting, in particular thanks to Asia. Still, after two exceptional years, it will probably slow down, because our customers have replenished stocks. The beauty market is definitely changing, as customers are getting increasingly demanding. For the Pochet Group, this phenomenon is a great opportunity to highlight its assets and fulfil its objective to be a long-lasting, key partner of the Beauty industry."
Packaging sustainability: Technicaps broadens premium offering,"Specialized in designing solutions based on the transformation of thermosetting resins, like bakelite, for luxury spirits, cosmetics and perfume caps or jars, Technicaps started to diversify its industrial techniques three years ago. ""We aimed to diversify our businesses, while keeping in line with our values, and make technological and industrial choices involving meaningful materials for our customers, for us, and for the planet. We want it to be a long-lasting investment over time,"" explains Arnaud Revel, President of Technicaps. The investment will help support two additional businesses related to the company's original know-how: thermosetting resin compression. ""We still believe this technology has a bright future ahead. It helps make products that do not lose their shape over time, which means they can be reused,"" he adds. Technicaps has actually been studying the potential of alternative materials. An R&D team was set up with a PhD in materials, who screens all materials to check their viability in an industrial context. The company also banks on a new injection unit for technical, mono-material capping parts with thick walls. ""We wanted to meet the rising demand for technical products, including mono-material caps with thick walls. We can inject materials based on cellulose, like Sulapac, or PETs that can be massified with existing recycling systems,"" explains Arnaud Revel. The first products will be launched in 2024. Lastly, to complete its diversification, the company has been enhancing its skills regarding moulded cellulose thermoforming, both for primary and secondary packaging. Technicaps will showcase the first refillable glass jar with a cup made from moulded cellulose at the next Luxe Pack Monaco show. ""We are the first to offer this product with a standard mould. Our cellulose is made in France, sourced 300 km from our plant, and it is a natural, renewable, abundant, and recyclable material. Right now, there is a plastic film in infinitesimal quantity which protects the bulk material without jeopardizing recycling, but we are hoping to eventually use 100% cellulose,"" says the President. Boasting a turnover of 20 million euros for 110 employees, the company, positioned on the luxury sector, has achieved a 40% growth over the past three years. ""It is a fast-moving world for companies. It is no longer workable over time to keep a strategy based on a single technology. That is why we diversified our businesses, providing our customers with more content. But our core value remains the same: maintain a long-term, sustainable strategy,"" concludes Arnaud Revel."
Investindustrial acquires majority stake in dropper specialist Virospack,"Investment company Investindustrial is to acquire a 51% stake in Virospack, a manufacturer of premium cosmetics droppers. Headquartered in Badalona, Barcelona's metropolitan area, Virospack develops and manufactures droppers for skin, hair and nails care products and liquid make-up products. Founded in 1956, the company generates annual global sales of approximately EUR 60 million, with export sales representing more than 90% of the total, with its products being distributed to more than 20 countries across four continents. In the past 10 years, Virospack has invested approximately EUR 60 million to build additional manufacturing capacity in a 21,000 sqm complex in Barcelona. Virospack is currently undertaking a further significant expansion of its facility to increase its manufacturing area by more than 50% over the next three years. In addition, Virospack is advancing its sustainability programme encompassing circular economy concepts in the design and production of their products alongside its customers. Led by Executive Chairman Vicens Rodriguez, son of the founder, Virospack manufactures over 120 million droppers and spatulas and more than 20 million bottles annually and employs almost 400 people. ""I am delighted to partner with Investindustrial who is investing in our business to create further opportunities for expansion and to provide the right level of support to help us achieve further growth. Investindustrial has an excellent reputation for its stewardship and its ability to help companies scale and internationalise, and I am excited about working with them,"" said Vicens Rodriguez in a statement. ""Virospack is unquestionably a market leader, renowned for the quality of its products and the strength of its relationships with its highly regarded global leading cosmetics clients. We have been impressed by the team and its operations and are excited about Virospack's growth potential in the coming years. We are really looking forward to working with the Rodriguez family and the wider management team to continue Virospack's growth,"" added Andrea C. Bonomi, Chairman of the Industrial Advisory Board at Investindustrial. This transaction, which is subject to customary approvals, builds on Investindustrial Group's track record in the specialty packaging sector following its investment in Guala Closures, a manufacturer of aluminium high-end closures for the beverage industry with revenues of more than EUR 900 million."
Metapack unveils new targets for more sustainable luxury products,"Supported by a few China-based partner-manufacturers, Annette Der Minassian, Isaure de La Noue and Vahé Der Minassian founded Metapack in August 1998 as a company specialized in promotional items. ""Initially, we mainly aimed to offer made-in-China, Zamak-based specialized promotional items, but we soon started to work for the perfume industry, with a first perfume cap made from Zamak for Rochas. Then, we made the brass strip of the Chance fragrance by Chanel, for whom we have become a referenced supplier"", says Isaure de La Noue. The co-founder and Sales Director explains this fast move towards the luxury industry by the close, faithful relationship they built with their carefully selected Chinese partners. ""We wanted to work hand in hand with the plants in China. We formed a team there, composed of engineers, quality managers, and logisticians. We trained them to the processes our customers expected, and we helped them with capacity investments, whenever it was needed. We are not traders. We have always worked with a robust industrial base to be able to offer the best technical and economic solution, which should also be viable, production-wise"", she says. Now, Metapack works with a network of four plants specialized in Zamak injection, polishing and plating, and regularly upgraded to comply with environmental standards. But the company also adapts to the changing demand: new production avenues have been focused on Europe, with Zamak-specialized plants in Italy, especially for brands wishing to put forward a made-in-Europe claim. If Metapack developed various specialisms over the years, adding different metals like brass, steel, aluminium, and processes including leather casing, Zamak remains its flagship material. ""Zamak has become very popular over the past 25 years. It provides a luxury touch with its weight and cold feel. It can also be moulded like plastic, and it creates complex shapes. It can be plated, lacquered... Also, it is a material that can definitely find its own place in a sustainable project"", says Isaure de La Noue. The specialist actually promotes Zamak's circularity, because it can be recycled, like aluminium – provided it is sorted out. ""It is our hobby horse, in a way. We worked with Veolia and Derichebourg to check its recyclability on site. And it is easy to sort out: we actually tracked our products and got a potential recycling rate of 90%. Plus, it is definitely adapted to refill and luxury projects. It helps create beautiful objects that can be kept for years, like the powder compact made forLa Bouche Rouge, or our latest Fara Homidi launch"", she adds. Driven by its momentum, Metapack now aims to pursue its development in the perfume industry, which already accounts for 75% of its turnover, while exploring new territories, including home and spirits. The company made a set comprising a snuffer and a wick trimmer made from Zamak for Jo Malone, as well as candle-related accessories for Diptyque. Lastly, to support its Parisian teams at the company's headquarters and its Hong Kong collaborators, Metapack has been considering reopening the NYC offices that had been closed during the pandemic. This could be done in the months to come."
How is Coverpla driving the packaging market for indie perfume brands?,"In the heights of Nice, in an exceptional setting above the Parc du Vinaigrier, close to the Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur, is the key to the success of Coverpla, the French specialist in customised premium packaging. Bathed in Mediterranean sunshine, the historic premises and production lines are undergoing a complete overhaul! ""Since 2022, we have been investing heavily in modernising our site and our industrial facilities,"" explains Bruno Diépois, CEO of the company he bought in 2010. Coverpla is much more than a distributor of standard primary packaging. ""We operate according to an original model, which consists of having a large stock of high-quality components - glass bottles and jars, caps and pumps - which we pick and choose from to meet our customers' requirements. We then proceed with the decoration and all the customisation stages,"" continues the CEO. It's a bold strategy, as it involves significant capital investment, but on the whole, it provides a remarkable degree of agility, ensuring that orders ranging from a few dozen units to tens of thousands or more can be processed to very tight deadlines and high-quality standards. Although Coverpla creates many of its designs, the manufacture of glass bottles and jars is outsourced to European manufacturers [1]. Perfume caps, on the other hand, are mostly produced in-house, (95%) mostly from Surlyn. Models in zamak and wood are sourced via specialised partners, while the injection workshop tests different bio-sourced resins. In addition to extensive warehousing activities, the Nice site houses three industrial units: cap injection; decoration (screen printing, pad printing, hot stamping); and assembly (cutting and fitting of pumps and metal covers for the caps). The production of 6 and 7 million parts a year (for a capacity of 8 million) today accounts for 30% of the company's sales. Current investments (€1.2 m over the next three years) are aimed at streamlining flows in the various workshops and modernising the equipment. Coverpla boasts a catalogue of 156 families of glass bottles [2] and jars and around 130 cap designs, of which around a hundred are exclusive. This vast range gives customers a dual power of personalisation, based on almost infinite mix & match possibilities and multiple decoration options. This flexibility allows brands to create unique packaging that reflects their identity and vision, even for small quantities. Bottle and cap designs are created in-house, with all teams participating. For their decoration, Coverpla has six screen-printing lines capable of working on glass, aluminium, Surlyn, zamak or wood. Semi-automatic lines are used to process small and medium-sized runs, while an automatic line processes orders of more than 10,000 units or multi-passes. Thanks to its assembly capabilities, Coverpla can also customise the dip tubes of crimped pumps to suit the bottle format. Screw pumps are delivered pre-assembled with standard tubes that are resized to order. Coverpla has also won over its customers by placing sustainability at the heart of its strategic approach. The company has reduced its electricity consumption by investing in new, more efficient machines, and is aiming to make its activities carbon-neutral by 2025. This will be achieved through the purchase of green electricity and compensatory measures. The installation of photovoltaic panels, which could supply 15-20% of the electricity used on the site, is also under consideration. On the product side, in addition to developing lightweight glass bottles, Coverpla's technical expertise in Surlyn has enabled the company to incorporate a percentage of recycled PIR material in all its caps, without compromising on quality. The company is also exploring the use of sustainable materials, such as Sulapac or Natureplast. As far as decoration is concerned, enamels are gradually being phased out in favour of organic inks and UV-curing inks, which are less harmful and use less energy. Generally speaking, the company is constantly evaluating new technological options. These strategic investments have enabled Coverpla to establish itself as the leader in packaging for perfume indie brands in France, which remains its core market, accounting for 35% of sales. However, the company has also significantly expanded its international footprint, with subsidiaries in the US and Italy and a widespread network of distributors. In 2016, the creation of Coverpla Inc. strengthened the company's position in the US market, after several years of intensive commercial presence. Less driven by the fragrance category and more focused on trading, the business of the New Jersey-based subsidiary is growing strongly. Coverpla Inc. has its own stock and performs customisation operations on a sub-contracting basis. However, there are plans to bring the business in-house, possibly through an acquisition. With sales growing rapidly, and expected to reach more than €26 m in 2023, Coverpla is looking to the future with confidence. ""We are evaluating the possibility of an acquisition in the injection or decoration sector, in North America or Europe,"" says Bruno Diépois."
"Gerresheimer: ""Sustainability is integrated in all our processes""","Premium Beauty News - As an introduction, can you provide us with an overview of the beauty packaging division within Gerresheimer? Nicola Balena - Gerresheimer produces plastic and glass packaging, as well as drug delivery systems. We are one of the leading global packaging solution partners for the pharma, biotech, healthcare and cosmetic markets. We produce in 36 plants in 16 countries and employ more than 11.000 people worldwide. Solutions for the cosmetics market contribute around 12% to Gerresheimer's global revenue of EUR 1.82 billion in 2022. All in all, this represents a production volume of more than 1 billion pieces annually. We have three main factories dedicated to the cosmetics and personal care markets: moulded glass in Momignies (Belgium) and Tettau (Germany) and plastic packaging in Zaragoza (Spain). The three factories, which all include decoration facilities, employ more than 1.500 people. Being part of such a big group allowed us to intensively leverage synergies across all the different business units. We are profiting from our global footprint and our expertise in multiple technologies to meet the needs of our customers with a large array of solutions. This is the case, for instance, for tubular glass or droppers. Premium Beauty News - Sustainability is now a staple requirement for the packaging industry, how does Gerresheimer address this issue? Patrick Kraft - Sustainability needs to be integrated holistically and systematically in all of our business process. We therefore established a sustainability council at group level with the aim to set up a comprehensive strategy targeting all aspects that we can directly influence. Our sustainability strategy comprises three pillars: Gx Pure, which focuses on the environment, mainly on decarbonization and renewable energy; Gx Circular, which focuses on resources and materials, in particular the integration of ecodesign principles; and Gx Care focusing on our people. Of course, this comes with quantitative, measurable and transparent targets for each category. Our first focus is on decarbonization, for which we committed ourselves to a 50%-reduction of CO2 emissions by 2030 in comparison to 2019. The second main target is eco-design. Since 2023 all of our new product developments incorporate eco-design principles. Premium Beauty News - As far as glass is concerned, what specific initiatives have you implemented to reach these targets? Nicola Balena - In practice, these general targets are cascaded into the entire company and beyond, from supply chain to product development, glass production and logistics. Using PCR glass was one of our first initiatives. During the glass manufacturing process, using 1 ton of PCR saves the extraction of 1.2 tons of virgin raw materials and the energy consumption in the furnace is approximately 2.5% less for every 10% more cullet added. We have a long experience in including high PCR glass rates of up to 40% in our production, both in Momignies and Tettau, and it has enabled us to push the limits of recycled content in cosmetics glass packaging. Patrick Kraft - Actually, PCR glass is so useful that high collection rates should be a priority for public policies. While certain European countries have reached almost 100% collection rates for glass, this is far from being the case in many other countries, and this even worse outside Europe. Nicola Balena - Our second focus is on light weight glass. We are using advanced computer simulation tools to optimize the weight and product design. We have several lightweight standards in our portfolio, e.g. a 60g 50ml jar made from 40% PCR glass, or a 30 ml serum bottle matching our dropper. Furthermore, we are promoting tubular glass in cosmetics, which is a savvy way to create lightweight products. For instance, we are developing ultralight refill system inserts made from tubular glass. Lightweight and PCR are included into our 360° eco-design guidelines, according to which every project is screened and assessed. Patrick Kraft - We also have to consider the glass production process itself, in which melting is by far the most energy and CO2 intensive step. To date, there are basically two major options to address this issue: the first one is electrification, which is the more mature low carbon technology, the second is the use of renewable fuels, including green hydrogen. We have established a roadmap to transfer our entire furnace portfolio systemically towards low carbon glass melting solutions. In summer 2022, we have started a new hybrid melter in Tettau that enables the use of up to 50% renewable electricity. It completes our all-electric furnace in Momignies, Belgium. We are also building a power station comprising 12,000 m2 solar panels in Momignies to enable the use of locally produced renewable energy on site. Premium Beauty News - How does Gerresheimer collaborate with customers to develop sustainable packaging solutions? Nicola Balena - Collaboration between providers of packaging solutions and their customers is a key factor for success when it comes to sustainability. A continuous dialogue and constant exchange are needed to avoid potentially negative impacts of good intentions, such as a decrease in production efficiency that would generate more waste, for instance. Patrick Kraft - It is also important to consider that glass production is a heavy industry where sustainability needs strategic planning! And this cannot be done by one company alone. Cross-company collaboration with customers is crucial. That's why we are keen and willing on developing joint decarbonization roadmaps together with our customers. Nicola Balena - The world is changing, with young generations adopting new ways of thinking! With the consequences of climate change being increasingly perceptible in our everyday life, sustainability has become one of today's main concerns of the consumers. They want to contribute in a positive way but many of them also think that manufacturers and governments must lead the way. We take our responsibility seriously and integrate environmental considerations in all our business decisions, with the aim to support our customers in their endeavour to provide more sustainable products to to consumers."
"Rissmann banks on the advantages of ""Made in Europe"" boxes and packaging","Now a key player in custom-made premium cardboard packaging (paper carrier bags, folding cartons and rigid boxes), the company founded in Germany in 1855 had a purely family destiny until it was acquired in 2016 by vph GmbH & Co, a major German paper merchant and member of the IGEPA Group. Since then, Rissmann has worked to consolidate its market position with a focus on automation and sustainability, resulting in rapid sales growth to EUR 60 million in 2022, almost doubling the 2019 figure. To maintain this sustained pace, the company intends to build on its reputation for quality, substantial investment in automation and digitisation of its design and production processes, and growing demand for made-in-Europe solutions. ""Producing in Europe is increasingly seen by our customers as a major asset, with even the largest groups who keep a very close eye on their budgets looking to diversify and shorten their supply chains,"" explains Sophie Ivens, CEO of the company since 2020. ""We have built a strategy on this basis, relying on the trust of our customers, based on the quality of our products and our CSR commitments."" To implement this near-shoring strategy, Rissmann relies on its historic industrial site in Nuremberg, Germany, on a network of partners in Hungary, where the company has a logistics platform, and on a new plant in Bulgaria, operational since 2022. The German site specialises in the automated and semi-automated manufacture of luxury boxes. It benefits from high-tech equipment that is constantly being modernised to deliver high levels of productivity, quality and responsiveness. Rissmann entrusts manual finishing operations to Hungarian partner workshops employing people with disabilities, thereby promoting their integration through work. The Bulgarian factory focuses on the manual assembly of bags and boxes, but will gradually be automated to meet growing demand. Currently being expanded to 7,000 m2 the Bulgarian site will also be equipped with hot stamping machines. To meet the diversified needs of the market, Rissmann combines its in-house production capabilities with those of its long-standing network of strategic partners in Asia, selected to meet the expectations of luxury brands in terms of professionalism, quality and sustainability. The company has a sales and quality administration office in Qingdao, China, and a sales office in Hong Kong. Another of Rissmann's strengths is its holistic approach to production, from design to industrialisation, innovation and sustainability. ""Integrated industrialisation is a key issue for the success of industrial projects in Europe, by relying on automation, where appropriate, to remain flexible,"" Sophie Ivens points out. ""The advantage of being a manufacturer is that we can work on the different automation options right from the design phase."" The emphasis on innovation is obvious in Rissmann's relationship with its suppliers. The company, which sources from prestigious papermakers in the luxury sector, or specialists in decoration techniques such as hot stamping, gilding, embossing etc. and printing, places great importance on the relationship with its value chain, opening its factories to collaborate on new techniques and product testing. The same holistic approach to sustainability is taken: the company uses solar energy for more than 60%, recycled and recyclable materials, biodegradable and compostable materials and implements social actions in all its activities. Rissmann is FSC-certified and has been awarded the EcoVadis Silver rating. Finally, it is worth noting the recent creation of Rissmann Inc. in the United States, reflecting the company's desire to extend its international reach and offer a closer service to its US customers."
Anaïk taps into the luxury packaging business with brand new collection,"""This new collection of 16 unique packaging solutions renews our offering with strong aesthetic choices and the use of materials that were diverted from their common use. Our goal is to provide consumers with a unique experience by transforming packs into true objects, while reinforcing festive gestures,"" Sarah Perrin Mathieu, Open-Innovation Manager of Anaïk told Premium Beauty News. Divided into three families of products – collaterals, boxes and calendars – the new collection aims to stand out not only by enhancing the brands' products, but also by giving a new meaning to the packaging, by making it a part of consumers' daily life. Thus, Anaïk's new range of collateral packs (Christmas Tiny Houses, Kraft Wheels, Corrugated Christmas Balls, Hanging Kraft Cracker) was designed as a set of decorative objects. The Tiny House collateral, for instance, can be used as a candle holder to dress up festive the tables of the holiday season. Anaïk has made this format one of its priorities. ""Collaterals already spotlighted in 2022 because they are cheaper than full size gift boxes. In a context of tight household budgets, they remain on the rise and we want to help brands integrate them into their marketing strategy."" As far as gift boxes are concerned, the company turned to Plexiglas, a material that is not usual for this type of packaging solution. ""In this saturated market, we wanted to make a difference with a material diverted from its classic use and strong enough to allow reuse over time,"" said Sarah Perrin Mathieu. Anaïk's Cubic Plexi Box, for instance, can easily transform into a jewellery box. Finally, Anaïk also launched a series of Advent and post-season calendars to help brands create engagement with their customers all through the holiday season. ""The post-Christmas calendar allows brands to extend the festive moment until the end of the year. With seven boxes only, it is also less expensive than an advent calendar,"" she added. With this new ultra-premium packaging collection launched in September in its showrooms in Paris and Villeneuve-d'Ascq, as well as in its sales offices around the world and in October at Luxe Pack Monaco, Anaïk wants to win over beauty brands, which already represent 65% of its turnover. The new collection also meets the needs of spirits and fine food brands. ""Specializing in fabric and sewn gifts for 50 years, we want to become a key player in the manufacturing and design of low carbon impact luxury packaging. With this new launch, our goal is to increase the share of packaging to 15% of our overall turnover by 2025 and 25% by 2030,"" said Anaïk's CEO, Frédéric Delloye, in a statement. A mission-driven company with B Corp certification and EcoVadis Platinum label, Anaïk works with long-term Asian industrial partners selected after a stringent purchasing process. However, manufacturing in France or Europe is also possible for certain products."
Aptar Beauty launches a range of overcap-free aerosol actuators,"The new range of aerosol actuators created by Aptar Beauty has been designed to eliminate the need for an overcap, while still ensuring the formula is protected. The innovation was made possible thanks to an intuitive locking and unlocking technology, dubbed twist-to-lock. The twist-to-lock technology eliminates the need for an overcap, meaning there is no cap to lose. It also for greater convenience and less material parts. According to Aptar, the it is easy and intuitive to use: the actuators are locked and unlocked with a simple 'twist' gesture. An audible click indicates when they are properly closed. The locking and unlocking system also limits the risk of breakage or leakage, making the range e-commerce capable and safe for on-the-go usage. Moreover, anti-slip ribs ensure a good grip in dry or wet conditions like the shower. The new range is made up of three actuators – Ringo, Nora and Tina – designed to dispense foam, gel and spray formulas, thus covering the main applications for aerosols. Ringo comes with two different nozzles, one for dispensing foam formulas, the other for gel formulas. It is designed for shaving, hair styling or shower products. Nora features a small size nozzle suitable for applying gel products. It is aimed at shaving or shower gel products. Tina is a spray actuator suitable for formulations such as hair spray, deodorant, sun spray or body spray. The three actuators boast clean and lean lines and a matte finish. Their two-part composition allows bi-colour decoration for more creative freedom. ""The range breaks the codes of standard aerosols, featuring premium aesthetics,"" highlights Aptar Beauty in a statement. As for the environment, the three actuators can be provided with a POM-free mechanism and up to 100% PCR (post- consumer recycled) content. Moreover, the twist-to-lock aerosol range is compatible with a ball valve, vertical valve or bag-on-valve, with two different skirt lengths (short and long). According to Aptar, production will start in 2024. In the meantime, Ringo, Nora and Tina will be showcased at Luxe Pack, from October 2 to 4, 2023 in Monaco. Earlier this year, Aptar has previously combined the twist-to-lock technology with its PZ Twist pump to create a sunscreen dispensing system for Nuxe that also has no cover."
Aptar's PZ Twist provides a beach-ready dispensing solution for Nuxe sun range,"Aptar's new PZ Twist pump features the twist-to-lock technology eliminating the need for an overcap. The new pump's locking/unlocking system therefore supports the brand's commitment to sustainability by reducing waste and eliminating the risk of losing a cap on the beach or anywhere outdoors. Made primarily of polypropylene (PP) and POM-free, the new PZ Twist pump is paired with Nuxe's new PET bottle. The overall pack design (pump + bottle) was finished with the brand's signature pearlescent gold color. According to Aptar Beauty, the new PZ Twist pump makes the product easy and convenient to use. Thanks to a new and intuitive gesture, consumers can lock and unlock the pump by twisting the actuator. ""Designed with a large, comfortable fingerpad with a soft-touch effect, the pump's usage is convenient and hygienic, for a smooth consumer experience,"" said the manufacturer in a statement. PZ Twist is also available with options such as anti-slippery ribs and a protective shield, for an even more hygienic solution. An audible click ensures that the pump is properly closed to avoid any leakage – a key feature that also guarantees its e-commerce capability. Actually, PZ Twist is safe for on-the-go usage and certified Amazon ISTA-6 [1]. In addition, PZ Twist features Aptar Beauty's high-end PZ engine, which offers a proven spray performance, even with complex and demanding formulations. ""Nuxe wanted an attractive, more sustainable pump that was easy to use – possibly with a new gesture – while keeping the same level of spray performance. PZ Twist ticked all the boxes and the interest was immediate. We designed it precisely for this kind of demand: less parts and suitable for omnichannel sales. Our innovation team successfully integrated the twist-to-lock technology into the PZ range. We are very proud of our collaboration with Nuxe and excited to see PZ Twist converting the Sun Care packaging market,"" said Madalina Dragan, Marketing Director Personal Care & Home Care EMEA, Aptar Beauty. Nuxe's Tanning Sun Oil SPF10, SPF30 and SPF50 and Delicious Sun Spray SPF30 and SPF50 were relaunched at the start of the year in Europe, Asia and South America."
"Aptar inaugurates their new ""haute couture beauty"" facility in France","""With the inauguration of this new state-of-the-art site dedicated to tailor-made luxury beauty, we have a more flexible and agile tool, which allows us to better respond to market demands. This site serves the ""haute couture"" segment of the beauty market, with shorter series, complex designs and constant innovation. We have not only brought factories together, we have boosted our ability to meet the needs of our customers,"" said Marc Prieur, President of Aptar Beauty. In operations since the beginning of January 2023, the new Oyonnax site represents a 42 million investment and occupies a surface area of 25,000 m2. Previously spread over five sites, 80% of its production tools were relocated in a record time of four weeks, thanks to the commitment of the local teams, creating a seamless transition to the facility for customers and employees. The entire construction and site development work was completed in less than a year. The site, which employs 460 people, is part of Aptar's global growth and transformation strategy. The objective is for Aptar Beauty to consolidate its leading position in the prestige packaging market, by making Oyonnax the new cradle of made-to-measure luxury packaging. By bringing together five sites in a single location, Aptar was able to improve its production processes and optimize the industrial and operational performance of its production unit dedicated to custom-made and high-end products. The site specializes in complex operations of injection, metallization, decoration and assembly of custom-made multi-material components. Significant investments have been made to equip the site with state-of-the-art machinery, with particular emphasis on seeking increased flexibility. ""There is a clear trend toward shorter series, with range animations becoming increasingly frequent, and the development of special formats for certain areas. We therefore need machines that can easily adapt to new formats, especially for the assembly part,"" said Florence Müh, Packaging Beauty Director. The transformation of the Oyonnax site was of course an opportunity to significantly reduce the environmental impact of Aptar's operations in the region, if only by eliminating the logistics flows previously necessary due to the dispersion of the production units. The new building meets the highest environmental standards. It will save 45% energy and reduce CO2 emissions by 58%1, through heat recovery and the end of inter-site transport. Indeed, the building is technologically and sustainably innovative as it recovers all the heat from its internal processes to become virtually self-sufficient, has a new natural light detection system (LED/Advanced system) and an extra- white roof that absorbs heat and thus reduces the use of air-conditioning. These features and performance improvements have allowed for the site to obtain LEED v4 Silver level certification, the first French industrial site to receive this certification, as well as the label Biodivercity for the preservation of species around the site. ""Our new Oyonnax facility demonstrates our commitment to remaining a leading industrial player in France - particularly in this beautiful region. France has a long history of elegance, coupled with innovation and engineering expertise. Over the past five years, we will have invested 175 million euros to expand in France, further leveraging the exceptional talent and expertise and providing even more value to our customers,"" highlighted Stephan Tanda, President and CEO, Aptar."
"The future of beauty packaging: Five questions to Bénédicte Luisi, Aptar Beauty","Premium Beauty News - How far have you got with the sustainability objectives you set? Bénédicte Luisi - We have just published our annual report, which covers all the scopes we have been working on: production sites, transport, our social policy, and of course, our product range, for which we have made strong commitments to be proactive. We are doing everything we can to offer alternative solutions, in particular with more sustainable and responsible materials, to stop using fossil fuels, to incorporate recycled materials, and of course, to improve product recyclability, which will also lead to better quality recycled materials. That is why we adopted this proactive approach, but we still feel the market is experiencing a ""delay in starting"", in particular as regards recycled materials. Their use requires brands to make compromises, especially in terms of aesthetics. Still, demand and need are growing, because working with these alternative materials also helps brands meet their carbon reduction targets. An increasing number of customers tell us about carbon and traceability needs. They have made commitments and set up policies that go beyond the tightening of European regulations scheduled for 2025. Premium Beauty News - Right now, there is a tendency to focus on recycled materials and recyclability. What progress has been made in this area? What about recycled plastic supply? Bénédicte Luisi - We have created a specific catalogue to put forward all our quality products made from recycled materials. It helps our customers clearly identify what is ready. Most of our beauty products with materials derived from mechanical recycling were subject to various quality and technical tests. We have developed Aptar's own approach, PCR PLUS, to offer materials compatible with cosmetic applications when food compatibility is not available. We ensure their traceability and assess their toxicity and compatibility with beauty applications. Innovation-wise, we work upstream with committed partner companies, such as PureCycle. They have brought a new technology which, thanks to an additional decontamination process, results in ultra-pure, high-quality recycled polypropylene. Aptar is also part of the Next Loop project, another technology designed to obtain recycled PP compatible with beauty applications. Supply is a particular issue when it comes to recycled materials. For materials derived from mechanical recycling, we have secured contracts with material suppliers and anticipated market needs over the next two to three years. Things are more complex with chemical recycling, because the process is still in the pilot phase. But here too, thanks to our partnerships, we have secured supplies by looking 18 to 24 months ahead. We deal with hypotheses, so it is more like risk management. Generally speaking, we aim to use all the technologies available on the market to incorporate recycled materials, as they will help us increase our conversion rate and our use of recycled materials. Now, product recyclability is a complex issue, because the criteria and grids set out by European regulations are not completely clear yet. Overall, we need to focus as much as possible on mono-material packs made from PE, PP and PET: they are the three materials for which we have a recycling network. We need to stop using the materials that prevent products from being recycled. Premium Beauty News - Are new solutions to avoid plastic, particularly plant-based materials, a solution for the future? Bénédicte Luisi - Again, we have been assessing all solutions involving biosourced resins. But there are prerequisites: taking into account the impact on the product's end-of-life, checking the materials' compatibility with recycling, their behaviour according to biodegradability and compostability criteria, and the actual, quantified environmental impact in terms of carbon consumption, water consumption, land diversification, traceability, etc. Ideally, these materials should be derived from waste and co-products from an existing industry. We aim to take measures that have a real quantified impact. So, we use our ecodesign tool to check that the initial idea is really a good one, in practice, and that there is a real advantage in terms of environmental impact, for all the criteria mentioned. Premium Beauty News - Do you think refilling is the most effective solution in terms of sustainability? Bénédicte Luisi - Especially for certain applications. It is the solution for the perfume market, where there is a huge demand to extend the lifetime of products. And makeup products are concerned too. Today, products should be recyclable OR refillable, but regulations will soon require both criteria: packs will need to be recyclable, and so will the refill. So, it is a demand from brands, but it is not the only possibility being explored. Premium Beauty News - In conclusion, what do you think the beauty packaging of the future will look like? Bénédicte Luisi - Simpler packs in terms of materials: we need to move towards mono-material, fully recyclable products that fit into recycling channels and meet recyclers' requirements. We have been proactive on this issue: we transform our range on a daily basis to improve our environmental footprint through criteria such as recyclability, the use of recycled materials, and a reduced carbon footprint. We make no compromise on the actual impact and end-of-life management. Aptar Beauty releases a White Paper on sustainable materials The White Paper focuses on the contribution of dispensing solutions (pumps, airless, etc.) to the development of the circular economy, with the aim to address the solutions that are on the horizon to reduce environmental impact, and help the beauty industry become more sustainable.

"Zignago Vetro introduces Giotto Duo, the first 100% glass jar with separator","Dubbed Giotto Duo, Zignago Vetro's latest innovation dedicated to cosmetics and perfumery markets was designed to combine functionality, convenience and recyclability. Giotto Duo is reportedly the first glass packaging on the market to offer an integrated separator also made of glass. The mono-material design thus facilitates complete recyclability of the container. The exclusive use of glass as a material for this packaging offers another significant functional advantage: glass's characteristics of chemical stability and inertness guarantee in full the particular packaging requirements of cosmetic products. Giotto Duo can therefore contain two products and keep them perfectly separated. ""The presence of the integrated glass separator ensures high efficiency of use: the two products contained in the bottle are kept perfectly separate and maintain their integrity and quality, ready to be used individually or mixed at the time of application,"" explains the glass packaging manufacturer. Eventually, the transparency of the glass guarantees maximum visibility for the products it contains, allowing the creation of an immediate and appealing visual impact. Of course, Zignago Vetro's Giotto Duo can also be customized according to the specific needs of each project. The glass separator can be integrated to various glass shapes, allowing one to create unique and distinctive packaging. To complete its offer, Zignago Vetro can provide a wide range of accessories to personalize the product, including a diversified series of caps."
"For its 400th anniversary, Groupe Pochet looks to the future","""Celebrating 400 years gives us incredible strength to prepare for the future. We wanted to celebrate this anniversary by highlighting the present and projecting ourselves into the future,"" explains Xavier Gagey, CEO of Groupe Pochet. A luxury packaging manufacturer combining a multi-materials know-how in glass, plastic, metal, finishing and beauty accessories, Groupe Pochet today employs 3,700 people on three continents, with the ambition to combine sustainability and luxury packaging. The French glassmaker plans the electrification of one of the furnaces dedicated to luxury bottles and jars at its Pochet du Courval - Guimerville plant. Scheduled for the end of 2024, this technology shift is part of the company's global Decarbonation plan, which aims to reduce CO2 emissions by 50% by 2033. To address this objective, Groupe Pochet has also joined forces with French luxury group Chanel and cleantech company Metron to set up in all of its factories - in particular on the Pochet du Courval glassworks site in Guimerville - a digital tool to measure all of its energy consumption in real time. Metron's energy management tool allows to monitor all consumptions at the Guimerville plant, with the implementation of a consumption standard per item and per production line. According to Pochet, the new tool has already enabled a 27% gain in the gas consumption of its annealing arches since October 2022. Groupe Pochet has also partnered for 18 months with French start-up MagREEsource to supply its customers with recycled and made in France magnets. MagREEsource is developing an innovative technology to recycle magnets sourced in France from the dismantling of wind turbines or electric motors. Groupe Pochet intends to use these responsible magnets into perfume caps. ""Thanks to this innovation, the carbon footprint of magnet will be divided tenfold compared to the same magnet manufactured in Asia"", highlights Nicolas Piffault, CSR Director of Groupe Pochet. For its 400 years anniversary, Groupe Pochet considers its future depends on building meaningful partnerships with its entire ecosystem. ""We cannot do everything alone, the group will continue its transformation by opening up to the world,"" concludes Xavier Gagey."
Skincare brand Necessary Good runs on glass packaging and compostable refills,"Established in March 2023, Necessary Good makes skincare essentials. The brand has launched an initial range of hero products consisting of face mist, face wash, moisturiser and micellar water. Primary packaging are made of glass, a material chosen by the brand's founder given its durability, recyclability and aesthetics. Following a detailed packaging brief, British-based glass packaging company Croxsons produced two sizes of slope shoulder cylindrical glass bottles in 100ml and 200ml, sprayed in a leaf green pantone. Both bottles include screw atomisers, overcap dip tubes, lotion pumps and screw caps as closures. ""In terms of working with Croxsons, I have nothing but great things to say,"" said Assel Kapparova founder & CEO of Necessary Good. ""They were so responsive, accommodating and efficient throughout the project! When I showed them my packaging brief they helped me find the closest bottle match without having to consider a custom design - the match is uncanny. A big thanks to Croxsons for their guidance and the final glass products!"" Croxsons CEO, Tim Croxson, added: ""We are delighted that Assel has the right glass packaging to develop the Necessary Good skincare brand. We believe that the end result is both unique and modern, providing a visually appealing and memorable look. We wholeheartedly embrace Necessary Good's ethos, supporting their vision for a greener future. The company extends its best wishes to Necessary Good, hoping for continued success in their sustainable journey."" Croxsons launched its lifestyle, beauty, health and wellness division early in 2021 to complement its existing core business in supplying glass bottle containers, closures and decoration to international food and beverage brands. Necessary Good's refilling service utilises eco-refill pouches that can be conveniently composted at home and disposed of sustainably. They have partnered with packaging supplier OnRepeat for refill pouches made from 100% biodegradable and compostable materials. When consumers begin to run low on their Necessary Good products, they can simply order a refill pouch and transfer its contents, after having received it within two days. The company firmly believes that compostable, bio-based and biodegradable packaging presents the ideal solution for addressing waste issues within the beauty industry."
"The future of beauty packaging: Three questions for Frédéric Dreux, Unilever","Premium Beauty News - How to put an end to virgin plastic of fossil origin? Frédéric Dreux - Plastic is a very valuable packaging material - and, compared to many other alternative materials, it often has a lower carbon footprint. But plastic has no place in the environment. Globally, it's clear that the world must reduce its use of virgin plastic to further limit its environmental impact and, ultimately, prevent plastic from leaking into the environment. In this sense, it all starts with the reduction of virgin plastic and the scaling of new business models, materials, and technologies that support circularity to help – a top priority for Unilever, as part of our commitment to halve our use of virgin plastic through our ""less plastic, better plastic, no plastic"" sustainable packaging framework. One of the most significant opportunities is in our sourcing of post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic. Not only does PCR move us away from virgin fossil sources, but it also has approximately a 60% lower greenhouse gas footprint compared to virgin plastic. Unilever has made tremendous progress in this regard; globally, we've increased our use of recycled plastic to around 21% of our total plastic footprint since 2018, with many of our Prestige beauty brands also accelerating their use of PCR. Two examples that come to mind include Dermalogica's cleanser bottle which uses 50% PCR, and, in France, our Garancia brand using 100% PCR for the bottle of its cult micropeel product ""Pschitt Magique"". Premium Beauty News - What are the alternative materials of interest? Frédéric Dreux - Innovating with alternative materials – such as paper, aluminium, glass, and board – is a key part of our sustainable packaging strategy and plays an important role in reducing our use of virgin plastic. Our Prestige brands are increasingly experimenting with new formats that use alternative materials to remove plastic entirely from some of our products and packaging. For example, in 2021, REN Clean Skincare launched a beauty world-first through the introduction of re-closeable aluminium sample tube made with 100% recycled aluminium (95% PCR), providing consumers with a brand-new sampling experience without the need for mini plastic caps or tamper seals. When using alternative materials, however, it's important that we still take steps to minimise the environmental impact wherever possible – for example, by using recycled materials and ensuring a life cycle assessment approach is applied to compare materials and inform packaging decisions. Premium Beauty News - How do you approach the path of reuse? Frédéric Dreux - Supporting an industry-wide shift towards reusable and refillable packaging at scale – in addition to scaling our own successful models – is an important part of our plan to reduce the amount of plastic we use. We've tested a variety of reuse-refill models across our portfolio, building expertise, testing, learning, and exploring different approaches. One such example, on the market right now in France, is Garancia's ""Étoile du Jour"" face cream, which features a recyclable glass jar that can be refilled easily by consumers at home. What we've found is that different consumers have different wants and needs (based on where they live, how they shop, and what they buy) and that some product categories perform better as ""refill-at-home"" solutions, compared to ""refill in-store"" (and vice versa). The common thread is that any innovative solutions (particularly those that require considerable behaviour change) must still guarantee a positive consumer experience overall. This is why it's so important that we adapt solutions accordingly and remove barriers to entry, to help consumers form new habits. To ensure consumers come with us on the journey towards a global reuse-refill revolution, we'll also need buy-in right across the value chain – for example, from retailers, other businesses, and policymakers. We can't change a global system alone, which is why we are collaborating across the industry to help make this happen. For example, we're working with the World Economic Forum's Consumers Beyond Waste initiative, which seeks to create harmonised definitions, measurements, and reporting frameworks that will not only allow businesses to better track these new models of consumption, but also support well-drafted policy in the future."
Procos celebrates 25 years of packaging innovation serving luxury brands,"Since its founding in Munich, Germany, in 1998, Procos has been dedicated to the fashion, perfume, cosmetics, wines and spirits and jewellery markets. Initially focused on the production of paper bags, Procos soon expanded its portfolio to include cartons, boxes, cases and woven products. Since 2015, Procos has taken a keen interest in e-commerce issues, a segment that has seen exponential growth since 2021, driven by the manufacturer's innovations, as well as by the explosion in demand. Today, the company employs 40 people and achieved a turnover of 56 million euros in 2022. For an optimal supply chain, Procos produces through its partners in Europe, Asia and America, and has also set up warehouses and offices in Germany, London, Paris, New York, Qingdao and Shanghai - to be closer to its various partners. ""At Procos, we strive to be where our customers need us to be. We create and innovate to present packaging solutions that meet the new eco-responsible expectations of the market, as well as their quality requirements and their need to stand out. We have offices and production plants in several continents and we have also improved our e-shop platform for optimized logistic solutions,"" explains Leander Kritikos, founding CEO of Procos. In 25 years, Procos has distinguished itself by creating several original products mixing innovation and sustainability. In 2013, Procos launched the first all-paper bag for high-end brands and boutiques. The 100% paper body and cords made a big impression at the Luxe Pack Monaco trade show, where it was exclusively showcased. In 2018, the company bet on a convertible bag adapting to the seasonality of brands and the market's need for agility, thanks to an interchangeable sheet. In 2019, Procos introduced an interactive bag integrating NFC technology printed on paper. Made of 60% recycled fibres and 40% FSC Mix certified fibres, the plastic-free bag also had cotton handles to be 100% recyclable. In 2020, the manufacturer promoted another shopping bag: ""My Good Gift Bag,"" a bag made with recycled and recyclable materials, eco-friendly components for printing and assembly (soy-based ink, aqueous glue and aqueous selective varnish), and lighter because less material was used to make it. In 2021, Procos presented an innovative e-commerce box: its eco-friendly ""Yoga Light"" box, an all-in-one solution for brands. In 2022, the company distinguished itself with its ""New Material"" shopping bag: a smooth, single-material kraft and zero-plastic bag (no lamination and paper ribbon handles). The company also made a name for itself with the first version of its pop-up box, which was renewed at the beginning of 2023 with a special ""Chinese New Year"" edition and will soon be revived with an exclusive 25th anniversary version. Designed for e-commerce, this box stands out with a sheet added to the lid: it covers the products (tied with a ribbon for the gift aspect) and creates the pop-up effect when opened. In 2023, Procos unveiled a new paper bag, specially designed for the company's 25th anniversary: a white kraft paper bag with a structure and multifaceted 3D embossing with highly sensorial features. A large array of proposals that have enabled Procos to attract many luxury brands, such as Diptyque, Montblanc, or several brands within the LVMH, L'Oréal and Kering groups."
Brushes and applicators: Taiki expands its range of eco-sourced solutions,"Taiki Cosmetics Europe, the European branch of the Japanese company Taiki Group, unveiled its latest innovations in cosmetic accessories at the MakeUp in Paris trade show, on 14 and 15 June 2023. Constantly striving for excellence in eco-design, the company is pursuing its efforts to reconcile sustainability with exceptional performance. Among the highlights of this year's innovations, Bio-Blenders stand out for their composition based on bio-polymers (50-70% of the total composition, in addition to the traditional PU) derived from the upcycling of non-food waste. ""This approach considerably reduces the use of petroleum-based products, while offering an optimal user experience, even surpassing the softness of standard sponges,"" explained Alix Bellanné, Marketing & Communication Director at Taiki Cosmetics Europe. Two standard models of Bio-Blender are available: the Pure Bio-Blender, made from 50% upcycled bio-sourced ingredients, and the Blooming Bio-Blender, made from 70% upcycled bio-sourced ingredients. Both models are available in three different densities and can also be customised with a laser engraved company logo or custom cut and coloured. In the same vein, Taiki presented a new Duo Blender, a two-in-one accessory combining a convex hydrophilic sponge and a flat part made of Rubycell for the precise application of powders and creamy textures. This dual use reduces the number of sponges used, with the possibility of integrating up to 50% bio-sourced PU to reduce the environmental footprint. Taiki has also redesigned its cushions, to increase the proportion of bio-sourced materials used in their manufacture while preserving the product's absorbency qualities. With its new Ecodesigned Cushion Puffs, the company can now boast a percentage of 30 to 37% bio-sourced materials in these accessories. And the Asian Marshmallow Puff trend did not escape Taiki's attention. This sponge, two to three times thicker than a traditional make-up cushion delivers an exceptionally soft and plump feel. Alongside these advances in blenders and cushions, Taiki Cosmetics Europe presented an eco-designed brush for bespoke make-up results. Dubbed Adjustable Ecobrush, this innovation features a wooden handle and a 2-in-1 retractable tuft. The plastic-free mechanism means the shape of the brush can be adjusted to the desired use: – Position 0: the brush is retracted, protecting the synthetic vegan fibres when stored, – Position 1: short head, dense fibres, ideal for sculpting cheekbones or jaw lines, – Position 2: long head, softer tuft, perfect for an even make-up of the entire face. Finally, Taiki has also extended its range of skincare applicators, for which demand is growing: sponges for natural exfoliation and gentle make-up removal, brushes adapted to skincare textures and with handles made of wood, which remains the preferred material, or bio-resins (PLA in particular). With these new eco-responsible breakthroughs, Taiki Cosmetics Europe is consolidating its position and moving a step closer to a more environmentally-friendly cosmetics industry."
Carbios aims to become a leader in the booming plastic recycling market,"Carbios, a pioneer in the development and industrialization of biological recycling technologies for plastics, has announced the launch of a capital increase totalling an initial gross amount of around EUR 122 million, likely to be increased to around EUR 141 million if the extension clause is fully exercised. For the most part, the sums raised will be used to build of the company's first plant, with an estimated production capacity of 50,000 tonnes per year. The remaining will be will be used to fund PET R&D activities. This plant will be built in Longlaville, East of France, in joint venture with Indorama Ventures. Start of construction, recruitment and training of plant staff are planned to begin at the end of 2023, and commissioning of the plant is due in 2025. Carbios has secured an initial source of supply for its future plant by winning part of the CITEO tender for the biorecycling of multilayer trays. The company is in discussions with other players to secure the yearly 50kt of waste expected for the plant's full capacity. Thanks to its innovative technology, Carbios can minimize the use of bottles – an expensive feedstock — and gain in competitiveness by to diversifying its mix of raw materials to include food trays, fines and textile waste. According to Carbios' estimates – taking into consideration improved textile collecting and sorting, use of textile feedstock and advanced recycling scale-up – the global r-PET market is expected to almost double in 25 years. Thus, r-PET could represent 50% of the total PET market by 2050. Carbios' ambition is to position itself as a world leader to capture 4 to 8% of this market by 2030 and between 8 to 12% by 2035, and even 23% by 2050. In particular, the company should benefit from the strong growth of advanced recycling technologies, while growth in mechanical r-PET will be constrained by limited availability of feedstock able to be processed by this technology. Carbios also predicts that Virgin PET will also be limited due to lower demand for petro-sourced materials led both by brands' sustainability ambitions and governmental regulations worldwide. Carbios also emphasizes that its constant efforts to expand its innovation pipeline and extend its proprietary technologies to other polymers — especially polyamides (including nylon) and polyolefins (polyethylene and polypropylene) — are about to bear fruits with first patents expected from 2023. In collaboration with its academic partners, Toulouse Biotechnology Institute and the University of Bordeaux, Carbios recently published an article entitled ""Enzymes' power for plastics degradation"" in Chemical Reviews. According to the company, this article marks a turning point in the search for enzymes to degrade plastics other than PET and PLA. ""It is now time to take our industrial and commercial project a step further with the commissioning in 2025, in France, of the world's first PET biorecycling plant, in partnership with Indorama Ventures. It is with the aim of financing this plant, accelerating our R&D and the deployment of research activities for other polymers and other applications of our technologies, that we are launching this capital increase with the maintenance of pre-emptive subscription rights to let you take part in the acceleration of our growth,"" said Emmanuel Ladent, CEO of Carbios."
"Lumson's XPaper, the airless that combines elegance and sustainability","Lumson's paper airless option is the ""perfect combination of smart design, safety, and functionality with a sustainable twist."" And we'll explain why. XPaper takes sustainability to the next level.

In addition, the paper bottle is also much lighter (-50%) than an equivalent PET bottle. XPaper uses 47% less plastic and reduces CO2 emissions by 34% [1]. Besides meeting the growing demand for sustainability in the industry and the market, XPaper offers the maximum level of safety. The internal multi-layer pouch protects even the most delicate formula from the risk of contamination, ensuring its integrity. Versatility is the keyword for XPaper, and it's no coincidence that customization is one of the key factors of this solution. Thanks to various printing technologies, XPaper can be personalized with different effects and decorations, from minimal to sophisticated, to give a unique final result. From offset printing (up to 6 colors) that enhances the graphics, to hot stamping which gives packaging a refined look that further accentuates the final result. With these features, the packaging of the 'future' has a name: XPaper!"
Beauty Yaurient relies on the creativity of its beauty accessories,"For more than 20 years, the Chinese manufacturer of beauty brushes and applicators has been responsive to the main international trends to offer international brands full service solutions, integrating design, development and production. Beauty Yaurient offers its customers a comprehensive range of tailor-made products. The company also stands out with design proposals directly inspired by the C Beauty culture, for which cosmetic brushes are true works of art. The company thus offers brushes with tufts that are artfully cut to look like flowers, such as peonies and roses, or handles with exuberant shapes using a wide variety of materials (metal, wood, polymers imitating porcelain, etc.). Alongside its brushes and applicators, Beauty Yaurient recently introduced various high-end massage instruments with jade tips, providing a cool effect when in contact with skin. Also directly inspired by the Chinese culture of beauty, these products are patented and have already aroused the interest of several customers. In line with market demand, Beauty Yaurient now focuses on using sustainable materials. For instance, fibres used for the tufts are available in post-consumer recycled plastic (PCR) in proportions up to 100%, depending on customer demand. This approach helps to reduce dependence on virgin raw materials and contributes to the reduction of waste. The company also uses natural materials such as wood or various composites of natural origin for the production of the brushes' handles. Beauty Yaurient is also exploring different solutions to eliminate glue for assembling brushes and thus improve their durability and recyclability. SGS SA8000, ISO9001 and ISO14001 certified, the Chinese company is currently developing its CSR commitments. A Fair Trade certification is in progress for its two factories in Shenzhen and Liling (Hunan) and it has already obtained the WBE (Women Business Enterprise) certification. Despite difficulties during the pandemic years, Beauty Yaurient strives to stay at the forefront of changing trends and the needs of international customers. Eager to maintain contact with international markets, the company has chosen to participate in most major international trade fairs in 2023 and will thus be present at MakeUp in Paris, MakeUp in New York, Luxe Pack Monaco and Cosmoprof Asia, in Hong Kong. Beauty Yaurient is also exploring the possibility of opening a new factory in South Asia."
Luxe Pack: A Paris-Monaco train for a lower carbon footprint,"Eager to support their exhibitors and visitors in their decarbonization efforts, the organizers of Luxe Pack Monaco are taking into consideration the changes in transportation habits and have decided to charter a special train from Paris to Monaco. Actually, the train will leave Paris Gare de Lyon on Monday, October 2 in the morning for a direct journey of about 6 and a half hours to Monaco station. On board, travelers will enjoy an eco-responsible breakfast, lunch and entertainment. The one way ticket will be priced at 60 euros. ""We have frequent talks with the luxury houses that make up the bulk of our visitors and we have noticed that train transportation is chosen more and more frequently, for both practical or ecological reasons. We were keen to actively support them in their CSR approach and this special train is a first step,"" said Fabienne Germond, Director of the Luxe Pack shows. This initiative aims primarily to offer delegates a low-carbon solution. The carbon footprint of a train journey is 26 times lower than an equivalent journey by plane, according to the French Agency for Ecological Transition (ADEME) 2023 figures. Train is also a cost-effective solution and it offers increased networking opportunities. ""For sure, the journey is longer than by plane since there is no high-speed line all the way from Paris to Nice, but train provides the possibility to work on board or to talk to peers according, depending on one's preferences,"" underlined Fabienne Germond. Indeed, the organizers want the show to start as soon as the train leaves Paris station. Beyond the at-seat meal service, travelers will have access to massage services or to the opportunity to taste local food products. Shuttles will be waiting for them at Monaco station to transport them to the Grimaldi Forum, the event's venue, in a few minutes, for a seamless journey. The organizers explain that they were able to offer this service at a particularly affordable price thanks to the support of the Monaco's Government and the Mission for Energy Transition of the Principality of Monaco. The organizers of Luxe Pack Monaco said that, if successful, this first test is intended to be repeated and even amplified next year. ""We are not used to deciding for our visitors on their departure and arrival dates during the three days of the show. Their arrival date fluctuates according to their origin, their agenda, their means of transport… We therefore had to agree on a date and a place of departure. This year, we are offering this train from Paris as a one-way trip, but if the test proves successful, we would obviously like to offer a round trip,"" continued Fabienne Germond. Eventually, other routes could even be opened, if the number of potential travelers is sufficient. In any case, this initiative is only a first step in the process of reducing the show's carbon emissions. ""We are currently conducting a detailed Carbon Assessment which will allow us to further improve the management of our resources and our participation proposal in the years to come. In the same way that the success of the show depends on a collective of exhibitors and visitors, the ecological transition of the event will not happen without them,"" concluded Fabienne Germond."
Chanel chooses an aluminium decoration for the new Chance bottles,"Chanel has taken on a strong objective for all of its product lines in opting to decrease their environmental footprint. Thus, for the decoration of the new Chance bottles, the brand has chosen to replace the galvanised varnished brass band surrounding the bottle with anodized aluminium. In addition to its lightness, aluminium has the advantage of being one of the most recycled metals to date. The change in material also allows to avoid the use of chemicals that are necessary for galvanizing. These new metal strips are made in the south west of France by g.pivaudran and assembled by glassmakers partnering with the brand, in both France and Italy. ""This change, which is admittedly unnoticeable by consumers, nevertheless represents a strong symbolic gesture by Chanel in its eco-responsible transformation, stripped of any ostentatiousness as well as being both effective and practical,"" said g.pivaudran in a statement. The manufacture of strips around the Chance bottles was a considerable challenge for teams of employees at g.pivaudran. They had to use their entire range of expertise to shape a fine aluminium strip (0.6mm), highly delicate in its manipulation, which sat perfectly around the cylindrical curvature of the bottle which retaining the shiny aspect of the material. A complex range requiring the total flexibility of strips, combined with the precision of automated assembly. Chanel is launching the sale of these new bottles with the 100 ml version. All other formats will be decorated with an anodized aluminium strip for 2024. g.pivaudran has now taken over the production of the new strips for the all formats (35 ml, 50 ml, 100 ml and 150 ml) of fragrances. According to g.pivaudran, this achievement for Chanel illustrates the many possibilities offered by aluminium, both in terms of design and eco-responsibility. The company provides premium and luxury brands with ""100% aluminium"" packaging solutions that can also be made from recycled aluminium. ""Our expertise allows us to shape aluminium in a host of manners, to assembly a range of materials and resolve the current requirements of our clients. Aluminium, by its very nature, is eco-responsible, can be endlessly recycled, is lightweight and suitable for multiple uses, and forms our response to the desire for added value by luxury brands"", said Marc Pivaudran, CEO of g.pivaudran. During the Édition Spéciale by Luxe Pack trade show, which will be held on 7-8 June 2023, in Paris, g.pivaudran will present a wide range of products made with its clients as well as tests and prototypes showcasing aluminium."
"The future of beauty packaging: five questions to Gilles Swyngedauw, Albéa","Premium Beauty News - About 15 years ago, Albéa committed to developing circular packaging solutions with a low environmental impact as part of its CSR programme. How far are you in this process? Gilles Swyngedauw - We have been following our ecodesign roadmap, which is focused on safety for human health and for the environment. We have added the transparency chapter to perfectly understand our raw materials supply chains. Other than the carbon impact, biodiversity is a key issue in terms of environmental impact. We are still working hard on the circularity programme. And as for tubes, we have recyclability solutions for over 90% of our products currently on the market. Now, things are more complex with cosmetics packaging, because it is smaller, much decorated, it often contains several materials, etc. We have been working with Citeo to understand what we should implement, so that it is efficiently detected and ends up in the right branch to be recycled. It is a huge project, but we have been making progress, and we will publish our conclusions during the second semester, most probably at the Luxe Pack Monaco show. Premium Beauty News - There is also a huge demand regarding the integration of recycled materials. How do you cope with supplying difficulties? Gilles Swyngedauw - That is another broad subject. First, there is quality: we are part of a working group on the quality of recycled packs in cosmetics, which is composed of peers and marketers. The idea is to understand health-related challenges and to make better recycled choices depending on the cosmetic applications. We only talk about mechanic recycling, because in terms of environmental impact, it is still the best solution, and it is making a lot of progress, performance-wise. Right now, this branch offers real aesthetic quality and satisfactory health security. Our work consists in selecting the materials rigorously – PET, PP and PE derived from mechanic, or even chemical recycling. Albéa considers using these two solutions, because they are complementary. It is true that, as far as supplying is concerned, there is still a quantity issue. Plastic is still not much recycled. In addition, the packaging industry is not the only one concerned by the recycled option. The textile, car, even the building industry... Everyone is interested in this material mainly generated by packaging. So, our offering is getting broader, but not fast enough, compared to the demand, which is booming, driven by regulations. Premium Beauty News - Is the biosourced material option also a priority? Gilles Swyngedauw - If it is made of plastic, a biosourced material remains plastic. It needs to be recycled. So, biosourced materials will not solve all problems, and the first thing to do is rather to keep working on recycled materials and to make our products recyclable. We will never have enough fields and forests to replace all the plastic that is made from oil today. I mean, first, we need to enter a circular economy. Premium Beauty News - Refills seem to be an efficient solution as regards sustainability. How have you been working on this? Gilles Swyngedauw - The priority is to minimize the number of packs ending up in landfills. As a matter of fact, before thinking about refills, there is a lot to do to reduce weight, overpackaging, and ""useless"" packaging parts. As for reuse: it takes time to make consumers accept new systems. We have technical solutions, but the business model should suit brands, and the use should suit consumers. Our world is focused on convenience, so we have been working hard to innovate and make the gesture as easy as possible. We have been looking for intuitive solutions, in particular with jars, to be able to refill only the quantity needed. Some categories are more complex, like mascara, because they require changing everything, which is meaningless. The second most important aspect is to design refills which are light and perfectly protect the formulas, while delivering the right quantity... And they need to be recyclable, otherwise it is counterproductive. Premium Beauty News - What is your view on the future of beauty packaging? Gilles Swyngedauw - The main point is to work on circularity, first. In this area, there is still a lot to do, but European regulations will help us and have a significant impact. There are also many ideas that are not so good, but packaging manufacturers and brands have been doing a real collaborative job to boost valuable initiatives. One thing is for sure: we will only make it if we embark everyone on our journey."
Stora Enso unveils cosmetic tube made of 85% paperboard fibers,"Intended for cosmetics and personal care applications, the new tube is composed of Stora Enso's barrier-coated board material Natura Shape and a screw cap designed in collaboration with Blue Ocean Closures with assembly by AISA. Stora Enso says the packaging solution has fiber content of over 85%, which it claims is the highest proportion available in a tube design. Officially unveiled at Interpack 2023, which was held in Düsseldorf, Germany, from May 04-10, the new it is expected to be commercially available in 2024. Stora Enso first launched its paperboard tube concept for cosmetics packaging in 2019 at Luxe Pack Monaco. By adding the tube with a fiber-based cap developed by the Swedish start-up Blue Ocean Closures, the Finnish-Swedish group has achieved an unprecedented reduction in the amount of plastic remaining in the packaging. The innovative cap is made of more than 95% fibers from wood cellulose. It is strong and has a high density and can be decorated. It screws onto an overmolded hybrid shoulder, made from cardboard and PE (40-70% fiber content). The assembly of the whole solution was provided by AISA, a world-leading tube machinery manufacturer. ""We know that brand owners face challenges when trying to find sustainable alternatives to plastic tubes and believe it is essential to increase fiber content to reach a higher degree of recyclability, reduce carbon footprint, and meet consumer expectations,"" said Lars Sandberg, CEO at Blue Ocean Closures. By utilizing wood fiber, this concept aims to reduce the amount of plastic used in tubes, thus helping brand owners increase the share of renewable and sustainable material in their packaging solutions. ""We believe that it is essential to increase fiber content in order to futureproof paperboard tubes with increased recyclability and reduced carbon footprint,"" highlighted Martin Hammer, Business Developer at Stora Enso. The Swedish-Finnish paper mill group claims that all components of the paperboard tube are designed for recycling. However, the recycling of composite materials remains a practical challenge. Methods such as pyrolysis and solvolysis can be used to remove resins from composite packaging and enable the reuse of the fibers, however this type of recycling infrastructure is not widely available to date. Nevertheless, this innovation is a significant step forward since it helps to reduce plastic consumption for a packaging that remains difficult to recycle anyway."
INCA Packaging expands its offer of sustainable aluminium solutions,"Among its latest innovations, Inca Packaging showcased its recent collaboration with Collistar for Puro lipstick. The new packaging consists of a polypropylene base and cap, complemented by a refillable aluminium mechanism. The refill can be replaced indefinitely, generating a saving of more than 50% in plastic. At PCD Milan, Inca Packaging also presented a new version of its eco-designed luxury travel-spray, initially unveiled at Paris Packaging Week earlier this year. Made up of 100% recyclable aluminium covering a glass bottle, this refillable packaging is designed to safely house the glass bottle and perfectly suit the need of people on-the-go. The wide range of customization possibilities (hot foil stamping, pad printing, screen printing, engraving) makes possible to create a unique item. Given the popularity of this product, Inca packaging has extended the range with two additional items: a lipstick and a lid for cream containers made of aluminium. The lipstick is designed with a 100% recyclable aluminium cap and base and a plastic mechanism. Inca Packaging also highlighted its know-how in the production and decoration of aluminium candle lids. For instance, the manufacturer created an exclusive decoration with four colour gradients on a dark background for the candle holder of the Accessories line of Parisian brand Diptyque. The intense colours are inspired by ancient ceramics. Other high-end prestige brands, such a Maison Francis Kurkdjian, Etro or Mirko Buffini, also entrusted Inca's know-how for their candles. ""We are fully equipped with polishing and brushing equipment suited for working on cylindrical or shaped parts. Our two anodising lines allow us great flexibility in terms of production and finishing. Screen printing, pad printing or hot stamping are part of our decoration techniques but we also master sublimation technology to provide an unlimited number of colours and shapes,"" said Stefano Parodi, CEO of Inca Packaging. Thanks to its flexible manufacturing process, Inca Packaging positions itself as the ideal supplier for niche perfumery brands looking for high-quality packaging with advanced levels of customization, even for small series. The Italian manufacturer illustrated its know-how with recent works for French fragrance brand Parfum d'Empire (a shiny gold anodised aluminium cap with the logo engraved on the top), for Olfactive Studio (cap and shoulder anodised in custom matt copper colour), Caron (a series of customized aluminium caps lacquered in white, blue and black, or anodised in bright silver), and with Italian brand Nasomatto (the bottle of the Blamage line and its 3D wood effect obtained by glass sublimation)."
Guerlain chooses Aptar's Evolux pump for its new liquid foundation,"Designed for prestige skincare and makeup products, Evolux is Aptar Beauty's best-selling premium pump for the luxury market. ""Easy to use and adorned with an elegant metal finish, it offers a high-end user experience and a sophisticated aesthetic finish,"" explains the global leader in dispensing systems. For this new launch, the Evolux pump was extensively tested with Aptar's Applied Science Department to ensure optimal formula compatibility and flawless dispensing with Guerlain's advanced formula. Terracotta Le Teint is Guerlain's first liquid powder, a 24-hour, no-transfer natural foundation of 95% natural origin. With this innovation, the brand aims to offer the lightness of a powder and the perfection of a foundation in 30 true-to-skin shades, for a radiant outdoor healthy glow. Evolux' Alpha cartridge is POM-free (i.e. free from polyoxymethylene) and has a metal-free pathway to perfectly protect the formulation. According to Aptar Beauty, it is the only cartridge on the market perfectly adapted to the specific features of next-generation formulations like Terracotta Le Teint. Made in France at Aptar's Le Neubourg plant, the metal dispensing system is anodized in gold, precisely matched with Guerlain's signature colour, with the brand's 'GG' initials engraved on the top of the actuator. ""This collaboration with Guerlain has resulted in a perfect match between formula and dispensing system, preserving the integrity of the product and delivering an enhanced user experience,"" said Patrick Bousquel, Marketing Director Beauty EMEA Aptar Beauty. Aptar Beauty's Evolux pump was also used for Guerlain's Parure Gold rejuvenating foundation, launched at the end of 2022."
"""The industry is going to run out of recycled plastic"", Julien Tremblin, TerraCycle","Premium Beauty News - What is the current state of play regarding the reuse of plastic? Julien Tremblin - Today, there is a glaring inadequacy between the commitments of brands and the will of legislators, on the one hand, and the actual availability of recycled plastic, on the other. Brands are choosing to use recycled content and, at the same time, several European countries are starting to make the use of recycled plastics mandatory. The industry has high commitments, with high levels of recycled content being incorporated. As a result, demand is skyrocketing. It is a sincere and unquestionable desire to improve things. But this is out of touch with the reality of the amount of recycled plastics available. In its report, ""Plastics - The Facts 2022"", Plastics Europe indicates that only 5.5 million tonnes of recycled plastic had been incorporated in 2021, which only represents 9.9% of European plastic consumption. Premium Beauty News - Why is there such a disconnect between supply and demand? Julien Tremblin - The problem comes firstly from the concentration of demand on a small number of materials. The plastics reintegrated into the packaging are often PET or HDPE. These plastics have many other uses and are therefore sought after by many manufacturers. At the same time, the increase in energy costs in Europe, due to the war in Ukraine, has a direct impact on recycling costs. We can therefore see a bleak situation emerging. Today, a recycler has no reason to go looking for a material that is not in demand. Instead, the most demanded materials (aluminium, PET) are becoming ever more expensive. Once energy costs are taken into account, the integration of recycled content appears less and less viable. To make the economic equation more advantageous, in favour of recycled content, the UK has introduced a plastic tax (a malus) on products that do not have 25% recycled content. But the situation today is such that this may not be enough to offset the extra cost of recycled material. More generally, the problem with these taxes is that revenues generated are not necessarily allocated to the development of additional recycling capacities. Premium Beauty News – Will chemical recycling and, in the long run, enzymatic recycling allow increasing the quantities of available materials? Julien Tremblin - Chemical recycling can be interesting, the problem is that it is not available yet on a large scale and that heating greatly reduces yields. Enzymatic recycling is a promising technology, but it has not yet been deployed on an industrial scale. Today, we are even witnessing a decrease in recycling rates in some countries, and the global share of recycled plastic is decreasing due to an ever-increasing production of virgin material! Premium Beauty News - What could be the short-term solutions? Julien Tremblin - I think the first way to solve the problem is to abandon the ""virgin mentality"" that currently drives packaging design and which is based on an abundance of cheap resources. It's a paradigm shift that would involve, for example, starting to design packaging in a closed loop. A lot of cosmetic packaging is not made of PET or HDPE but uses other materials - such as ABS - for which there is no recycling channel because collection costs are considered too high. For these materials, we encourage companies to create closed loops. The first step is to approach a recycler and ask if they would be able to recycle a particular material if a source was available. Once this point has been settled, manufacturers can be sure that they have the necessary recycled material and will have avoided the landfilling or incineration of ""less desirable"" plastic materials. We have already set up many collection programmes at the POS with cosmetics companies. Another solution is to design the packaging directly from the waste. This concept is very similar to the previous one but is not a closed loop. The idea is to work with recycling centres to find a source of waste that they do not recycle but whose properties match the characteristics of the packaging to be designed or source it themselves. One possibility is to focus on the collection of waste with an identifiable track record and therefore with a traceable origin (e.g. litter or marine waste). Premium Beauty News - In any case, it seems obvious that recycling is no silver bullet. Julien Tremblin - This is an important message to convey! Recycling is essential but we know very well that if we want to change the situation, we need to set up new economic models, to move from disposable to reusable. We need to increase reuse rates in all areas! Some solutions are specific to the beauty industry, others are multi-sectoral and available on a global scale. This is our aim with the creation of Loop, our packaging reuse division. Other initiatives are being put in place by distributors. That said, we cannot ignore the importance of reducing waste at its source. We must all contribute to a better future by consuming less, or at least differently."
"The future of beauty packaging: Five questions to Denis Paccaud, Texen","Premium Beauty News - On March 29, you highlighted the dangers of ""announcements"" regarding alternative materials to plastic. Why this warning? Denis Paccaud - It is essential to be vigilant so that the cure is not worse than the disease. I believe it is important to maintain a certain level of objectivity concerning the alternatives proposed. Indeed, they can provide some answers and improve some of the negative aspects of plastic, but not systematically. I am referring, for example, to cellulose derivatives: their properties are very interesting in terms of eco-responsibility and recyclability, but on the other hand, they are sensitive to water-based liquids or fatty liquids, such as oils. They can therefore rarely be in contact with the formula itself. This means that it is often necessary to insert a plastic film between the formula and the packaging to limit unwanted exchanges between the two materials. Another example is that some biobased materials have their biodegradability or recyclability reduced or even cancelled out after undergoing chemical transformation. Even if they were initially made from natural materials. Premium Beauty News - On your side, what alternative materials are you exploring? Denis Paccaud - Texen's Innovation Department has several areas of focus, in the medium and long term, but also in the short term, particularly with a view to pre-qualifying materials proposed by manufacturers. Regarding the medium and long term, we are mainly working on recycled and biosourced plastic polymers, because it is the most abundant material today. It is in our interest to select the most relevant recycled materials, identify their specificities and how to use them and, of course, reuse them. Of course, recycling channels are still needed, but this matter is moving forward. T.E.O (Transition Ecologique Observatoire) has just announced the forthcoming opening of a new recycling channel for polystyrene. We are also focusing on materials that will be recycled in the near future and of course biobased and biodegradable materials - such as PLA and PHA - although today there is still a very mixed acceptance regarding these materials. At Texen, we only propose a few of them to our customers. Our ambition is to fully master them and minimise all the risks related to the use of these ""new"" materials before integrating them into our catalogue and production lines. Another area we are working on is our ability to separate the different packaging materials and components and to thoroughly focus on the design of single-material solutions. Premium Beauty News - A lot of companies have set themselves targets in terms of use of recycled materials and recyclability of their packaging. We have the feeling that this is the subject on which we are making the most progress. Denis Paccaud - Manufacturers now have a perfect command of how to produce plastic materials and transform them. But the industry has not yet reached maturity concerning the recycling chain and must continue to innovate and optimise the processes for the collection, sorting and recycling of materials. The climate crisis and the growing awareness of our customers are driving us to take into account new parameters in the development of products, particularly to facilitate their recycling. We are in the midst of a real transition process, also driven by regulations with the 2025 and 2030 deadlines. Today in France, 30% of the plastic that can be recycled - mainly PET - is actually recycled. What's more, mechanical recycling is showing its limits, especially for cosmetic uses requiring ""food grade"" certification. This is why the industry is looking for other techniques such as chemical recycling, which is certainly more energy consuming, but offers more possibilities, or enzymatic recycling - which seems to be proving its worth for the moment on some materials and is less energy consuming. Premium Beauty News - Refills are often presented as the most efficient solution to reduce packaging. Texen has been involved in the manufacturing of refills for Stella McCartney's brand. What is your take on this? Denis Paccaud - With the example of the Stella McCartney brand products, you are highlighting one of the most successful solutions in terms of refillable products. Indeed, in this case, the plastic of the refill is minimised while use cases are maximised. The refill can be used alone or in its pump bottle. And it is fully recyclable as it is made of a single-material film with no aluminium. The carbon footprint and the use assessment of these products are really interesting. There are other solutions, less advanced but just as interesting, which involve rigid plastic refills and whose carbon footprint remains largely positive. However, we must make sure that the refill does not devalue the product's image and that the refill process is not a chore but a pleasant gesture. Our mission is, on the one hand, to provide the user with a comfortable and even fun way of refilling and, on the other, to offer refillable products with a longer life span, so as not to tire or disappoint the consumer. This is a real challenge. So yes, refillable products can be a solution for reducing packaging. It is of interest to our customers, mainly luxury or premium brands because one of its limits is obviously its cost. Premium Beauty News - New textures are emerging today (solids, anhydrous, powders), with new issues in terms of packaging. What is the state of innovation on this subject? Denis Paccaud - We are questioning our clients about these new formulations and have launched brainstorming sessions and concept studies. There is certainly a way forward for powders, which need to be ""watered down"" to be used. In addition, you must make sure that the mixture is well-dosed and homogeneous, otherwise, the preparation will be too liquid or too thick. A routine that in my opinion requires a container specifically designed for a simple and quick preparation gesture at the risk of losing the consumer."

Verescence launches a rating scale for the weight reduction of luxury vials,"Among the many options available to reduce the environmental footprint of luxury perfumes and cosmetics packaging, reducing the amount of materials used is often one of the first actions to be implemented. In the case of a heavy material such as glass, the benefits are immediate. To facilitate decisions in this area as soon as the design and conception phases start, Verescence launches Glass Score, a tool helping to evaluate the level of weight reduction of glass vials, without the influence of the container size. The rating system assigns a score ranging from A+ (the most lightweight) to F for each bottle, enabling brands to compare their products on a universal scale and develop new glass weight-reduction projects. According to the French glass maker, the average score of perfume and cosmetic bottles on the market is between B and C. The new tool will help to guide brands towards a more virtuous Glass Score rating by proposing realistic weight reduction goals that respect the initial design of the project. ""Glass Score is a simple and effective tool that allows us to understand the level of weight reduction of a glass bottle or jar, propose weight reduction solutions and help our customers make informed choices in eco-design. This initiative has already generated great interest from our main customers,"" says Samuel Joachim, Director of Innovation and Development at Verescence. The launch of Glass Score is part of Verescence's ""Glass As a Service"" program, which aims to offer a complete range of eco-design services to its customers since 2017, including Life Cycle Analysis (LCA), recyclability study and 3D modelling. At the beginning of the year during the Paris Packaging Week show, Verescence has unveiled, in collaboration with French designer De Baschmakoff, two fragrance bottles illustrating their technical expertise in using lightweight glass for complex shapes. With an organic shape featuring an off-centre screw neck, the Moon bottle (106 g for 100 ml) offered a perfect symmetry of its faces for a comfortable grip. For its part, the Gem bottle (97 g for 100 ml) had a geometrical design with sharp angles and a broad octagonal facing. To make them even more sustainable, these refillable bottles (SNI 15 screw necks) were personalized with a spherical mono-material LegnaPin cap made by premium wood component manufacturer Minelli Spa (mPackting). Lightweighting (reducing the amount of material used) is usually presented as the first step in packaging sustainability, along with recycling and reuse."
Bormioli Luigi expands its production capacity and decreases GHG emissions,"The new configuration of the Spanish site of Bormioli Luigi is taking shape more and more finely. Located in Azuqueca, 40km from Madrid, it had been used for the group's tableware activity since its acquisition in 2017. In 2021, the group had initiated the installation of a first IS machine on the site with the aim of serving the masstige segment of beauty. The first of the lines has been running since 2022 and two more will be brought online during the first half of 2023 and the fourth at the beginning of 2024, ultimately representing total capacity of 90 million units per year, allowing the group to increase its total production capacity by a third. This strategic operation is part of a larger investment plan that was put in place starting in 2019. It will bring the group's total number of production lines to 18, spread over three sites. By increasing its production capacity, Bormioli Luigi's initial aim was to address the demand for glass primary packaging in the skincare and make-up categories. The market context has decided otherwise; the growth of fragrance has outpaced that of cosmetics products in recent years. Today, Bormioli's new Spanish capabilities, allows the group to serve the demand for increased volumes from its customers in the perfume category. Eventually, a decoration workshop will be added to the four IS machines. ""For the future, the Spanish unit will serve to balance demand on the fragrance market,"" said the glassmaker in a statement. As the 2019-2023 investment program of 200 million euros is coming to an end, a second program will succeed it for the 2024-2028 period. According to Bormioli Luigi, it will allow for structural growth, the management of equipment and product flows and strong, sustainable innovation. ""We must continue to support brands with an adapted service in line with demand, build growth as partners, optimize products and engage in ever more sustainable innovation,"" explains Simone Baratta, director of the Perfume & Prestige Business Unit. In particular, these future investments will focus on reducing the group's environmental footprint. Indeed, Bormioli Luigi's ambition remains to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by 50% between now and 2030. A pioneer in terms of electric fusion, which already represents 65% of its total production, the group is working towards the electrification of its processes and the hybridization of certain gas furnaces. In addition to this, it is adding energy from renewable sources. The group claims these structural modifications will also allow to face up to the volatility of energy management in real time. In addition, Bormioli Luigi is implicated in major projects in collaboration with its peers, notably around the use of alternative technologies like hydrogen."

Our job doesn't stop when the product has been delivered, our job is to ensure brands stand out through every tangible interaction that their consumer's engage with. Products that are out of step with current market trends - or consumer expectations - don't stand a chance on the market. Premium Beauty News - And what about sustainability? Alexandra Joneaux - Sustainability is at the forefront of what we do and is acknowledged by our EcoVadis Gold and B Corp certifications. Our in-house CSR Director and Head of Sustainability works in tandem with our global teams to review all our processes, ensuring that every product we offer meets the key requirements in this area. We are constantly in search for new sustainable materials which we can bring to life for our clients. During our recent showing at Paris Packaging Week, we gifted attendees a custom 'PARIS' zippered pouch, designed with a woven material containing 100% recycled plastic waste and coated with water-based acrylic. For every 1sq meter of material, over 5 plastic bottles are removed from the ocean. To replace plastic polybags, we have also launched PVA-based protective bags, which are water-soluble and fully biodegradable, with no microplastic residues. We have also recently introduced dissolvable materials in packing solutions, such as compostable packing peanuts (which are non-toxic and plant based and dissolves in water). Premium Beauty News - As far as production is concerned, capacity is an important issue but agility is also a growing demand from the market! Alexandra Joneaux - That's right, today we have brands that need programs dreamed, designed, developed, and delivered in less than two months! Internalizing the entire design process gives us tremendous agility. Our global production capabilities in Europe and North America allow us to ensure nearshoring benefits to our customers. Currently, 35% of our production is achieved in North America. We are constantly expanding our supplier base, aiming to reach 12% of production based in Europe by end of 2023. As Asia remains a necessary destination for all labour-intensive products, we are therefore seeking to diversify and develop our global supply chain in Southeast Asia, particularly in Cambodia and Vietnam."
Ere Perez Natural Cosmetics launches 100% aluminium eco-refillable compact,"Ere Perez Natural Cosmetics was born in Bondi Beach, Sydney in 2002. The sustainable and natural beauty brand offers a range of makeup and skincare products for consumers seeking minimal, ethical and healthy beauty. To further reduce the environmental footprint of its packaging, the brand has recently launched a mono-material refillable compact, made of 100% aluminium. When purchasing either the Corn Setting Powder or the Rice Powder Bronzer, consumers receive the Eco-Makeup Wheel, a refillable single material compact case made only from aluminium, an endlessly recyclable material. When the product runs out, consumers can purchase refills. They just have to take off the lid, unscrew the ring, place the refill in the base of the tray, and secure the ring back in place. Before that, in order to be recycled, the brand's traditional compact cases had to be disassembled in order to separate all the single-use materials. ""The Makeup-Wheel Refill Case is a beautiful, durable and refillable statement piece for a lifetime of enjoying Ere Perez natural & cruelty free pressed powders,"" says the brand in its website. More of the brand's face powders will be available in the Eco-Makeup-Wheel Refill Case later in the year."
Geka debuts innovative PCR fibres and sustainable decoration for mascaras,"Geka continues its sustainability efforts. At Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna, the beauty subsidiary of the Swiss group Medmix presented two major innovations to reduce the environmental footprint of cosmetic products. Complementing their biobased range of fibre filaments for mascara brushes, Geka is now making a PCR variant commercially available. The eyelash and eyebrow brushes in the new range feature 65% recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or polybutylene terephthalate (PBT). According to Geka, the new vegan friendly brushes offer excellent application performance thanks to a variety of designs available for volume, separation, curling or lengthening. As part of its full service offer for cosmetic brands, Geka provides a wide range of formulations compatible with the new PCR fibres. At Cosmopack Bologna 2023, Geka also debuted a new patented sustainable decoration service using no additional foil or ink. Dubbed ""shadow printing"" the new process is more sustainable as it modifies the surface of packaging without needing to use a foil or to add ink. It is suitable for bottles and caps, and has 360° design application, for a combination of matt and shiny surfaces. ""Shadow printing is incredibly flexible, allowing complex customized elements and patterns to be applied to bottles or caps. Combined with textures that create vivid surface finishes, customers can create extraordinary aesthetics that reflect brand identity. In fact, matt and shiny surfaces can be incorporated within the same design for maximum visual effect. When supplemented with hot foil stamp or silk screen printing, the opportunities are almost endless, ensuring uniqueness for any cosmetic,"" explained Huong Bister, Head of global R&D at Geka."
"FSKorea introduces GoBrush, a makeup brush with separable parts","The creation of this new brush by FSKorea's development team is a perfect illustration of the quest for sustainability in which the cosmetics industry is increasingly committed. ""The importance of preventing environmental pollution and climate change is such that we strive to actively respond to these developments by designing and developing products that reduce resource consumption in the production process, reduce waste and facilitate recycling. We have put in place a true culture of environmental responsibility,"" said J.K. Hwang, CEO, and owner of FSKorea. A culture of sustainability that was perfectly illustrated by the refillable mascara showcased at the latest Cosmoprof Asia trade show held in Singapore in November 2022. A standard brush is usually made of three parts, the fibres, the ferrule, and the handle. Most of the time, the different parts of the brush are glued together, and a brush manufacturer can use as much as 130 tonnes of glue per year. By creating a brush made of components that are separable, FSKorea not only helps to reduce glue consumption, the company also facilitates recycling while offering many possibilities for customization. This is the main feature of the GoBrush, which allows to assemble the three parts (fibres, ferrule, and handle) according to any combination, to change the fibres after use and to reuse the ferrule and the handle. It is therefore possible to offer handles and ferrules of different colours or different types of fibres. Beyond customization, the other advantage of FSKorea's GoBrush is obviously that it allows suitable sorting of the different components for better recycling. FSKorea exclusively holds worldwide patents for GoBrush. To meet the demand for eco-friendly packaging, FSKorea has set four strategic objectives: to develop environmentally friendly products, to improve the quality of products and services, to aim for complete customer satisfaction and to recruit well-trained people in this area. In 2021, FSKorea achieved both ISO14001 Certification for its environmental management policy and ISO 45001 Certification for its health and safety management system. It should also be noted that the company was certified by the Korean Ministry of Equality and Family Welfare as a model company concerning the handling and education of its employees. In recent months, FSKorea has developed several products that specifically meet these new environmental requirements. In addition to the rechargeable mascara already mentioned, let's also mention a new dropper made of separable components and with inner and outer caps made with aluminium to reduce the volume of plastic. In order to increase the product's recyclability, FSKorea also offers to replace the commonly used NBR [1] by a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE)."
"Sulapac launches a bio based alternative to hard plastics, including ABS","To meet the expectations of beauty brands seeking sustainable alternatives for conventional plastic packaging, Sulapac has expanded its portfolio with a new material designed to match with their qualitative and aesthetic specifications. Named Sulapac Luxe, the new bio-based material has been designed for substituting hard plastics, including ABS. The main goal was to create an environmentally conscious solution that would still offer high-end luxury feel, function, and aesthetics in line with the requirements of luxury brands. ""One major challenge beauty brands face in replacing conventional plastics is the strict performance criteria of the chosen materials,"" says Colin Strobant, International Sales Director at Sulapac. ""With Sulapac Luxe, we have shown that conventional plastics can be easily replaced without compromising on quality. We have listened to our customers' challenges, and the material has been through an extensive development process to ensure it stands up to the highest demands for luxury performance."" Sulapac Luxe is a high density material, that is resistant to temperature fluctuations. It offers a series of important characteristics for luxury brands: a ceramic feel and sound, and a glossy, smooth surface. This material is recyclable and, as all Sulapac materials, it can also be made with recycled content. Sulapac Luxe is made from industrially compostable materials, it leaves no permanent microplastics or toxic load behind. ""Sulapac is a pioneer in recycled bio-based materials and our aim is to use only recycled biopolymers within the next 5 years,"" says Sulapac's CEO and Co-founder Dr. Suvi Haimi. The material is commercially available to all manufacturers. According to Sulapac, Sulapac Luxe slips seamlessly into existing injection moulding production lines and several high-end beauty brands have already shown interest in utilizing it in combination with their existing glass fragrance bottles or jars. The Finnish company had already demonstrated its ability to meet the stringent requirements of luxury brands by developing exclusively for Chanel the sustainable bottle caps for the fragrance range Les Eaux de Chanel and the lid for the N° 1 de Chanel cream (FSC certified wood chips and upcycled camellia seed shells). The new launch comes on the heels of the creation of the BetterBarrel in partnership with makeup pencils maker Schwan Cosmetics last year, and Toly's Infinity Line for powder compacts. Besides materials for injection moulding and extrusion, Sulapac's portfolio includes solutions for thermoforming allowing cosmetic companies to create sustainable logistic trays and point-of-sale displays, as well as for 3D printing enabling sustainable prototyping."
Aptar strengthens fragrance sampling portfolio with iD Scent acquisition,"The specialist in perfume discovery through paper-based solutions is joining Aptar Beauty.

We are proud to have succeeded in meeting our challenge, as a result of our family complementarity and a close collaboration with our entire team! We are delighted of this integration to Aptar because their commercial and industrial power, together with our knowhow, will enable to serve faster the global need for more sustainable sampling solutions,"" said Maxime Caffon and Julie Naso, Co-Executive Directors of iD Scent."
Trade shows : Packaging innovations at Luxe Pack and MakeUp in Los Angeles,"In keeping with current major trends of today, beauty markets, exhibitors at MakeUp in LosAngeles and Luxe Pack Los Angeles pushed inventiveness to the highest level in order to showcase natural formulas as well as packaging solutions with a reduced environmental footprint. As far as packaging is concerned, France-headquartered beauty packaging maker Albéa won the MakeUp in LosAngeles innovation award for SVR's new Topialyse tube combining a 350 micron PE sleeve with their Ecofusion opening and closing system. The packaging solution reduces the overall use of fossil plastics by more than 50% compared to standard tubes. The packaging is made entirely of PE and is therefore ready to be recycled as part of the existing recycling streams for HDPE bottles. For its part, the American manufacturer Anomatic showcased Evercycle , its recyclable cap made of 100% recycled aluminum (with a guaranteed minimum of 60% PCR). Designed in partnership with Novelis, the world leader in aluminum rolling and recycling, this solution can be anodized or metallized. Hong Kong based Asquan unveiled a collection with a minimalist design for a complete skincare line featuring a 50ml airless pump, a 50ml jar and a 100ml dip tube bottle. Made primarily of PP, the line is styrene-free and has refillable units (50mL airless and 50mL jar). It is fully recyclable with some disassembly. Designed to make recycling easier, Apollo+Beauty's Double-R Dispensers make it easy to separate the spring from the plastic cylinder. Baralan's DEA Series (short for Developing the Evolution of Airless) is a selection of glass airless containers designed for several applications. Launched in 2022, DEA is the first airless system in which the filled product is directly in contact with its glass container. The DEA Series was developed through an innovative manufacturing process, which significantly reduces energy consumption and eliminates the need for lubricants. Epopack highlighted their PET Droppers, PET airless bottles and PET Heavy wall jars, together with ""100 Looks"", a new inspiration tool for the customization of stock designs. Selected among the finalists of MakeUp in LosAngeles Innovation Awards in the packaging category, HCT by KDC/ONE's Fenty Skin Watch is a serum dropper with a flexible, recyclable polypropylene refill and a wrinkled effect at the tip that allows it to be compressed and drained without the addition of silicone or other soft material. A j-lock at the bottom of the outer bottle allows for easy attachment of the inner refill with one simple movement. ICS (International Cosmetic Suppliers Ltd.) showcased a wide portfolio of mono material packaging solutions, including a new refillable roll on and metal free pumps. The packaging supplier also highlithed its recent collaboration with Eastman to offer color cosmetics and skincare packaging using Eastman Cristal Renew copolyester. Alongside XPaper, their paper airless solution launched last year, Italy's Lumson introduced their new Japa line of refillable jars and their new lightweight pouch airless pump APP Light. Qualipac America (Groupe Pochet) highlighted Optimo Wiper, their patented dispensing solution for liquid or viscous lipstick, lip gloss, concealer, or serum formulas that consist in a specific wiper that protects the product from contamination, prevents waste and leaves the package, applicator and stick perfectly clean with each use. Also, worth noting is the collection of eight double-ended applicators unveiled by Texen for a complete skincare and makeup routine. Named ""Rainbow,"" the collection is designed to simplify and shake up the skincare and makeup routine. Made from industrial starch, Toly's new Paperfoam Godet Holder features a hinge and closure that highlights the ability of the material to be molded into intricate details. Easy to compost and recycle, Paperfoam has an energy efficient and low carbon manufacturing process. Verescence showed the fragrance bottles made for OUI Juicy Couture (Revlon). According to the French glassmaker, the lacquered flacons are the first-ever stackable fragrance bottles. They feature a deep push-up enabling them to be stacked. The bottle received the 2022 Package of the Year Award from the New Jersey Packaging Executive Club (NJPEC). Eventually, Virospack showcased their new Duomix 2.0 Powder dropper dedicated to two-component formulas for extemporaneous application. According to the company, the new design renews allows an intuitive, easy and comfortable use. Also see our selection of innovative formulas spotted at MakeUp in LosAngeles."
"Somater launches an antimicrobial, refillable click-and-turn mascara","Somater, a French-based expert in the manufacture of primary polymer packaging for the cosmetics industry, has seized the opportunity of the latest Paris Packaging Week show (January 25-26, 2023) to debut a refillable mascara with their patented ""Click Turn and Apply"" (CTA) technology as well as an antimicrobial brush. Already displayed at the MakeUp in Los Angeles 2022 trade show, the ""Click Turn and Apply"" technology offers the benefit of a new high-quality opening movement. To create the first antimicrobial refillable mascara, Somater combined this technology with the know-how of Pylote, a major player in industrial mineral chemistry, and SIMP, experts in the development and manufacturing of innovative plastic mascara brushes. Assembled by Somater, this innovative mascara incorporates a bio-sourced plastic brush developed by SIMP and Pylote's unique metal-free, nanoparticle-free anti- microbial mineral technology in the stem and the brush. ""The implementation of an immediate, stable and permanent microbial de-contamination technology was a major requirement for the launch of a refillable solution intended for the sensitive area around the eye,"" Jérôme de Prémare, Head of Corporate Business Development at Somater, told Premium Beauty News. The stem and the brush were successfully tested in the independent laboratory Fonderephar. After 24 hours of activation by the Pylote technology, the results showed a 4-log reduction in the number of Escherichia coli CIP 53.126 bacteria on the stem and a 5-log reduction on the brush, which cor- responds to a disappearance of almost 99.99% of bacteria on the surface of the stem and 99.9999% on that of the brush. By activating surfaces to make them ""self-decontaminating"", Pylote's antimicrobial technology has already been proven effective against many microorganisms: – Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (>99.999% in 24h) and resistant bacteria. – Enveloped and non-enveloped viruses (SARS CoV-2 and its Delta variant >96% in 1h, H1- N1 influenza, gastroenteritis, herpes and conjunctivitis) as well as in real-life situations with a high frequency of contact. Furthermore, no modification of the existing manufacturing and filling processes of the packaging is required. The incorporation of Pylote's antimicrobial technology is done at the level of the resin. Beyond its advantages in terms of hygiene and safety of use, this new mascara also helps to reduce plastic waste by approximately 30% from the second use compared to non-refillable solutions. Fully recyclable, according to Somater, it can also be produced in recycled material (up to 100%, according to the brands' demand). This Activated Mascara can be decorated and customized at will, and is also available with a traditional opening system.

mPackting goes beyond wood with new low carbon luxury packaging solutions,"Wood has already made its way into the packaging of cosmetic products. This material – which is appreciated both for its aesthetics and for its sustainability – is used for the production of caps, among other components. Minelli however believes that it is possible to go further, by using finishing techniques to transform the appearance of wooden components and thanks to innovative materials. At Paris Packaging Week, last month, the Italian group debuted mPackting, their branch dedicated to full packaging solutions for the beauty industry. In collaboration with renowned designer, Thierry de Baschmakoff, mPackting has developed a standard yet luxurious range of skin care jars, lipsticks, compacts, and caps for skincare or perfumes. Dubbed Silva, the range is fully refillable and recyclable. It is made of wood, cork, and of mBlack, Minelli's proprietary biodegradable material derived from wood chips [1]. With universal refill systems, it can be coupled with a virtually infinite number of outer materials such as wood, metal, ceramics, or mBlack. Wood thus proves to be a truly versatile solution as the classic grain and materiality of the product can even disappear from the eye if required. ""The design objective was to make wood disappear, thanks to mPackting's expertise in woodworking and finishing. Everyone must interpret wood differently, as it is a noble material. The secret to luxury lies in the details, that's why we achieved amazing results through customized decoration using different finishing techniques,"" explains Thierry de Baschmakoff. mPackting has collaborated with Italian luxury glass maker Bormioli Luigi to create a premium lipstick with a focus on sustainability and circularity. The packaging is made with a combination of durable and luxurious materials: cap in glass, base in wood, and ring in a 100% biobased and biodegradable biomaterial (could be made from mBlack too). All the components are fully customizable and Tango is refillable and separable for full recyclability. For the release of the new Moon lightweight bottle by Verescence, mPackting has provided its caps based on the LegnaPin concept (wood and cork). LegnaPin is a mono-material cap made with FSC certified wood. Where the traditional plastic insert is replaced by one or three flexible cork pins. This is a universal solution that doesn't require the development of new moulds for each new design. The wood cap also offers the advantage of design flexibility, since it can be machined to any desired shape. mPackting is able to provide components and full packaging for mascaras, lip gloss, lipsticks, eye-shadow, blush and virtually any other beauty applications. Packaging can be made refillable and all parts can be separable or assemblable in one click to avoid any glue. To illustrate this know-how, mPackting is currently developing products with Albéa that will include their bestseller lipstick mechanism, and their mascara offering. Products will be released towards the second half of 2023. ""The vision behind our innovations is to create a luxurious packaging yet sustainable in terms of resources and end-of-life options. Our packaging solutions are made of durable materials by local suppliers, they're refillable and thought for a responsible end-of-life"", comments Paolo Minelli, Director of mPackting.

Lumson launches the new APP LIGHT and the JAPA line,"After closing 2022 with a growth of over 20%, Lumson is ready for new challenges and to connect with industry movers and shakers at MakeUp in Los Angeles 2023 - booth C39. Among the new products that will be presented at the trade show is the 50mL APP LIGHT in PCR PE which further adds to the large family of airless with pouch solutions. 25% lighter than the equivalent standard Lumson APP355 thanks to a reduction in the bottle's thickness, it's also more sustainable due to the materials it is made of (80% PCR HDPE + 20% HDPE). Improvements are also seen in CO2 emissions. From a SPICE analysis (an international platform that measures the sustainability of products and processes) results showed that CO2 emissions generated from the production of APP 355 LIGHT are 19% lower than the APP START (another one of Lumson's airless in PE options). Another ""added bonus"" of this solution is its safety, that is, the guaranteed integrity of the formula it contains. Thanks to a multi-layered pouch that acts as a barrier against external agents and protects the formula from any possible contamination, APP 355 LIGHT is sustainable and safe. To complete the design, the bottle can be combined with the Lumson AA355 pump in PCR PP therefore allowing for the appropriate recycling of the plastic components. At MakeUp in Los Angeles 2023, Lumson will also present two new JAPA jars in a 15mL and 50mL format that enrich the REPLACE line, the family of refillable jars that already includes Unique and Deluxe. A new solution designed for prestige skincare and make-up products. The JAPA jars have an elegant, solid, captivating form, enhanced with an aluminium lid that embodies the values of 'Positive Design'. When we speak about 'Positive Design', we're referring to solutions that are creative and practical to use that combine the principles of a circular economy – Reduce, Reuse, Recycle - and represent the concepts of sustainable design: Re-Think (the packaging has an ECO-design), Re-Gen (refills offer new life to the glass jar), Re-Act (brands and consumers are an active part of the process of reducing environmental impact). The range of REPLACE solutions, an emblem of Positive Design, is also perfect for ""educating"" the final consumer in regards to using products in a more virtuous and informed manner. All of these features are wrapped up in fresh, recognizable, and highly customizable graphics: even the inner cup can be customized with a brand's colors and graphics. Solutions that represent the company's excellence, cutting-edge vision, and attention to sustainability. ""At this edition, we'll be presenting some new products and a variety of 'musts' from our portfolio that share functionality with a sustainable twist as their common denominator. In fact, our goal is to shape the future of packaging with particular attention to the environment and our commitment from hereon out will be to the planning, design, and development of solutions that respect ethical, environmental, and economic sustainability criteria"" - declared the President of Lumson, Matteo Moretti."
"TNT Group, a leading producer of zamak components, accelerates its growth","With 45 employees worldwide and sales of more than USD 52 million. in 2022, TNT Group is now the leader in zamak packaging components for the beauty industry. The company, which created simultaneously in France and Hong Kong by Toby Cattermole and Thomas Diezinger, has succeeded, in less than 10 years, in becoming a key player for luxury brands. ""We have made a name for ourselves in the perfume category and as zamak component specialists. But we are also experts in a variety of materials and we developing very quickly in new categories, with some great achievements in make-up (for Louboutin, Jimmy Choo or Sisley) as well as in skin care for La Mer, for example,"" explains Thomas Diezinger, co-founder. An example of this complex, all-round know-how is the development of the entire perfume project for the leather goods brand ByFar, with its fully customisable packaging at the POS. To sustain this diversification, TNT Group leverages its agility and partnerships with the best manufacturers in their sector. ""We are a 'fabless' company, we produce with selected industrial partners, some of whom are exclusive to us. This is a choice. We don't want to confine ourselves to a particular material or product. Our mission is to produce complex, multi-material designs to meet the requests of our clients. We bring the projects of luxury brands to life by industrialising them,"" continues the manager. TNT Global Manufacturing has chosen not to have a standard range and to focus on specific projects. Depending on requirements, the production of primary packaging and its components (in zamak, stainless steel, aluminium, etc.) can be carried out in Asia and Europe. For promotional packaging and gifts (wooden, paperboard or paper pulp boxes, kits, pouches and bags, wedges), produced by the TNT Promo division, resulting from the acquisition of Promolib in 2020, production mainly takes place in Asia, and a partial reshoring of productions is now underway. As it enters its tenth year in business, the company has high ambitions, with an organic growth target of 10-15% per year for the next five years. In addition to developing its sales in new categories and consolidating its leading position in Europe, TNT Group, which has had a sales office in New York since 2018, intends to speed up its growth in North America. Another development area is the emergence of made-in-China niche perfume brands, with the opening of an office in Shanghai later this year. ""We want to meet the growing demand of local luxury brands, spurred on by a mixture of national pride and the appeal of self-fulfilment and social belonging. This is a segment in which we have strong ambitions,"" warns Thomas Diezinger. Aware of environmental issues and brand commitments focused on sustainability, the company was proactive in creating the very first zamak recovery and recycling channel for perfumes and cosmetics. ""Contrary to popular belief, zamak can be perfectly recycled and there is a well-established recovery channel for this material, thanks to the construction and interior design industries which use large quantities of this material. Yet, to date, the beauty industry had not set up a recovery and sorting system. This is what we initiated in partnership with a retailer and a specialised Belgian company."" In addition to being an injectable metal, zamak is fully recyclable, with no loss of functional or aesthetic quality. This is how TNT Group was able to produce Bulgari's Rose Goldea Blossom Delight collar in recycled zamak. TNT Global Manufacturing also heard its customers' request to relocate some of its production to Europe. Some parts, in plastic or zamak, can thus be made in Portugal or Italy. ""But China remains essential for large volumes and complex assemblies,"" stressed Thomas Diezinger. With its expertise in industrial design, the company also offers its customers various innovations. By recently adapting its patent for a roll-on with a metal head held in place by a magnet on a refill pump bottle, TNT Group has won over a major skincare company, whose product will soon be marketed. ""Demand is high for disruptive designs, which generate buzz on the internet and social networks. Our know-how is perfectly suited to this rapidly growing trend, not only in perfumery but also increasingly in make-up, skincare,"" concludes the entrepreneur.

How are the cost-of-living and environmental crises shaping packaging trends,"""Pressures from the environmental perspective, the conflict in Ukraine, global inflation, social issues, legal challenges, extended producer responsibility, and other forces mean packaging must navigate new and more challenging routes to market,"" explains David Luttenberger, Global Packaging Director at Mintel. Economic uncertainty tops the list of constraints, according to Mintel's Global Packaging Trends report for 2023. According to the market research firm, the rising cost of goods has forced consumers to rethink budgets and discretionary spending. For instance, 40% of Brazilians say the phrase, ""I have a budget that I try to stick to"" describes them well. In this context, ""offering packaging that represents financial value propositions, while not compromising quality, convenience, freshness, safety, and environmental responsibility, will be a differentiator in 2023 and beyond,"" adds Mintel. The environmental crisis is the second key factor impacting packaging since it is changing consumers mindsets and triggering the adoption of new regulations. For instance, 59% of Mexican consumers say the statement, 'I find myself wanting to learn more about brands, social matters, etc.', describes them well. According to Mintel, packaging will therefore become the messenger for socially responsible initiatives and actions. In parallel, new rules around the use of plastics and pollution-causing materials, as well as protecting human and planetary health, will be voted around the world, and consumers will rally behind legislation that benefits the environment. For instance, 45% of Australian consumers rank climate change and global warming among their top three environmental concerns. To get ahead and stay competitive, ""brands must provide climate-friendly consumption choices, and manufacturers must provide packaging alternatives, both of which are easy to understand and actionable for consumers,"" highlights Mintel. Beyond these macro factors that are impacting packaging are across all end-use categories, Mintel's 2023 Global Packaging Trends report also discusses specific trends for different categories, including Beauty and Personal Care. As far as beauty is concerned, it is often left to packaging to communicate the emotional ties the products strive to convey. In a context where consumers are also seeking both social responsibility and value from brands, packaging remains not only a constant but an integral part of the beauty experience. New challenges include eco-responsible structures and materials, 100% product evacuation dispensing systems, messaging about eco-attributes, or messaging about a brand's values. For instance, according to Mintel: – 41% of Brazilian consumers say they prefer to be associated with companies/ brands that align with their values. – 39% of Indian consumers say a beauty/ grooming product with unique/well- designed packaging has triggered them to make an impulse purchase. – 14% of US consumers say they would spend leftover money—after bills and 'needs' were taken care of—on beauty products. ""In parallel with consumers' desire to be more informed, the opportunity to leverage communication between brands and customers to drive engagement has never been greater,"" highlights Mintel. Eventually, the market research firm suggests that companies must create strategies that embrace next-generation package technologies to connect with consumers at retail, at home, and in any/all channels they prefer.

"Heavy Metal, an alternative material to combine luxury and ecodesign","Specialists in plastic injection moulding, Sincoplas wanted to look for alternative solutions. ""We were looking for materials that could be diverted from their primary use and found a solution with a material used in aeronautics to produce complex technical parts"", explains Vincent Gilbert, Sales and Marketing Director of Sincoplas. This innovation combines the advantages of the plastic injection moulding process with the characteristics of metal regarding density, and therefore a certain total weight, cold touch, metallic sound and magnetizability, which makes recycling easier. ""It is a clear alternative to Zamak, which is more difficult to recycle. Thanks to its natural weight, it can also be used without ballast in a cap or a chase,"" says the Director. Even if it is decorated, lacquered, metallized or pad-printed, Sincoplas's Heavy Metal material can be recycled with metals, the company says. ""It offers remarkable engraving fineness, and there are no constraints in terms of shape or size,"" adds Vincent Gilbert. The luxury industry is already interested in this innovation for cosmetics jars and caps, or perfume chases. It should be available on the French market next March.

Dow to produce new grades of sustainable Surlyn in partnership with LVMH,"Dow and LVMH Beauty have announced their intention to collaborate to accelerate the use of sustainable packaging across the LVMH's portfolio of perfume and cosmetic brands. The collaboration aims to enable both bio-based and circular plastics to be integrated into several of the beauty multinational's product applications without compromising functionality or quality of the packaging. Dow's priority is to be able to produce their well-known Surlyn resin in a sustainable way. Surlyn (a copolymer of ethylene and methacrylic acid) is the first ionomer resin that was placed on the market, back in 1964. It is widely used as a coating and packaging material because of its glass-like transparency. It is precisely this requirement for transparency that makes it difficult to use recycled materials to produce it. In 2019, in partnership with Premi, Dow had already presented caps made of 40% Surlyn from post-industrial manufacturing scraps. The material was recovered from industrial plastic waste then crushed prior to being integrated into a new production process. Since the large amount of recycled material used to make the caps prevented reaching the high level of transparency characteristic of Surlyn, these caps had been presented in colourful versions. To overcome this hurdle, Dow turned to an advanced recycling solution in partnership with specialized manufacturers, but also to the use of bio-based feedstock. ""We hope to launch two new grades of sustainable Surlyn by the end of the year: a bio-based grade; and a circular grade created from advanced recycling, without compromising on quality,"" said Shouhaib Mohamed, Marketing Manager, Cosmetic Packaging EMEA at Dow. For the production of bio-based Surlyn, Dow plans to use raw materials such as used cooking oil. According to Dow, only waste residues or by-products from an alternative production process will be utilized, these raw feedstock materials will not consume extra land resources nor compete with the food chain. ""We are committed not to compete with food resources for the production of our polymers"", emphasizes Shouhaib Mohamed. For the circular Surlyn grade, Dow will use advanced recycling technologies to transform mixed plastic wastes that are hard-to-recycle through traditional mechanical processes. These technologies break down waste plastics into their basic chemical elements using heat and pressure, creating raw material that is equivalent to those made from virgin fossil feedstock. This raw material, or circular feedstock, can be used in a wide range of packaging, giving waste that is currently going to landfill or being incinerated a second life. ""We have entered into various partnerships with manufacturers of these recycled materials,"" continues Shouhaib Mohamed. Dow promises these new grades of sustainable Surlyn will deliver similar crystalline transparency and freedom of design expected from the rest of the range. Within 2023, they will be used by LVMH Beauty to lower the carbon footprint of their packaging (mostly perfume caps and cosmetic cream jars). ""At LVMH, with our Life 360 program, we made the decision that our packaging will contain zero plastic from virgin fossil resources in a near future. Collaborating with Dow in developing sustainable Surlyn is key, as this material is used in some of our iconic perfumes, starting with Guerlain La Petite Robe Noire. It is helping LVMH achieve our sustainability targets without any compromise on quality"", said Claude Martinez, Executive President and Managing Director of LVMH Beauty."
Refillable perfume: the new Holy Grail or not such a good idea?,"According to the first figures presented by The NPD Group, consumers are discovering the practice of refilling and some of them have adopted it. Refillable fragrances currently account for 6% of sales in Europe, and refills for 1%. It is a modest share, but it still grew by 31% in 2022, compared to 2021. ""The figures are roughly twice higher in France and twice lower in the US, which reflects a strong cultural and geographical trend variation. But overall, it does correspond to what consumers say about sustainability. They say they are ready to make an effort. There is clearly an appetite for refillable products, and the same goes for brands. This is only logical, because it is THE solution. The ultimate road to reconciling sustainable development and luxury"", explains Gérald Martines. Of all the ecodesign approaches, refilling offers the best potential to reduce the environmental footprint of packaging. As a first approximation, it helps divide the footprint by the number of times a bottle is reused, and therefore appears to be much more efficient than recycling or lightweighting. ""Recycling is essential, and we should definitely use it. But it only recovers 5 to 20% of the environmental impact of the product. Likewise, lightweighting can save a few dozen percent at best. On the contrary, if you refill a bottle, even just twice, you can reduce its impact by three. There is no way other than refill products to gain significant percentages of improvement"", he insists. ""Looking in more detail, this practice offers several advantages in terms of reducing the environmental impact: raw material savings, reduced energy consumption, and therefore reduced CO2 emissions, and reduced waste generation"", he adds. However, reality is quite complex. The first and main obstacle is related to the very foundation of consumer society, which encourages experimentation and hopping from one thing to another. ""There are iconic perfumes with loyal enthusiasts which would be better if they were refillable, and niche brands are also created based on the logic of encouraging loyalty, but on the other end of the spectrum, there is also the hopping perfume, which corresponds to a use, a culture, a desire to experiment. Not all consumers are potential 'refillers', so it is likely there will be market segmentation. I do not think refillable products will become widespread in the short term"", says Gérald Martines. The second, more technical obstacle has to do with distribution. Indeed, the concept raises several logistical problems. ""The most virtuous model is the fountain, because the more bottles you refill, the larger the footprint reduction. However, apart from the fact that it only makes sense in dense urban environments, how can several dozen fountains coexist in the same outlet? Clearly, this system cannot be generalised for now, given the number of existing brands. There is not enough space. Moreover, I think the system is not mature enough, there is still work to be done regarding convenience"", adds the specialist. The individual refills offered to consumers pose a different kind of problem. They involve doubling the number of product units on the shelves, therefore space as well. It is a reality that distributors must understand. ""We are in a period of experimentation. There is a balance to be found between fountains and individual refills, which have the advantage of being very easy to buy online. In addition, to be most advantageous, refills must contain a large volume, 150 ml or 200 ml, which corresponds to several refills – a real commitment for consumers"", he adds. Ultimately, there is an impact on suppliers, and in particular on glass manufacturers who produce bottles, pumps, decorations and accessories. ""They have the most to lose with this practice"", says Gérald Martines. ""The generalisation of refills will have a strong impact on their production. If products are refilled five times, they sell five times less bottles, pumps, and caps, so it is a major loss. Right now, we are only at the beginning: refill sales represent about 1%. So, for now, it does not really make any difference, but it is something suppliers in the perfume industry will not be able to escape in four or five years,"" he adds. To date, the market shares of refillable perfumes remain low, but they are growing rapidly, and launches featuring this solution are becoming more widespread. At the same time, refill sales are still not significant enough to confirm a trend and validate consumer support over time, but the progression is rapid too. ""We are at the beginning of a possible change. It will take a year or two to see things take shape. It is difficult to determine how fast the market will change, and how this share will increase. In my opinion, refillable products could eventually account for a quarter of sales in Western countries, but we will have to adapt"", foresees Gérald Martines."
Inca Packaging relies on its proficiency in aluminium,"A manufacturer of aluminium and plastic primary packaging for perfumes, cosmetics and skin care products since 1951, Inca's history is very much related to the processing of aluminium components. ""We have learnt to shape this material into all possible shapes and sizes, regardless of the quantities required, thanks to the great flexibility of our industrial process,"" says Stefano Parodi, the new CEO. A specialization that the company now considers a huge advantage, due to the 100% and indefinitely recyclable nature of aluminium is a material. The company employs 160 people and achieved a turnover of EUR 20 million in 2022. Inca's production equipment includes twenty transfer presses, two anodizing lines and around fifty assembly machines, as well as ten lines of plastic injection machines. After its acquisition, the company renewed its management while continuing to rely on several historical Inca collaborators, including Alessandra De Giorgi in Sales Department, Giorgio Dianin in Development and Innovation, and Walter Zanzi in Industrial Organization and Supply Chain. ""At the same time, we are going to add to the team new experienced figures, specialized in the industrial transformation of the exclusive aluminium-based products we manufacture,"" adds Stefano Parodi. The new team intends to rely on the company's ""heritage of skills"" and on its industrial tool which makes it possible to offer a ""turnkey"" service from design to the complete production of the packaging component. ""We have expertise in all the stages. We dispose of a wide range of stamping machines, which allow us to shape aluminium into simple or complex forms in small or large batches. We are fully equipped with polishing and brushing machines adapted to work on cylindrical or shaped parts. Our two anodizing lines allow us great flexibility in production and final finishing,"" continues the manager. Inca also incorporates other decoration techniques such as screen printing, pad printing, hot stamping and sublimation. The company also has a fleet of injection moulding machines allowing them to produce any type of plastic components, as well as a wide range of machines capable of assembling together various combinations of materials, whether they are aluminium, plastic or glass. Inca recently produced the series of luxury lids for the Volzhenka brand of caviar made from very pure aluminium, resulting in a very shiny surface. The customer's logo is engraved in relief on the lid and the side is personalized with laser-decorated sturgeons motif. Another launch is Valmont's Luminosity line of skin care products with customized aluminium caps with an embossed logo. The surface is lacquered in pink through the holographic technique, which creates changing reflections depending on the light. Also noteworthy is the decoration by sublimation of the perfume bottles of the Italian brand Carthusia, 50 ml and 100 ml and roll on, for the product Linea A'mmare. At the Paris Packaging Week, Inca showcased a high-end eco-designed, refillable, 100% recyclable aluminium travel spray, decorated with a honeycomb pattern. Inca's teams have also initiated a series of concrete actions in order to improve the production processes so that the impact on the environment is reduced as much as possible: new purification station, replacement of mineral oil by biological oil, optimization of energy consumption. In addition, Inca is working on product design with the use of recycled aluminium (RE-AL), recycled plastics, the development of mono-material packaging and refillable packaging (lipstick with refill and travel spray cover)."
Arcade reduces plastic in their packaging solutions and expands retail offer,"Arcade Beauty continues to innovate with two main goals: the reduction of the environmental footprint of their products and the expansion of their lines of turnkey products in retail sizes. ""The sampling industry has recorded a dramatic transformation over the past few years. Two-dimensional flat formats have largely evolved into much more premium 3D formats. For the group, this involved a huge evolution of our know-how and our technologies,"" explains Carl Allain, the Group's CEO. ""While cheap, mass sampling remains a key tool for global launches, it is now completed by more targeted and more premium campaigns. As a result, the technical difference between sampling and retail products is becoming increasingly thin,"" he adds. Today, Arcade Beauty still generates 80 % of its revenue from the samples sector, compared to 20 % from retail-size products. But this average figure masks important regional disparities for a group that has production units in Europe, China, Brazil, and the United States. Arcade's Brazilian subsidiary, for instance, generates 80 % of its turnover in the manufacture of turnkey products intended for retail sale. For Laurent Oulès, the new General Manager of the Europe branch, this transformation of the business has been made possible thanks to large varieties of in-house technological skills. ""From printing to filling, Arcade Beauty's five European factories are operating within some forty essential technological scopes to produce the full diversity of samples used by the beauty industry. And each year we bring new skills to the group,"" he underlines. Especially since the transformation of samples and packaging continues with the aim of increasing their content in recycled and recyclable materials. ""For many flexible pouches, we are moving to mono-PE solutions. PE is an easily recyclable material, but this shift requires that we adapt our production processes,"" explains Laurent Oulès. Beyond recyclable single-material solutions, Arcade Beauty is also striving to reduce the plastic content in their sampling and packaging solutions, either by using mixed materials containing a portion of paper (flexible pouches with 63% of paper, secondary packaging with 90% of paper), or by developing 100% paper-cardboard solutions (a shift that is facilitated by the rise of anhydrous, solid or powder formulas). At Paris Packaging Week, Arcade presented PaperSnap, an evolution of the EasySnap solution containing 80% paper. Even if it poses technical difficulties in terms of barrier effect and regarding the product's lifespan, the transition to paper is an important step in reducing the environmental footprint, believes Claudie Guérin, Global CSR Director at Arcade Beauty. ""Carbon emissions of flexible pouches made from a material containing a portion of paper are more than 50% lower than those of conventional flexible pouches. On some secondary packaging, adding paper can lead to a reduction by up to 80%,"" she explains. In addition, Arcade Beauty continued to diversify its offering of retail-size products. At the last edition of Paris Packaging Week, Arcade thus presented several scented innovations created within the group's fragrance formulation laboratory in the USA: three new alcohol-free formulas (a Silky Gel, which comes in a bottle with applicator, a Perfume Oil, housed in a dropper pack, Stick-to-Powder cream) and two formulas with alcohol (a Body Mist and a Hair Mist, which both come in pump bottles). ""These formulas, which are fully customizable with the customer's concentrate, are in line with the clean perfumery trend and offer innovative gestures in line with consumer expectations,"" concludes Candice Jagut, VP Marketing, Innovation & Retail, at Arcade Beauty."
Fully redesigned refillable glass airless solutions for Stella McCartney,"Launched in the UK in September 2022, the STELLA by Stella McCartney luxury skincare range is based on a concept of beauty that combines nature, efficiency, and responsibility. The skincare line is made up of three products in various sizes: Reset Cleanser, Alter-Care Serum and Restore Cream moisturizer, with vegan formulas made from at least 99% ingredients from natural origin. The ingredients are 85% traceable down to the country of harvest, and 15% traceable down to the continent. The long-term goal is to trace 100% to the country of harvest. The recyclable and refillable packaging has been eco-designed with the aim of reducing the environmental footprint by at least a third. Bormioli Luigi has responded to the requirement for aesthetical and responsible bottles and jars with a glass made from up to 15% recycled content. In 2023, the brand intends to boost its eco-design efforts. It anticipates using Bormioli Luigi's industrial solutions to offer recycled glass content levels of up to 40%. ""The challenge consisted of guaranteeing the small dimension of the opening and a depth allowing the refill to fit easily into the jar or bottle and the pump to screw on,"" highlights the Italian glassmaker. While the entire packaging has been designed to be refillable, in the case of the Alter-Care Serum and the Restore Moisturizer the refill itself doubles up as a standalone on-the-go product. A dual usage is therefore possible: – The standalone refill can be used separately, equipped with a practical and tight closure for on-the-go use, – The complete pack including the refill within its glass container, together with an airless pump set allowing to dispense the formula up to the last drop. The refills are produced by Texen from a decorated and recyclable multilayer film, ensuring all the barrier effects required for the optimal protection of the new formulas. These refills are made from ISCC+ certified renewable sources – predominantly from wood waste using the mass balance principle. According to the brand, when using the refill inside the glass packaging, the first refill lowers the product's environmental impact by a third; the second refill lowers the impact by half. When the refill is used on its own, the impact on climate change is two-thirds lower. All components are recyclable. When empty, the pouch and cap can be recycled in their respective recycling streams, while the pump kit and bottle or jar can be reused indefinitely."
DB Groupe: Labels to serve the strategy of premium brands,"Labels are a key component of the marketing mix, yet they are not always integrated into the first development phase of new products. ""This is unfortunate, but it is a fact that we have to deal with"", explains Alexandre Burgot-Dervin, President of DB Groupe. ""Our job is to adapt to the design chosen by the brands and to make it industrializable. This involves a wide variety of technical know-how and industrial tools"". The DB Groupe is a family-owned company that has specialized in product identification since 1991. It has two factories in France – one near Rouen, the other near Orléans – organized around three divisions: DB Technique, for industrial marking, DB Tech, for product identification and traceability, and DB Premium for premium labels and markings. The Group employs 70 people and plans to achieve a turnover of 12 million euros in 2023, 50% of which will be generated in the luxury sector (perfumes, cosmetics, wines, spirits, and fine foods). ""The label is a medium that can take many forms and serve many functions. It plays an important aesthetic role, it is a key element of compliance, it is a traceability tool, some serve as a guarantee strip, etc. This multifunctionality requires very different technologies, which must be mastered and adapted to meet multiple demands, in a context where development cycles have become very short"", emphasizes Alexandre Burgot-Dervin. DB Groupe has highly flexible industrial equipment for this purpose. ""Today, we can produce labels by the unit as well as runs of several million, with or without personalization,"" continues the manager. This feat is made possible thanks to the mastery of three major processes: flexography because its high precision is ideal for legal notices; screen printing, the Group's flagship process, which offers the best results in terms of aesthetics (quality of colours, gilding and embossing) but requires extensive know-how; and digital technologies, which are highly complementary to the two others. Different finishes – embossing, relief varnishing, doming – can also be achieved. ""We are convinced that the future will consist of multiprocess labels enabling all customer requirements to be met"", adds Alexandre Burgot-Dervin. DB Groupe is banking on local production and services. The company generates 20% of its turnover abroad, mainly in Europe. Like many others, the company has had to deal with the disruption of supply chains in the post-Covid period. Today, however, DB Groupe believes that it has reached the critical size to offer its customers, storage solutions that guarantee business continuity in the event of logistical problems. The Group is fully participating in the efforts undertaken by all industrial players in Europe, to reduce the environmental footprint. ""We have worked hard on raw materials (paper substrate, adhesives, inks) to offer more environmentally friendly options. We have obtained exclusive innovations from our suppliers for our customers. But the environmental footprint of our actions is not limited to our products. We have to consider the impact of our entire activity"", explains the company's president. DB Groupe is certified Imprim'Vert and ranked Silver by EcoVadis, with the aim of reaching the Gold level as early as 2023, with quantified objectives in terms of reducing energy consumption, recycling waste, and improving the carbon balance… In particular, DB Groupe was a pioneer in offering its customers free take-back of their glassines. ""In terms of volume, this is certainly the main waste generated by labelling. We recover all glassines, whether they come from our factories or not. The paper is then shredded and reused as recycled glassines. The more recycled material there is, the more viable and sustainable the system is, it's a virtuous circle."" Since 2018, DB Groupe, through the DB Foundation, is also committed to funding research into children's diseases, and accompanying hospitalized children. ""What our labels allow us to offer to society is an important part of our raison d'être"", explains Alexandre Burgot-Dervin. To meet the demands of its customers, DB Groupe is investing in new equipment. The company plans to open a new production line every year for the next five years. This equipment will add to the 17 lines already in operation. Naturally, because of these investments, the company's infrastructure will have to be adapted. The Olivet site, in the Loiret region, will be expanded from 2,500 to 4,000 m2. At the same time, construction work will reduce both energy consumption and the carbon footprint of the buildings, while improving recycling rates. Finally, the company is also investing heavily in the search for new talent, their loyalty, and the development of in-house skills. DB Groupe will be taking part in the next edition of the Paris Packaging Week exhibition, on 25 and 26 January 2023 at Paris Expo Porte de Versailles. It will welcome, on its Stand J191, its clients and all brands wishing to study new projects, and present its know-how, its latest achievements and commitments. "" What is the most important is not our labels, it is what they allow you to do,"" concludes the company's president."
"Eviosys: Holographic effects, inclusive packaging, and new product lines","""We are convinced that metal packaging can bring many benefits to the luxury market. Indeed, metal is a noble and high-quality material that makes it possible to create a large number of shapes, decorations and effects,"" says Isabelle Le Graët, Marketing Manager for the Eviosys group. For ever more differentiated products Eviosys has developed, in partnership with Kurz, a hot stamping technique with unique holographic effects. ""Based on a industrial process that is unique in Europe, this technique makes it possible to create original colour reflection effects and 3D illusions,"" Isabelle Le Graët tells Premium Beauty News. Using micro-embossing technology to produce high-precision decorations directly on metal surfaces, Eviosys suggests to create Braille markings allowing visually impaired consumers to easily locate a QR code that would refer to an audio description or vocal directions for use. At Paris Packaging Week, Eviosys will also introduce three ""ready to launch"" lines designed on the basis of three trends spotted by French trend agency Caramel: – Pebbles, a line inspired by the ""regeneration"" trend, with shapes that are reminiscent of pebbles, to meet the expectations of consumers seeking to get closer to nature. – Iron Bar, a line inspired by the ""industrial romance"" trend. To meet the expectations of consumers who want meaningful purchases and noble materials, the range features ingot-shaped products. – Sweet Tooth, a line inspired by the ""little pleasures"" trend and whose nesting boxes allow multiple combinations and an evocation of the joys of childhood. Visitors to the show will also be able to test 3D designs with My Tin, a new interactive catalogue that allows you to customize Eviosys' promotional packaging tins and visualise the result instantly, thus simplifying the development process and reducing the time to market. ""My Tin helps save valuable time by testing different shapes before moving on to the finishing stage. Of course, our design office can finalize the details at any time upon customer request,"" details the marketing manager. A major European player in steel aerosol cans, Eviosys also took inspiration from the trends identified by Caramel, to imagine a graphic universe combining the circularity of steel with innovative and ultra-differentiating designs. ""Steel and tinplate, which are the basis of our various packaging solutions, are infinitely recyclable materials and they are perfectly recycled in Europe. In addition, a metal packaging is a beautiful object in itself, which is an integral part of the gift. A real advantage for the luxury goods market that seeks to get rid of plastic,"" concludes Isabelle Le Graët."
GPA acquires Cosfibel and emerges as a global player in luxury packaging,"More than four years of talks were necessary before finalizing the operation, which is now closed: Cosfibel is joining North America's GPA to form a global leader in secondary packaging for the premium and luxury markets. ""We started our discussions even before the pandemic,"" says Adam Melton, co-founder and CEO of GPA Global to Premium Beauty News. ""Cosfibel and founder Alain Chevassus are renowned for their work with premium and high-luxury brands, and we wanted to be sure to fully understand their vision for the company's transition to the next step"". Created in 2001 by Alain Chevassus, the Cosfibel group is one of the leading players in luxury promotional packaging, luxury gifting, and merchandising solutions. From L'Oréal to Chanel, LVMH to Remy Martin, and La Durée to Damman, Cosfibel has many prestigious clients and has established itself as one of the world's most acclaimed suppliers. Based in France, with global service centres in 16 locations, and working across verticals such as beauty and personal care, wine and spirits, and fine foods, Cosfibel employs more than 200 staffs and operates four manufacturing facilities in Spain, Portugal and Belgium. In 2022, the company achieved a turnover of around 100 million euros. This latest acquisition, which comes hot-on-the-heels of the take-over of Jenco Productions in North America, sees GPA establish itself as a global leader in luxury packaging. It also furthers their strategy for nearshore and onshore manufacturing, creating a strong European foothold through Cosfibel's key manufacturing and to the facilities previously acquired, in particular in Poland (ASG), and in the UK and Ireland (Lucas Luxury Packaging). ""Our vision is to be as close as possible to our customers through regional packaging solutions. With this acquisition we can now produce in Europe for European customers, in North America for Americans and in China for Asian customers,"" continues Adam Melton. ""Our global supply chain and manufacturing capabilities will enable us to better support Cosfibel's customers and increases our prominence in the beauty and food sector, whilst growing our dominance in wine & spirits. In terms of geography, the addition of France is a perfect piece of the puzzle that was missing to our European footprint. The acquisition of Cosfibelalso helps to grow our rigid packaging offering and to strengthen in the beauty segment."" This move is key to GPA's strategy of helping clients to reduce carbon emissions and shorten supply chains for speed-to-market, with better use of capital, while at the same time helping to de-risk the supply of materials. Reducing the environmental footprint of packaging is, actually, the other key focus of the operation. The two entities intend to pool their respective expertise in this field, whether in terms of design or materials science. ""By joining GPA, Cosfibel will provide its customers an even more thorough global service. The two companies are very complementary, both geographically and in terms of products. The synergies will be incredible, across all verticals and segments,"" highlights Marie Sermadiras, CEO of Cosfibel. ""The complementarity of GPA and Cosfibel's know-hows, creativity and excellence in execution should enable us to grow even quicker, accelerate our diversification and foster the transformation of the pack & gift sector. I am convinced that we are in the best possible position to lead the consolidation of the luxury and premium packaging industry in the next years"" The integration of new entities is a well-oiled process for GPA, which has been built up through successive acquisitions since its creation by Tom Wang and Adam Melton in 2007. The founder of Cosfibel, Alain Chevassus, will assist in the transition process as Senior Advisor, while Marie Sermadiras, the current Managing Director, joins GPA'sexecutive committee. ""This is an historic moment for GPA, we have single-mindedly sought out the best talent, no matter where it was in the world, to enhance our GPA community and create a high-touch, consultative service model for the businesses we work with. Our ambition with each acquisition is to help our new partners to grow with us. This is a goal that we fully share with Ontario Teachers, our financial partner,"" concludes Adam Melton. GPA Global is headquartered in the USA and employs more than 3,000 people globally. The company is established on three continents in 38 sites."
Knoll Packaging debuts 100% molded pulp make-up compacts,"Knoll Packaging has introduced a series of patent-pending make-up compacts made from 100% Knoll Ecoform molded pulp, a plant material made from bamboo, wood and sugar cane fibers, which can be used as an alternative to thermoformed plastics. These fully customizable designs feature magnet free closure and - potentially - a removable mirror. The new application required over one year of research and development to launch onto the market. Customization options include embossing and stamping or added FSC paper mask for additional decoration. ""The Knoll Ecoform molded pulp compact continues Knoll's mission to create a better world through design innovation and deepens its commitment to eliminate plastics from its supply chain,"" says the company in a statement. Knoll Packaging aims to eliminate 200 metric tons of plastic from its supply chain by Summer 2023. Knoll Packaging introduced Knoll Ecoform onto the market over 5 years ago to eliminate plastics and drive positive change in the packaging industry. The material is certified recyclable in the paper recycling stream, and can be molded, cut to order and color matched. From this launch, Knoll has worked with the world's leading brands to implement the sustainable material and push its boundaries to new limits with 100% pulp packaging solutions. Last year, the company partnered with French luxury powerhouse Chanel to create an-awarding winning packaging for an advent calendar dedicated to the brand's N°5 line. ""The launch of our Knoll Ecoform molded pulp compacts pushes the boundaries of this sustainable material to new heights. Our Knoll Ecoform pulp compact took over 1 year to develop to ensure it has the highest level of quality and design to satisfy the luxury market. The configurations are limitless, and the material can be color matched to align with a brands DNA. In 2023, we will see brands adapting this for their own use, as well as implementing Knoll Ecoform for make-up refills. Knoll Ecoform has become one of the most in-demand material at Knoll, and this latest innovation has the possibility to transform the make-up sector into a more sustainable future,"" said Benjamin Cohen, Creative and Innovation Director at Knoll Packaging. In 2022, Knoll formed a partnership agreement with Albertini Packaging for the regionalization of a part of their production from Asia into Europe, and recently began offering European production of its Knoll Ecoform molded pulp. The packaging supplier also diversified its Asian supply sources with the opening of a fully owned and operated factory in the Philippines."

Aptar Beauty + Home adapts its packaging offer to e-commerce requirements,"With the increase in online sales for cosmetic and personal care products, the demand for packaging solutions adapted to the requirements of omnichannel retail is becoming massive. ""Consumers expect a seamless shopping experience across multiple channels from in-store, to click & collect, to online. According to our research [1] leaking in transit is the biggest pain point consumers currently face. These innovative dispensing solutions are designed to eliminate that pain point for consumers and improve consumer sentiment for our brand partners,"" said Xavier Joseph, Vice President, Global Marketing & Innovation, Aptar Beauty + Home. ""We have taken a three-pronged approach to meet this demand,"" explained Luigi Garofalo, Global Business Development Director, Aptar Beauty + Home. ""Our first step was to adapt our existing product range for requirements specific to e-commerce needs, including adding clips and increasing the robustness of pumps that are prone to breaking while in transit. Meanwhile, our talented engineers were working on ways to integrate e-commerce features into the functional design of packaging while simultaneously rethinking our omnichannel approach: deliver superior technical design, optimize the consumer experience across e-commerce and in-store channels, and minimize environmental impact."" The initial phase of this development included 40 products in Aptar Beauty + Home's catalog deemed ""e-commerce capable"" and were ISTA-6 certified - the standard implemented by Amazon, in partnership with the International Safe Transit Association (ISTA) to ensure products withstand transport and distribution network pressures. In 2022, Aptar Beauty + Home increased that total by 50%. Among these solutions let's mention: – Disc Top Go, the first disc top in the market designed specifically for omnichannel distribution packaging needs, with a built-in twist to lock ring that prevents leakage or accidental actuation while in transit. – E-Simplicity, a flip top closure that features an integrated tamper evident tear band. – Quickflip, an e-commerce capable HDPE pouch spout for flexible packaging with a tamper evident feature and the patented SimpliSqueeze valve for controlled dispensing and clean cut-off. – Future, a mono-material and fully recyclable dispensing pump, which is e-commerce capable thanks to an integrated lock/unlock ring and a 360° free-rotating actuator to minimize the risk of breakage during transport. – Hiflow e-commerce, a large dosage dispensing pump designed specifically to address omnichannel distribution challenges. The actuator design helps reduce the risk of breakage, and features a lock-down system to prevent actuation during transport. ""We have been working to inform and inspire brands to use these solutions to both simplify their fulfilment process and deliver more sustainable, recyclable packaging to consumers,"" added Luigi Garofalo According to Aptar Beauty + Home, the benefits of omnichannel packaging solutions must also help brands to work towards their own circular economy goals. Aptar's public sustainability product commitments are aligned with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's New Plastics Economy, which includes developing dispensing solutions that are recyclable, reusable, or integrate recycled resin. ""Our innovative approach of how to make products more sustainable and omnichannel capable at the same time ensures we are eliminating excessive or unnecessary packaging components from the waste stream,"" says Xavier Joseph, ""it is critical for all packaging suppliers to look broader than just one or two 'sustainable' features and truly understand the holistic impact we can make for the future."" An example of this is Aptar Beauty + Home's award-winning Future, a recyclable, mono-material and e-commerce capable pump. ""This pump is truly a game-changer in bringing recyclability to the next level and fully addressing the need for mono-material packaging. We chose Future because of this and took it one step further by pairing it with a bottle made of 50% post-consumer recycled resin (PCR). In addition to the sustainability features, this pump's e-commerce-friendly design is equally important to our brand since we ship high volumes via small parcel,"" commented Kevin Davis, Packaging Engineering Director at Dermalogica, one of the first brand to have opted for this solution."
Fedrigoni: six purchases for the benefit of the luxury world,"""Despite the turbulence on raw material markets and the much increased costs of all production factors, which jeopardized many segments, we will achieve a turnover exceeding 2.1 billion euros at the end of the year, with an EBITDA of more than 300,000 million"", highlighted Marco Nespolo, CEO of the Fedrigoni group, at the press conference held in Paris on November 18, 2022. Nespolo also made the group's latest purchase official: French paper company Zuber Rieder. In the third quarter 2022, Fedrigoni's turnover reached 547 million euros, i.e. +36% compared to the third quarter 2021. Of course, the group's growth is related to the purchases in strategic geographical and industrial hubs, which played a key role, but also to Fedrigoni's transformative sustainable strategy. The latest purchase is not the least: Zuber Rieder, ""a French gem specialized in high quality paper for label fronts and luxury packaging"", explains Nespolo. In October, the group purchased Guarro Casas, a Spanish company specialized in high-end paper. In September, Fedrigoni signed a contract in the US with American company Mohawk, to extend its presence on the North-American continent. Earlier, in July, the group was in Turkey to purchase Unifol, a company which makes self-adhesive materials for vehicle wrapping. In March, it was the French Montpellier-based company Tageos which was purchased: an expert of smart labels and radio-identification – usually called RFID, for Radio Frequency Identification. Ultimately, last February, self-adhesives Spanish company Divipa also joined the group. Thanks to this external growth, the Fedrigoni group asserts its leadership on the luxury packaging and labelling markets, including the French, for cosmetics, fashion, wine and spirits players, but also on other, new segments like the food, household, and hygiene product industries. Right now, Fedrigoni's industrial park counts eleven production sites, 29 sales offices, and almost 20 machines of various sizes, only for the paper division. ""This considerable number of machines makes us extremely agile and definitely shortens our delivery times, even for special, tailor-made products,"" says Nespolo. ""Right now, it is a much valuable argument, in particular in the luxury world, where demand varies a lot,"" he adds. Last June, Fedrigoni received a platinum medal from global agency Ecovadis: the group was ranked in the top 1% of companies in this segment on the global level, which emphasizes its commitment for sustainability. ""As a company with high energy consumption, the trickiest task is to reduce CO2 emissions. Our ESG roadmap for 2030 includes the following objectives: reduce emissions by 30%, restore over 95% of clean water in the environment (we have already reached 97%), and upgrade 100% of our waste for full circularity (we have already reached 89%). In addition, by 2030, we will only make fully recyclable products"", explains Nespolo."
Inessens makes its mark in the cosmetics and perfumes industry,"In 2019, the Inessens group purchased four printing companies specialized in labels and cases for cosmetics and perfumes. Since then, it has decided to leverage its pool of know-how to try and meet the beauty market's expectations. ""It helped us acquire different techniques and develop a comprehensive offering of standard labels, cases, sets, fragrance strips, and perfume cards for a global secondary pack service"", explains the group's Marketing Director, Christelle Dubois. Praised for its capacity to innovate, Inessens aims to broaden its catalogue with new premium solutions compliant with an eco-design approach. ""We want to offer our customers techniques that will help them stand out with their package design"", she adds. The innovation is conveyed by new ranges of materials, like velvet, wood, cork, moiré or natural canvas, suede, silk… and a blend of techniques like label layering for more volume and creativity. Meeting with the supplier of the Wet & See ink helped Inessens offer innovative and creative fragrance strip solutions. The ink becomes transparent in contact with water or with the sprayed perfume to reveal the printed decoration underneath. This process is reversible in just a few minutes. In addition, the company developed a collection of sixteen inks based on natural pigments from minerals and plants. The pastel shades of the collection are meant to be completed with new colours, whose light resistance is being tested. ""We have been working on more responsible labelling solutions for over three years, and there is actually a craze for our inks based on natural pigments. They meet a high demand for eco-designed packs,"" says Christelle Dubois. Since the range has been launched, more than two million labels have been printed with these inks. And for an even stronger offering, the company also supports its customers with a short guide on the ten eco-design steps. ""Eco-design does not merely consist in choosing a biosourced material or a more natural ink. It is a holistic, comprehensive concept which, for example, is also aimed to reduce a label size by one millimetre to optimize the roll width for less paper or hot stamping waste,"" explains the Director. The company is led by eight worker-shareholders. It counts 280 employees over the nine printing plants and achieved a 57-million turnover in 2021, 20% of which was in the cosmetics and perfumes industry. It aims to reach 100 million by 2025. ""Inessens intends to broaden its skills and focus its efforts on its multiple, cross-industry know-how. So, there will be new purchases, but always with the customer service in mind, as we are willing to be present in French regions where we have not settled yet, to be closer to our customers,"" concludes Christelle Dubois."
Aptar Beauty + Home expands the production of its Essencia fragrance pumps,"Enriched by new variations addressing consumer demands for premiumization and sustainability, Aptar Beauty + Home's Essencia range is now available on a global scale, with manufacturing and customization facilities in Europe, but also in the Americas and Asia to ensure optimal lead times, agility and scalability. ""The masstige market has its own specificities. Fragrance brands in this segment need accessible, more sustainable solutions with premium aesthetics. Essencia is inspired by prestige contemporary codes, driven by sustainability and empowered by best-in- class technical and design expertise. A robust industrial footprint allows us to deliver this essential solution to brands around the world,"" explains Xavier Joseph, Vice President, Global Marketing and Innovation, Aptar Beauty + Home.

Optimized for in-store or at-home refilling, an inner plastic ring ensures a pleasant and silent unscrewing gesture. At the end of its life, the pump can be recycled together with the glass bottle, for ease of recycling. – ESSENCIA SLP (SUPER LOW PROFILE) is a small, discreet spray. SLP's low profile enhances subtle fragrance packaging designs. – ESSENCIA ON-THE-GO is a portable essential. Designed for 10 and 15ml bottles, this slim, elegant pump is the perfect companion for on-the-go fragrance packaging. Essencia's design and finishing is adaptable to any brand image - tailored solutions can be created with custom features and decoration on the collar, actuator and cap."
kdc/one and HCT are bringing Pumpart System's tube innovation to North America,"Tubeasy™ delivers an upgrade to traditional tubes and jars at a lower cost than airless bottles. Tubeasy™ easily dispenses thick formulas and provides superior evacuation performance across the board. When compared to jars, Tubeasy™ is a safer, more hygienic solution. When compared to pumps and airless bottles that get blocked or deactivated early, Tubeasy™ is a more sustainable solution. ""We have replaced a traditional multimaterial pump with a lightweight soft PE pouch inside the tube that works as a piston and a protective shield avoiding contact with air,"" says Xavier Sutty, CEO, PumpArt System. The value Tubeasy™ brings to the consumer experience is exponential: 25% more product, longer lasting freshness of formula, an instant dose with each squeeze, the ability to use the tube in all positions (even upside down!), easier to empty, and always looks good on the shelf. For brands, Tubeasy™ is a great solution – reducing environmental impact, as well as over-filling. It also maintains its shape and allows for better branding moments. Its ease of use in the filling process significantly increases flexibility in which fulfillment can occur. ""Brands can offer to their clients a unique experience using a tube that really supports the beauty ritual. There is no longer a need to fight with a tube or even cut it to get those precious last doses,"" added Xavier Sutty. Tubeasy™ is filled through the top, like a bottle with the bottom already sealed. This process ensures that less air can be trapped inside after filling – similar to an airless bottle or tottle, but unlike regular tubes that leave 20% empty space inside after filling. The innovative package is ideal for viscous formulations often found in masks, exfoliators, scrubs, creams, and gels. The Tubeasy™ system has been designed to improve ease-of-use while providing an eco-friendlier solution. The monomaterial PE design allows for the pack to be 5x lighter than a traditional component comprised of multiple materials and uses less energy to produce. PE is one of the most recycled plastics in the world and is fully compatible with the current HDPE recycling stream. ""Sustainability is quickly becoming a 'must-have' instead of a 'nice-to-have' in any new product launch, the Tubeasy™ system provides an attractive, and environmentally friendly option that uniquely provides improved performance as well as responsible packaging,"" said Brad Weinberg, Chief Strategy Officer, kdc/one. A soft plastic pouch is inserted into the standard plastic tube separating the volume into two parts with the upper chamber containing the product and the lower chamber with air. A flexible film acts as a valve closing the blowhole and controlling airflow and forcing it to act as a piston forcing out product. The blowhole opens once pressure is released and allows air to flow back into the lower chamber effectively reloading the 'piston', ready for the next dose. Customers have sustainable options with Tubeasy™; in addition to the monomaterial PE version, the component is also available with the inclusion of PCR material, bio-based resin, or cardboard for different sustainability stories. HCT and kdc/one are the sole providers of this technology in the U.S. and complements HCT's expansive, stock tool catalogue. HCT proactively strives to create innovative sustainable packaging solutions that are refillable, incorporate eco-friendly materials, or are easier to recycle, and Tubeasy™ is exactly that. HCT by kdc/one is a global leader in formulation and packaging innovation, offering end-to-end full turnkey solutions that increase speed-to-market. An integrated team of renowned experts in packaging, formulation, brushes, accessories, and devices are available to guide customers through the entire design and development process from concept to final product. As a part of the kdc/one network, HCT is backed by the teams and resources of a trusted, global solutions provider in the beauty, personal care, and home care categories. kdc/one has 28 manufacturing facilities, 26 R&D facilities, 4 innovation hubs, and nearly 15,000 employees throughout the Americas, Europe, and Asia delivering solutions on a global scale."
"Plastic packaging commitments are falling short of goals, report finds","The commitment to use only reusable, recyclable, or compostable plastic packaging by 2025 will likely not be met, according to the latest New Plastics Economy Global Commitment progress report. While measurable progress is being made, ""a lack of investment in collection and recycling infrastructure means the 100% reusable, recyclable, or compostable plastic packaging by 2025 target is becoming unattainable for most signatory businesses,"" the report notes. According to the report, the use of recycled content in plastic packaging continues to rise strongly, having doubled in the past three years. The share of post-consumer recycled content has risen from 4.8% in 2018 to 10.0% in 2021. Whilst it took decades for businesses to hit the 5% mark, signatories to the Global Commitment doubled it to 10% in just three years. However, while over half (59%) of business signatories have cut their use of virgin plastics since 2018, the overall use among the group increased in 2021 back to 2018 levels. Even worse, the report also shows a decline in the share of reused packaging. Yet, reduction and reuse are recognized as the most relevant solutions to act effectively against plastic pollution. ""The reason some businesses have not hit peak virgin plastic is due to increases in their total plastic packaging use. This reinforces the need for businesses to decouple growth from the use of plastic packaging,"" says the report. For instance, 42% of signatories have yet to introduce any reuse models into their packaging strategies. The report shows that many businesses have been investing in ways to achieve 100% technical recyclability for rigid plastic packaging, but the benefit of this investment is being stifled by inadequate collection and sorting infrastructure around the world. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation therefore call on brands to adopt ambitious strategies to scale up reuse schemes, innovate away from flexible plastic packaging where possible, and reduce their use of single-use packaging. ""Recycling alone is not sufficient to stop the flow of plastic pollution,"" insists the Foundation. For their part, in the context of the possible adoption of an international, legally binding instrument to tackle the plastic crisis a significant acceleration of policy efforts is needed from governments. ""The transparency provided by the Global Commitment helps us understand how large the gap is that we still need to fill. It is clear that big challenges remain,"" concludes Inger Andersen, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme. Supported by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the United Nations Environment Programme, The New Plastics Economy Global Commitment has brought together more than 500 organizations, which represent 20% of all plastic packaging produced in the world."
Berry Global launches a new recyclable 2cc lock-up dispenser,"Berry Global has become one of the first packaging manufacturers to develop a recyclable lock-up 2cc dispenser. The new Berry Wave2cc, a product of the Company's B Circular range, was designed to meet current market demands for more sustainable packaging solutions, including popular pump formats that are widely used for a variety of personal care products including liquid soaps, body lotions, body milks, shampoos, conditioners and hair treatments. The Berry Wave2cc is made from 100% polyolefin, with no metal parts, which makes the dispenser recyclable when paired with a PET bottle where appropriate facilities exist. This has gained the Wave2cc a RecyClass A rating. It will also be available containing up to 50% post-consumer recycled (PCR) material [1]. ""Circular innovation plays a fundamental role in delivering the sustainable and versatile dispensing solutions our customers demand. We are proud of our new Wave global platform. Our significant investment will sustain our global leadership in circular dispensers meeting local needs across our global manufacturing footprint,"" said Jean-Marc Galvez, President, Consumer Packaging International (CPI) Division at Berry Global. A further advantage of the dispenser's innovative design is that Berry was able to reduce the number of components to just eight, compared to the 12 to 14 components that are typically found in other versions. Alongside these improved sustainability benefits, the Berry Wave2cc offers high flexibility and adaptability for manufacturers. In particular, the robust design of the Wave2cc means it is able to handle even the most viscous formulations, such as hair conditioners, to ensure consistent, reliable and accurate dosing of all product types. The flexible design of the Wave2cc also means it can be adapted to different actuator styles and closure sizes. For brand owners, these benefits make the Wave2cc a real multifunctional solution, which can be used across their entire product ranges, thereby significantly simplifying supply chains and providing economies of scale. It can also be noted that the Wave2cc's locking system has the ability to operate in both clockwise and anti-clockwise directions. This provides added convenience for consumers while giving the dispenser greater flexibility in meeting the requirements of different filling lines. Last but not least, for the growing personal care e-commerce market, the new Berry Wave2cc has achieved the ISTA6 certification [2] when combined with Berry's wide range of stock bottles in 200ml, 250ml, 500ml and 1 litre sizes. The new dispenser will be available from the end of 2022. The 2cc size is the first in Berry's new Wave atmospheric dispenser platform, with 3cc, 4cc and 0.25ml versions to be launched in the future. Berry expects to invest over $100 million in the coming years in manufacturing capabilities throughout its global operations in order to provide localised supply to meet the identified demand from both national and international customers. ""This significant investment in our new Wave platform demonstrates our global design and engineering expertise in the development of products that meet the latest consumer and market requirements. In particular, as part of our B Circular initiative, it underlines our commitment to create packaging solutions that maximise the many benefits of plastics while ensuring the packages can also play a valuable role in the circular economy. In this way, we help our customers to meet and exceed their sustainability goals,"" concluded Vincent Clauzel, Head of Berry CPI Care, responsible for the Dispensing, Closures and Healthcare markets."
Arcade Beauty Carestia creates innovative eco-friendly fragrance diffusers,"Arcade Beauty Carestia introduces a new generation of environmentally friendly solutions is made of recyclable cardboard and cork from industrial waste, two materials that have the advantage of a low-carbon footprint. Two concepts have been developed to date, one to perfume the car interior (ScentLy-Car), the other for the home (ScentLy-Home). The ScentLy-Car concept has been designed to diffuse a scent throughout the day. Arcade Beauty Carestia can use a brand's fragrance oil or can offer a turnkey solution, with a specific range of scents that are compatible with cork and remain biodegradable. Performance tests were carried out to guarantee excellent rendition of the fragrance and an equal diffusion power over a period of 3 weeks. ScentLy-Home is a home-fragrance diffuser that comes in the form of a 100% customizable box (that can be round, square, rectangular or hexagonal shaped). The fragrance is released through an impregnated piece of corkwood lodged inside the box. According to Carestia, these two innovations can be fragranced and customized as needed. They allow consumers to discover a fragrance and diffuse a scent throughout the day. ""With a quick turnaround time, they are real sources of creativity (shapes, sizes, deco, die cuts, etc.),"" said the Arcade Beauty subsidiary."
Embelia introduces a refillable version of the Baia pouch airless system,"Presented at the last edition of the Luxe Pack Monaco trade show, the refillable version of the Baia pouch airless bottle is part of the generalization of sustainable development initiatives within the cosmetics industry. Co-developed with Lablabo, a specialist in pouch airless packaging solutions, the Baia airless bottle is particularly suitable for delicate formulas that are increasingly common in the cosmetics and personal care industries. Entirely manufactured and assembled in France, the Baia airless is a complete set consisting of a 30 or 50 ml recyclable polypropylene (PP) bottle, a recyclable polyethylene (PE) pouch, a pump allowing the distribution of high viscosity formulas, a collar and a cap. The flexible pouch retracts with each dose delivered. There is therefore no air return into the system, which helps to protect the integrity of the formula and to limit the total amount of preservatives needed. The pouch also allows an optimal restitution of the product, up to 95% depending on the formula, and therefore helps to reduce waste. For the refillable version, an ultra-simple gesture has been developed. After use, the pouch can be easily removed by unscrewing the upper part of the system. The user can then insert a refill and reuse the rest of the the system, i.e. the bottle, the collar, the cap and the pump. ""The pouch is the only part to be discarded after use, which limits the environmental footprint of the Baia airless and represents an economical gain from the second use,"" says Embelia. A plastic or aluminium lid can be heat sealed on the refill. Beyond being refillable, the Baia airless bottle offers several environmental benefits: the size of the bottle has been optimized to minimize its weight, some lines can be produced with recycled materials and all the components are recyclable in the most common sorting channels. Many customization options are avaialble such as silk-screening, pad printing, hot stamping, coloration of the bottle, etc."
Quadpack opens German decoration centre to shorten lead times in Europe,"Already a centre of excellence for PET injection and airless packaging manufacture, the factory now boasts a 900m2 facility with five high-capacity decorating lines and eleven assembly machines. The facility is part of Quadpack's strategic plans to become a leader in decoration in the industry, following the acquisition of Wicklein Kunststoffveredelung GmbH in October 2021. The increase in assets and know-how, along with a significant investment in the Kierspe plant, means that it now offers an extensive range of decorating services. The new facility should help the company to streamline manufacture and shorten lead times through décor operations in Europe. As of today, the new decoration and assembly lines allow Quadpack to finish proprietary and bespoke solutions manufactured at the plant, for a fully streamlined workflow. ""The new decoration centre positions the Kierspe plant as a European leader in sustainable manufacture and decoration. Our increased decoration capability allows us to bring in-house a service that was previously outsourced. In doing so, we will be able to speed up delivery times and cut carbon footprint of our 'Made in Europe' solutions,"" said Ernesto Cara, Head of Industrial Process at Quadpack. A reduction of up to 50% in average lead times for finished packs is expected at the Kierspe plant, according to the company's forecasts. Early projections estimate an annual saving of 170 tonnes of CO2 emissions. About EUR 1 million has been invested in the creation of the decoration centre, stated Quadpack. The site is supported by a four-tonne metal structure to create an open space with room to expand. A climate control system and air filters create the ideal conditions for decoration. The centre is staffed by 36 employees, with specialist training in decorating techniques. With the new centre, Quadpack's in-house decoration services in Europe now include silk-screening, hot-stamping, pad printing, metallisation, colour matching, digital printing and laser etching, with new techniques soon to be included. Quadpack plans to add more machines in the next months, totalling 10 decoration lines and 14 assembly machines. Earlier this year, Quadpack had announced a EUR 6 million investment in order to expand the injection-moulding and assembly capacity of manufacturing facility in Kierspe. The opening of the centre conforms with the company's operational strategy to deliver solutions as close as possible from its customers. Quadpack's plant in Dallas, Texas, for instance, also has decoration capabilities, as well as lab testing capabilities."
Decoration: Reducing the impact of packaging with bio-sourced products,"The new varnish solutions developed by Altus Coating's Research & Development laboratory have been designed to enhance glass, aluminium and even wood packaging while minimizing energy consumption, the use of solvents, or the emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC). These products do not prevent packaging recycling and have been developed to meet at least one of the following criteria: to contain no more than 10% volatile organic compounds, to contain at least 10% bio-sourced substances, to be dried under LED lamps. Altus Coating thus offers a multitude of finishes and properties (gloss, matt, colourless, opaque, ""frosted"", unbreakable glass and metallic finishes) for glass. For instance, the Alcoat range, a single coat water- based thermal drying solution, allows substantial savings in terms of energy consumption, thanks to its reticulation process. The Alcure and Allux ranges propose can be applied directly to the glass with no solvent- based adhesion primer. This eliminates the need for an oven and its huge energy requirements, while also limiting VOC emissions. In addition, new water-based solutions that are still under development will soon be offering a phenomenal reduction in energy requirements to meet even more stringent criteria. As far as wood is concerned, Altus Coating offers a solvent-based UV solution that does not penetrate the substrate and considerably reduces the amount of product required and VOC emissions, combined with UV reticulation to limit energy consumption and preserve the substrate. For aluminium, the company showcased a water-based thermal solution like that developed for glass. This solvent-based UV solution offers the same advantages as the one developed for glass, with the addition of resistance properties required for the various stages of substrate shaping With these new solutions, Altus Coating has won the Luxe Pack in Green 2022 Award in the ""Corporate Social Responsibility approach"" category at Luxe Pack Monaco. Altus Coating's application highlighted their achievements in combining CSR policy and innovation, since their creation in 2007, as well as their decision to be evaluated very early in alignment with their most demanding customers. In 2021, Altus Coating thus received the Platinum medal from EcoVadis -the world's most trusted organization for CSR evaluations- thus ranking in the Top 1% of its professional category."
Luxe Pack Monaco 2022: Premium packaging is undergoing a transition,"The ecological transition in luxury packaging is getting structured around various eco-design solutions which, given the innovations showcased, are mainly based on more responsible materials, refill solutions, new consumer gestures, and adaptability. Despite all these efforts, no compromise was made on the search for gestures and high-end sensorial effects. The solutions offered included highly convenient and easily recyclable refills for new product categories. Perfumes, skincare, makeup… refillable containers can now come in multiple forms. At Qualipac (Groupe Pochet), the refill option is embodied by the new jar called Malti, which combines a choice of recyclable and upcycled materials – wood, glass, aluminium – to customize the cap, the cup, and even the jar, thanks to a removable plastic interface. To highlight innovation in this field, Stoelzle worked on a refillable glass jar, Perpetuel, whose refill system was co-developed with Technicaps. The glassmaker also put forward this concept with a collection of ten refillable bottles created for the Dries Van Noten eaux de parfum, which feature a unique unscrewing system with an invisible closing mechanism. A special key is provided with the refill bottle to unlock the pump. Heinz Glas focused on glass for the case, and even for the cup, with a concept called All4One fully based on this material. The jar contains four interchangeable inserts, depending on the application or the formula chosen (perfume, lotion, emulsion, foundation…). This concept suits transparent glass, PCR, and coloured or opal shades. In the skincare category, Albéa showcased Twirl, a refillable cosmetics jar with a convenient, intuitive system designed to simplify the gesture. Aptar's premium airless solution Gaia has also been enhanced with a new refill device. The cartridge is ejected from the bottom to make the refill process fast and intuitive. At LabLabo, the Baïa Refill collection offers a solution of refillable airless glass bottles with a PE or aluminium pouch. Once they have been separated, the different elements can be recycled. Glass was also used in a few airless solutions, like that of Berlin Packaging Premi Industries, Airglass Jar, a new refillable airless system with an innovative mechanism. It only takes consumers a few simple steps to refill the jar, thanks to a removable glass jar which can be filled in with a convenient PP bottle. To make new solid formulas even more sustainable, Superga Beauty chose the mono-material refillable packaging Stick ReUse by Cosmogen for the Hyalustick Serum, an anti-ageing skincare stick solution. Cosmogen has also been working on its applicator offering to facilitate reuse. The very popular Tense tube is fitted with a Zamak massaging applicator which can be removed and reused on a new refill tube. Five new versions of these removable tips are now available for new sensations and effects (decongestion, smoothing, relaxation…). Likewise, Fresh ReUse, which is made of a tube and a screwed metal-based pad applicator reusable on a new tube, can now go with new textured tips. In the makeup category, Aptar partnered with Quadpack to develop Iconic Woodacity, a refillable lipstick in a wooden case. And for beauty hygiene big sizes, the Pin Pack recyclable eco-refill by the Pinard Beauty Pack manufacturer was completed with new capacities of 250 ml and 1 litre, in addition to 500 ml. All sizes are available in PET and RPET. Mono-material plastic containers are usually preferred for recycling, alongside recycled and recyclable materials, the most widely represented this year. Texen launched the Sweet Collection range composed of a lipstick, a slimstick, and a face stick. All three are exclusively made of PP and ready for recycling. Albéa also broadened its range of mono-material packs for the skincare market with a 100% PP refillable compact free of metal. Thanks to a weight reduced by 35%, compared to a plastic compact of approximately the same size, and to its refillable function, its environmental impact is reduced by 53% after only two refills. One year after the first Future mono-material pump was launched, Aptar broadened this concept to ON/OFF capsules with Future Disc Top, also 100% based on polyethylene, fully recyclable, and designed for e-commerce. As for alternative materials, the paper-based tube solution created by Albéa now comes in a bottle available either in kraft or white shades. With at least 50% of FSC-certified paper (without the cap or the pump, if any), the structure helps reduce the quantity of plastic in the packaging, reducing the carbon footprint. Lastly, to create a soft paper effect on a plastic or glass container, Sleever developed the Matt Velvet ecodesigned decoration solution. This label does not disrupt the recycling process and uses at least 30% of PCR. Noble, recyclable, compatible with all formulas… Thanks to new solutions, glass is gaining ground on many product categories. Aptar has associated it for the first time with its airless technology in Airless Glass, a fully recyclable pack to be launched in 2023. The use of drawn glass helps reduce both the weight and carbon emissions. In the makeup category, the Premi manufacturer showcased a Makeup in Glass collection for different applications: gloss, mascaras, eyeliners... The range comprises 5-ml and 10-ml bottles with a screw neck which can be combined with multiple accessories. Heinz Glas partnered with Geka to unveil Clove, a line of glass bottles for mascara with several finishing, brush, and closing options. Following a similar logic, Pochet put forward the small glass bottle created for the sculptural mascara Le 8 Hypnose by Lancôme, and Bormioli Luigi, their refillable solutions for makeup. Ultimately, as they were celebrating their 400th anniversary, Heinz Glas boldly used controlled flaws in the collection Not a Mistake. With these bottles and jars, they overplayed deviations (irregular bottom, visible stitching, air bubbles…) and turned them into an aesthetic design in line with the current trend of renewed authenticity. Working on sensoriality, technicity, and customization does not mean making compromises on the search for premium solutions. Looking for customizing applications, specialist Cosmogen used the metal 3D printing technology previously unseen in the cosmetics industry to offer various texturization options for the Fresh tube tips designed for lip and eye contour care. With a view to co-develop products with brands, Texen Beauty Partners worked in collaboration with renowned formulators. They created four patented innovations to achieve the perfect combination between the pack, the applicator, and the formula for exclusive lash makeup: – Twice Eyes offers a brush which, as it rotates on the rod, forms multiple angles to reach all lashes. This parameter helps adjust the makeup gesture and work on all lashes, including smaller ones in the eye corner. – Lash Up Roller promises to tame lashes, define them, put makeup on them, and even nourish them, thanks to an adapted formula. The accessory is composed of two rolls that seize the line of lashes to gently curl it. – Multi Intensity Brush is a brush fitted with a rotary system to modulate the length and mass of hairs for tailor-made makeup. An all-in-one solution to create a total makeup look with only one brush. – Multi-Use Pen is an applicator whose handle can house a removable cartridge (makeup, skincare, perfume). Its airless system prevents any risk of infiltration in the mechanism to ensure perfect hygiene. As for perfumes, the new Aqua Silk pump by Aptar was designed for a fine, homogeneous diffusion of alcohol-free perfumes. It diffuses fragrances as gradually as possible in a wrapping gesture."
Baralan launches sustainability-minded versions of standard packaging,"Historically, Baralan's business has focused on glass packaging. Glass is a material generally considered sustainable due to its infinite recyclability, however, bottles, jars and other glass containers are most often accompanied by plastic accessories, in particular lids and caps. The Italian supplier has therefore committed to find acceptable eco-friendly alternatives to traditional plastic components. For these new sustainable solutions, Baralan is highlighting the importance of waste optimization by promoting upcycling through use of organic scraps, such as coffee peel and rice. These upcycled organic scrap materials are mixed with virgin plastic, reducing the overall plastic resin content to create a more sustainable solution suitable for manufacturing a wide range of closures completing Baralan's standard collection. For an even greater sustainability, it is obviously possible to use post-consumer recycled plastic (PCR) in percentages varying from 30% to 100%. The varying PCR levels allow brands to balance their desired level of packaging aesthetics with their sustainability goals while meeting increased consumer demand for sustainable products. Additionally, bio-based materials - produced with a biopolymer derived from renewable resources and natural materials not linked to the food chain - can be utilized to ensure full recyclability of the accessories. Another feature of this new collection is the ability to produce black items without using carbon black, which is notoriously challenging to recycle, because the new masterbatch will not be obtained through combustion. Products made from these green materials significantly expand Baralan's range of sustainable standard solutions. The company therefore ensured that these new products not only comply with mandatory regulations and quality standards, but also protect the formula and ensure the practical functionality of the product in the same way as a traditional accessory. ""This launch is an exciting one for Baralan and has served as an opportunity for us to examine, as a company, how and where we can expand our eco-friendly offerings to benefit the environment further,"" said Maurizio Ficcadenti, Global R&D Manager. ""Our vision is to continuously develop new collections of sustainable products that offer both elegance and superior functionality."""
Cosmogen innovates with tubes equipped with 3D printed applicators,"Still almost unknown in the world of cosmetics, 3D metal printing can help brands differentiate themselves and offer a better user experience. According to Cosmogen, 3D metal printing technology is also of interest in terms of production, since it makes it possible to develop a unique and personalized applicator quickly, as no mould is required, while offering an original and unique dimension to the sensory experience, according to its design. At the Luxe Pack show, held from October 3 to 5 in Monaco, the French company presented different models of made-in-France 3D-printed metal applicators mounted on the patented Fresh tubes [1], intended for lip care and eye contour care. The cold applicator, immersed in its tube, makes it possible to extract a moderate dose of the formula thanks to its reliefs. According to Cosmogen, this innovation, still at the concept stage, has already met with great success with brands and should quickly move into the industrialization step in France, maybe with a glass stem and tube. Beyond 3D printing, Cosmogen also presented five new applicators of their Tense tube. The sensations vary according to the patterns. Cosmogen is also able to develop new, exclusive designs upon brands' request. ""The Tense tube is already very popular with brands. The perceived benefit is immediate, thanks to the cold effect of its applicator and its easy and expert gesture. The design of this patented packaging had been completely redesigned so that the applicator could be removed and reused on a new tube, available in recycled plastic. All components, cap, applicator, tube are recyclable at the end of their life,"" said Cosmogen in a statement. Eventually, Cosmogen has showcased a patented concept consisting of a tube and a screwed metal pad applicator, which can therefore be reused on a new tube. The novelty lies in the texturization of the tip."
Glass: Despite a difficult context Bormioli Luigi is investing for the future,"A key player in the beauty market and a leader in the art of glassmaking in Europe, Bormioli Luigi - which will merge next year with Bormioli Rocco, its tableware subsidiary acquired in 2020, to become the Bormioli Group - is looking to the future, even though the economic climate is difficult to predict. Like its competitors, Bormioli Luigi has to deal with soaring energy costs and, more generally, rising prices for raw materials, transport and packaging. However, while demand fell sharply in 2020, during the health crisis, it is now particularly dynamic, driven by North America and Asia. Despite these mixed signals, the Italian glassmaker is standing firm and preparing for the future, be it in terms of technology and innovation, infrastructure or production capacity. Investments in Spain to meet the needs of the masstige segment, continued product innovation to provide eco-responsible solutions, and a 50% decarbonisation objective by 2030: in total, a EUR 200 million plan is being implemented over the 2019-2023 period. ""Obviously, it s a complicated context, but a glass company that does not innovate and invest is gradually doing away with itself,"" explained Simone Baratta, Director of the Prestige Perfumes Business Unit. ""The company now can meet the needs of its original customers, i.e. premium perfumery, but also to extend its offer to the masstige and cosmetics segment, thanks to our new industrial tool: our glass factory in Azuquaca, located 40 km from Madrid"", commented Marco Azzali, Sales Director Prestige Perfumes. The factory currently manufactures mainly tableware (under the name Bormioli Rocco) and is gradually (and partially) being transformed to produce bottles for mid-range perfumery and cosmetics. One IS machine was installed in 2021 and two more are planned for 2023. In 2024, decoration and finishing operations will also be integrated into the Azuquaca plant ""to build up internal production capacity, thus enabling us to be more flexible and respond more quickly to customer requests,"" specified Simone Baratta. Glass, a material that is infinitely and 100% recyclable, has undeniable advantages at a time when brands and consumers alike are looking for solutions that are both more premium and more responsible. To meet these expectations, Bormioli Luigi's teams have developed numerous innovations to enable the extensive and responsible use of glass: lightweight solutions, recycled glass, interchangeable rings, etc. The Ecoline range thus includes a series of bottles, jars and caps made of ultra-light glass (58% less glass weight than a traditional container). A relevant response in terms of eco-responsibility on which the company continues to invest with a formula that could soon be even more efficient. Watch this space! More recently, Bormioli Luigi has developed a line of glass containers for make-up: refillable lipstick, lipgloss and mascara. To this offer, Bormioli Luigi has added its expertise in the customisation of glass shapes and finishing techniques, including the application of specific decorations or UV protection. The latter has been developed to match the new generation of perfumes and care products whose natural formulas are light-sensitive. As for the interchangeable rings, they have been designed by the glassmaker primarily to serve the market for refillable perfumery and skincare products. Finally, Bormioli Luigi has been offering for several years now PCR (Post-Consumer Recycled) glass, the demand for which is constantly increasing: ""All the premium brands want a percentage - as high as possible - of PCR glass in their bottles, with no compromise on quality of course,"" explained Simone Baratta. ""This is a very challenging market where the offer for quality PCR is extremely variable today, which forces us to contract with the quality providers we selected to ensure the sustainability of our offer,"" concluded Simone Baratta."
"ACT Beauty France, a merger of companies for a global service offering","Premium Beauty News - What is the company's positioning, now that you have merged and changed names? Cyril Dauvers - I always knew that ACT Import was a gem, and that it had a real potential for development, in particular thanks to its strong presence in the beauty industry, which I did not reach with MPP My Planet Packaging. By merging the two companies, we developed a comprehensive service approach – retail accessories, luxury packaging, luggage, and fashion accessories – with a more glamorous name: ACT Beauty France. The packaging expertise of MPP My Planet Packaging helped ACT Beauty France win markets in cosmetic accessories, thanks to 100% recycled materials. Since packaging is complementary to and present throughout the value chain of the products sold by ACT Beauty France, it was only logical and rational to merge the two companies. Premium Beauty News - Your design division went from two employees to seven in less than two years. What are your expectations? Cyril Dauvers - Indeed! In one year and a half, we recruited fifteen people, including five in the design division. We also opened an office in NYC, with one employee on site to strengthen our local presence. We had a lot of success at the Luxe Pack New York, MakeUp in Los Angeles, and Cosmoprof Las Vegas shows. As for the design division, since we completed our team, which is composed of designers, stylists, and artistic directors, we have been able to meet highly complex demands in packaging, accessories, or luggage. Now, we can offer our clients turnkey solutions, from creation to delivery. Premium Beauty News - You recently created an eco-responsible range of makeup accessories called Éco Essentielle. The brush handles are made of recycled computer keyboards. What message do you aim to send with this creation? Cyril Dauvers - Actually, it goes much beyond sending a message. It shows our clients that we are committed. Indeed, we always try and integrate eco-responsible initiatives to our propositions. We choose cleaner, more responsible recycled materials, whenever possible. For these 100% recycled brushes with vegan hairs, we partnered with professional makeup artists who did a great job in terms of gesture analysis. We have just unveiled a gorgeous collection: I hope it gets the success it deserves!"
Luxe Pack Monaco will put glass under the spotlight for its 34th edition,"""Luxe Pack Monaco is more than a trade fair. It is a meeting point, an atmosphere, and a really exciting environment,"" emphasizes Fabienne Germond, Show Director. ""The undisputed advantage of Luxe Pack Monaco is that it showcases the international leaders in luxury packaging alongside small companies offering very specific expertise."" For its 34th edition, from October 3 to 5, the flagship event for prestige and luxury packaging intends to highlight the current transformations of the sector, the scale of which is probably unprecedented. ""New consumer behaviours are emerging as a result, which will become the norm with the arrival of Generation Alpha: e-commerce, selling directly to the consumer, personalisation, and an even greater taste for the exceptional and unique are all new trends that brands are making their own,"" adds Germond. Added to these transformations in demand are gigantic environmental and economic pressures, as well as supply chain and procurement issues, that force manufacturers to quickly reinvent their production methods. To address these topics, the conference program, which will bring together more than 50 speakers and will be structured upon five main pillars: GOING BIG (trends and forecasts), GOING GREEN (towards circularity), GOING TO CUSTOMERS (packaging for new markets, new customers and consumer behaviours), GOING LOCAL (transition to virtuous sourcing models), GOING DISRUPTIVE (materials and technology). On the occasion of the International Year of Glass, Luxe Pack Monaco wants to promote this material, to highlight the diversity of the know-how linked to its production and decoration, and to provide an overview of what glass can offer to luxury brand packaging. ""Welcome to the AGE OF GLASS !"", an operation supported by FEVE, the European Container Glass Federation will curate a showcase featuring the most striking recent productions created by glassmakers and designers. On this occasion, visitors will have direct access to concept and production experts who will collectively answer their questions on the challenges regarding this very extraordinary material. Throughout the event a perfume will be offered to all visitors. Stemming from the glassmakers' expertise, and created by fragrance house Firmenich and international brand curation agency Centdegrés the perfume is inspired by the ""scent of glass."" On the show floor, a dedicated pathway, named ""THE GLASS ROAD"" will allow to identify at a glance the exhibiting glass specialists coming from all over the world: B.I. Industrial, Baralan, Berlin Packaging, Bormioli Luigi, Cloud Beauty Innovation Hub, Coverpla, Edwanex Glass, Embelia, Estal, Eurovetrocap, Flacopharm, Gerresheimer, Pochet, Heinz Glas, Hrastnik1860, Italesse Premium Bottles, Kefla Glas, Nest-Filler Pkg, Nouglass, O-I Glass, Oskar Karla, PGP Glass Private, Saint Louis, Saverglass, SGD Pharma Beauty & Care, Sopac, Stoelzle Glass, Verrerie du Futur, Vetronaviglio, Vinolok, Virospack, Vitro, Vta-Sover, Waltersperger, Wheaton, Zignago Vetro. In addition, a dedicated conference on the theme ""Glass Toward The Future"" will gather a panel of experts [1] to provide an enlightened overeview at this material as well as the innovations and solutions put in place to reduce its ecological footprint and solve complex issues of cost, energy reduction and transport. ""In short, visitors to this year's fair will once again have a lot to do between discovering the expertise of exhibitors, the programme of high-level talks and creative events tailor-made for the show,"" concludes Fabienne Germond."
Plastic injection: Faiveley Plast reorganizes and becomes FaiveleyTech,"For three decades, the policy of acquiring sites, tools and skills have stepped up, making Faiveley Plast an entity with a vast level of expertise and specialist sectors in three main areas of expertise - namely industry, business and healthcare. ""We wanted to mark this upskilling, ensuring that we fully express through this name-change our added value in terms of engineering and innovation in the digital and eco-responsibility domains. Our new name, FaiveleyTech perfectly summarises all of our brand names, pools together our full range of skills and gives us increased visibility to clients and partners,"" explains Nicolas Alloin, CEO of FaiveleyTech. The new name was selected by the group's teams, the Board of Directors and the historical family shareholder. The addition of ""Tech"" highlights the increasing ""technological"" content of the company's products, and is also a hat-tip to ""French Tech"". FaiveleyTech intends participate in the reindustrialisation of the French territory through the expansion of its expertise, in particular going further than simply transformation of raw materials, and moving towards the development of complex products. In addition to the new name, the baseline ""Manufacture d'avenir durable"" attempts to mark continuity between the past and future with the company's deep roots in tradition and its aim to create a responsible future. By adopting the FaiveleyTech brand name, the Group has made the choice to no longer use the old names for its sites and entities as integrated down the years. Sites will be named after the town or city where they are located: FaiveleyTech Orgelet (formerly VPI), FaiveleyTech Annecy (formerly Eudica), FaiveleyTech Bourgoin (formerly Sepal), etc. Thus brought together under a single brand name, the group's various activities are organized into three Business Units covering the group's areas of expertise - namely Industry, Beauty and Health - and cross-functional services such as human resources, finance and purchasing. ""Our aim is for each Business Unit to draw on the best practices of each individual, to pool together and further improve capabilities across all aspects, for collective development and emulation beneficial to us all,"" explains Nicolas Alloin. ""Each area of excellence exists to assist the others. The fact that we operate in three separate domains represents genuine added value, as issues and requirements are transversal. The bridges between these three sectors each represent opportunities to develop and innovate, as required by our clients,"" he adds. According to FaiveleyTech, the reorganisation into Business Units will bring greater transparency and competitivity to both partners and client entities. Each factory has its own expertise, and the clients' projects will benefit from this pooling together. Clients will have a sole point of contact within FaiveleyTech who will offer them the opportunity of manufacturing in one or more sites with specific expertise for their projects. FaiveleyTech Orgelet (formerly VPI) produces the connected spray cap for Paco Rabanne's new women's fragrance Fame After having created an ultra-fine connected spray cap for the men's fragrance Phantom, FaiveleyTech Orgelet (formerly Faiveley Plast Beauty, VPI) has now also designed its women's version. The challenge was identical, namely creating a spray cap integrating an NFC chip, for refills, and an unrivalled aesthetic appeal FaiveleyTech created and developed the spray cap for the 80 ml Fame fragrance bottle. This design also included the integration of an NFC chip within the spray cap, which is also the robot's head, combined with project management of the entire assembly. For the overall aesthetics, the choice fell on a wonderfully sleek galvanised gold. Finally, the spray cap was designed to make product refills much easier, thanks to a sensory screwing system which guarantees preservation of the fragrance. This offers a sustainable dimension to the product."
"Skincare brands opt for Star Drop, Aptar's packaging for ultra-fluid formulas","Developed for ultra-fluid formulas, Star Drop features a soft and easily ""squeezable"" bottle to dispense just the right amount of product. Its dispensing system features a patented valve technology, which automatically cuts off the product flow as soon as the pressure on the barrel drops, with an instant retraction effect sucking the formula back inside the pack. This technology ensures clean and controlled dispensing, with no leak hazard. The packaging pipette applicator - also patented - is transparent to see the product rise inside the tip and to control and deliver more easily the desired amount of formula, drop by drop. Star Drop was recently chosen by two brands that actively support sustainable beauty, Laboratoires de Biarritz for Face & Body Self-Tanning Drops and Ouate Paris for My 1,2,3 Sunshine Sunscreen. These are the first 100% skincare launches for Star Drop, emphasizes Aptar Beauty + Home. According to the expert of consumer product dispensing solutions, the two French brands have been convinced by the ergonomic design of the packaging, which makes it easy to use, and by its ready to use compact format. Furthermore, it is perfectly suited for fluid and ultra-fluid formulas and is compliant with ECOCERT/COSMOS specifications regarding organic formulas. ""Star Drop provides a satisfying almost magical sensation of control as exact dosages are dispensed. The gesture is super simple for consumers but the level of precision is unparalleled,"" said Patrick Bousquel, Marketing Director Beauty EMEA Aptar Beauty + Home. Robust enough for e- commerce (ISTA-6 certified), Star Drop is also compatible with PP recycling streams to ensure the recyclability of the full pack. Eventually, in order to further decrease the environmental footprint of the packaging, it is now possible to integrate recycled content in the packaging. Eventually, Aptar Beauty + Home has adapted its offer to address the expectations of the most agile brands. The supplier now offers Star Drop in smaller quantities (MOQ 5k pieces) and makes it available in only two weeks for standard packs."
Schwan and Sulapac create a sawdust-based packaging for cosmetic pencils,"The pandemic brought up climate change and environment to historical levels among the Gen Z and millennial list of concerns. According to the ""Deloitte Millennial Survey 2020"", protecting the Earth clearly appears as the top priority for these generations, which were surveyed in 13 countries around the world [1]. And most of them said they intend to continue changing their daily, personal routines with an eye toward improving the planet. For instance, two-thirds (64%) said they are cutting back on single-use plastic and recycling more. It is in this context that Schwan Cosmetics and Sulapac have combined their skills to create lip liner and eyeliner pencils with a sustainable barrel material, capable of containing the volatile ingredients that are key components of these products. So far, the main challenge of using bio-based materials in cosmetic pencils is that most natural materials are not capable of maintaining the suitable freshness of the makeup inside the pencil. This is the reason why most makeup pencils today are encased in virgin plastic. While various sustainable materials have been implemented in beauty packaging in recent years, this is the first time that Sulapac's plastic alternative material is being used in color cosmetic pencils. The airtight pencil barrel that holds the sensitive ingredients is made from Sulapac Flow v1.8 biomaterial, derived from sawdust from industrial side streams and plant-based binders. The design principle of Sulapac is to mimic nature. Similar to a piece of wood on the forest floor, the Finish company's materials can be digested by naturally occurring microorganisms and they break down into carbon dioxide, water, and biomass, leaving no traces behind. ""This is a breakthrough for us because we were able to invent a better material to encase our pencils. This replaces virgin plastic with a material that leaves no permanent microplastics on the planet! And, we don't have to make any compromises on the quality or performance of our long-lasting, high-pigment shades. This line is suited to come in an endless variety of textures and colors, and the barrel material has to be top-notch to preserve their integrity. Through our collaboration with Sulapac, we aren't just creating an innovative product for our clients, we're also investing in a more sustainable future for the cosmetics industry,"" says Dr. Alexander Doll, Head of Research and Development at Schwan Cosmetics. TheBetterBarrel product line will be launched officially at the tradeshow MakeUp in New York on September 14 and 15."
Kao switches to chemically recycled PET for the inner plate of new foundations,"In order to reduce the amount of virgin plastics used in the makeup category of its beauty business, the Kao group has committed itself to increase the proportion of recycled resins in all its plastic cosmetic containers. To that end, the group has partnered with PET Refine Technology, a subsidiary of Jeplan that uses the chemical recycling technology developed by the Jeplan group. Kao has started introducing the chemically recycled PET materials progressively from July of this year. Chemical recycling consists in breaking down used PET material to remove impurities. The molecules are then repolymerized in order to be used as a new raw material PET resin. This technology differs from mechanical recycling as it allows to fully regenerate PET with the same physical properties and quality as those of virgin resins directly derived from petroleum. Kao began using chemically recycled PET materials in June 2021 for the containers of its cosmetics brand Twany, and has been gradually expanding their use to a number of brands. In addition to this, Kao is collaborating with Jeplan on a horizontal recycling field test where used cosmetics bottles collected from customers are turned into new plastic cosmetic bottles. Packaging are collected at selected retail outlets and used for field testing of material recycling based on Jeplan's chemical recycling technology. Usually, the compact case containing powder foundations can be easily refilled using inner plates made of virgin PET material or aluminium, depending on the features of the product. For its makeup brands, Kao currently uses inner plates made of virgin PET material. These plates will be gradually switched to chemically recycled PET material of the same quality, thus allowing concerned brands to combine refill and the use of recycled plastics to lower their carbon and environmental footprint. In the future, Kao will also consider other initiatives to achieve horizontal recycling and realize plastic circularity in society through its ESG strategy established in 2019, which has set ""Zero Waste"" as one of its key targets. Kao's cosmetics division includes over 20 brands such as Attack, Bioré, Goldwell, Jergens, John Frieda, Kanebo, Laurier, Merries, and Molton Brown. Combined with its chemical division, which contributes to a wide range of industries, Kao generates about 1,420 billion yen in annual sales. Kao employs about 33,500 people worldwide."
Pochet bets on digital and decoration for ultra-creative packaging,"In partnership with companies specializing in digital solutions, the French manufacturer of luxury packaging solutions has developed new decoration and personalization techniques that combine creativity and agility. Relief is a realistic finish achieved through digital printing that gives the illusion and the sensation of a transparent or coloured engraving in the glass. This innovation allows the decoration of a bottle in line with today's demands for speed, agility and reduced development times. The relief decoration is the result of a partnership with Carbon Decor, a French company specializing in the finishing - including digital printing - of perfume bottles and glass jars intended for cosmetics, wines and spirits. Relief offers an accentuated volume of the decoration while guaranteeing its precision. It can be applied partially or 360° over the entire bottle. With the Unlimited technology, Pochet offers a collection of caps, hoods and accessories for cosmetics and perfumes using additive manufacturing. The main advantage of the technology is that all shapes are possible, with no limit to creativity. It makes possible to create designs that cannot traditionally be made using conventional injection moulding. But technology also allows for simplified, agile and rapid developments. A wide range of finishes (satin, matte or coloured) is also possible. This technique is the result of a partnership with Polyrepro, a French company specializing in 3D printing. Thanks to a vast choice of accessories, the Imagin'it concept makes it easy to accessorise perfume caps. The patented concept makes it very easy to assemble and disassemble all the components, using a tool developed and designed by the Groupe Pochet teams. Ideal for accessorizing at the point of sale, the concept also facilitates the separation of the various components which can thus placed the appropriate recycling streams. Different types of materials can be used: additive manufacturing (3D printing), aluminium, r-PET, etc. Finally, Light Nuance is a decoration technology of glass bottles and jars based on heat-polishing. It allows to create iridescent, holographic and shimmering, light effects with nuanced and changing colours of variable intensity. The technique, well mastered by Pochet du Courval, is applied in the continuity of the bottle's manufacturing process before any decoration. Light Nuance offers environmental advantages including the absence of CMR (Carcinogenic, Mutagenic and Reprotoxic) and nanoparticles. The technology makes it possible to create a resistant and durable decor, suitable for rechargeable products. The final bottle remains recyclable in glass sorting streams."
"Mondi, Dow and Essity launch secondary packaging made from biomass","Mondi, a global leader in packaging and paper, has collaborated with Essity and Dow to create new, recyclable secondary packaging for Essity's feminine care products. Their goal was to decrease the use of virgin plastic of fossil origin by using renewable or post-consumer recycled materials. Essity's feminine care towels were previously packed in bags that already used 50% renewable materials. However, additional research and testing by Mondi, resulted in the recommendation of a new solution that aligns with Essity's packaging goals: to work towards 100% recyclability and to use up to 85% biomass, renewable or recycled material in all bags. The new packaging contributes to these sustainability goals by using a renewable material and by-product from the paper making industry that is produced from circular feedstock based on the ISCC (International Sustainability & Carbon Certification) mass balance approach. The new packaging also contains a mechanically recycled plastic resin from post-consumer material. To that end, Mondi worked with Dow and other companies along the value chain to find the most suitable resin formulation for this solution. The end result is an extruded film that is printed on and converted into a bag. The new packaging provides the same high-level of protection as the previous solution, preventing the feminine care range from moisture and light that could damage it. According to Mondi, the new solution has strong sealing properties and delivers outstanding print quality to maintain on-shelf appeal for Essity's European brands, such as Bodyform, Libresse, Nana and Nuvenia. ""The challenge was to find the best combination of renewable and recycled content that maintains product quality and the production efficiency already enjoyed by Essity. We tested several options until we found the most suitable solution. Working in collaboration with Essity and Dow validates our EcoSolutions approach; we go back to the start and ask the right questions to ensure we create the best possible solution for our customers,"" said Marjo Kuisma, Regional Sales Consumer Flexibles, Mondi. For Guosheng Zhang, Global Technical Innovation Manager Feminine Care at Essity, the new packaging solution - with its reduced carbon footprint - demonstrates the group's commitment to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation: to work towards full recyclability and to increase the use of recycled plastic in our packaging. ""The end result is eye-catching, well designed and makes a positive impact on the environment,"" he concluded."

"Sampling, a major multi-channel asset for winning back beauty customers","In a (post) Covid context that has completely changed consumer practices and buying patterns, Holy Sampling, via the Harris Interactive research institute, has sought to question a broad panel of women who use perfumes, skincare products and make-up. More than 1,600 women were questioned, divided into two groups: one representative of French women aged 18 to 59 and the other composed of women — known as digital sampling — who had already been subjected to an e-sampling campaign run by Holy Sampling. The challenge here is to understand what users expect from brands in the sector, in a context where the number of visits to POS has not returned to its pre-Covid level, with a very noticeable impact on selective distribution and single-brand shops — a drop that is not fully offset by digital channels and e-commerce. Women interviewed said they find it difficult to buy new products on the Internet without being able to test them first. However, they are not reluctant to buy online products that they already know/use. Finally, the regulatory framework has also strongly motivated this study, since from 1 July 2022 it will be forbidden to issue a sample without the consumer's explicit request. Another finding of the study is that consumers feel more willing and comfortable asking for samples online than in POS. 92% of French women say that samples are useful to their shopping experience, of which 45% consider them indispensable - this figure climbs to 75% with digital sampling. This need to test the product before purchasing it is consistent with the other findings of the study. 55 % of French women say they trust themselves in terms of advice and recommendations, followed by sales advisers and friends and relatives. For digital sampling, 72% trust themselves first, then brands (55%) and finally the opinions of online users (44%). Samples are preferred as the primary means of discovery (60% for French women, 80% for digital sampling), far ahead of other traditional contact means such as reviews (46%) and advertising (40%). The sample appears to be the most influential touchpoint across the entire consumer journey, which is divided into four stages: discovery, appreciation, purchase and recommendation. ""The digital experience is the big concern of brands today! But as we have seen, for categories such as skin care, make-up and perfume, the purchase decision is largely based on testing. This is where e-sampling comes in. It will allow introducing samples in homes, precisely where the consumer uses her products,"" explains Bruno Pinheiro, co-founder of Holy Sampling. By using e-sampling instead of mass sampling at its distributors, for example, the brand will be able to gradually establish a close relationship with its customers and, through the collection of data, personalise its approach - both in terms of the sample sent and in the brand's future statements (for CRM opt-ins). Indeed, the study shows that French women have high expectations in terms of personalisation, consideration and relationship with brands. Data is still not used enough and often remains transactional rather than experiential. Annie Begnaud, Innovation Strategy Consultant and Sampling Specialist, agrees with the overly timid CRM use of sampling and adds ""customer experience is fundamental to the performance of a digital sampling campaign: unboxing and customer follow-up after receipt are decisive and as important as a proper targeting."" For Holy Sampling, a sample must be received and used in optimal conditions, and this also implies the right amount of product, allowing it to be used over several days so that it becomes part of the future customer's beauty routine. ""This is when it is most effective and strongly encourages the purchasing act,"" stresses Olivia Delagarde, the co-founder. ""Holy Sampling's mission is to restore the value of samples by creating original and customisable sampling paths. We encourage qualitative and personalised packaging to strengthen the bond between the brand and its consumers but also encourage them to share their experiences as these packages make the sample instagrammable and convey the brand's image,"" adds Olivia Delagarde. A strategy that is proving its worth since, according to the company, the conversion rate is +10 points for traditional e-sampling against +20 points for Holy Sampling."
Packaging: PRP Creation files for a safeguard procedure,"The company's management explains that it is facing a particularly difficult economic environment since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has seriously hampered its development plan. According to its managers, the company based in Oyonnax, France, in the Ain region, had planned to renew its fleet of machines, whose obsolescence had become noticeable with the strong growth recorded in 2017, following the takeover by the STLinks Group. In November 2020, PRP Creation announced that it had completed the renewal of its pool of injection moulding machines with the introduction of ten new electric and automated presses. In total, four 90-tonne presses, four 150-tonne presses, one 190-tonne press and one 360-tonne press had joined PRP Creation's injection moulding facility to meet all its customers' requirements. 3 million euros were invested in 2020 to increase the company's production capabilities. New extrusion blow moulding machines were to complete the fleet. Unfortunately, the sudden health crisis seems to have upset the proper timing of this development plan. The sharp drop in activity in 2020 slowed down investments. These issues were followed by supply problems and then a ""surge in all cost items"" (plastic materials, cardboard, wood, power supplies, etc.). A context that severely disrupted the company's business plan, with a strong impact on its cash flow. However, the government's support measures have enabled PRP Creation to ""maintain its position in the cosmetics market and accelerate its developments in the context of circular economy (100% recyclable solutions: XTrem Capsule and XTrem Pump, the use of recycled and biosourced materials,...),"" explained the company in a release. Since March 2022, the management has been working on the implementation of the new aids proposed by the government (PGE [1] resilience, industry loan, PGE* spread) needed to cope with the consequences of rising production costs. However, ""despite an understanding of PRP Creation's problems, the different operators concerned by these schemes did not consider it appropriate to provide their financial support"", the company regretted. By placing PRP Creation under the protection of the Bourg-en-Bresse Commercial Court, the management intends to preserve its industrial tool and maintain a maximum number of jobs. A restructuring plan, including a spread of debts, should be presented shortly. The management team is confident in the company's ability to meet this new challenge, with ""a motivated team"" and ""highly successful"" innovations, including the XTrem pump presented at the 2021 Luxe Pack Monaco trade show and recently awarded at the Paris Packaging Week. ""I am firmly convinced that with the support of our entire ecosystem and teams, PRP Creation will bounce back quickly and re-enter a growth phase in the luxury and masstige market,"" declared Joël Viry, CEO of the company. PRP Creation offers comprehensive packaging solutions (bottle + dispensing system + decoration) for the cosmetics, perfume, personal care and hygiene markets. Thanks to its expertise in the three moulding technologies (injection, extrusion blow moulding and injection blow moulding) and decoration technologies (screen printing, hot stamping and pad printing), millions of bottles are produced each year in its French factory. For several years, the company has been investing in various eco-design solutions in line with market expectations (reduction of the CO2 impact and 100% recyclable products). At the beginning of the year, PRP Creation announced the sale of its flexible packaging division to Texen."
Trade shows: Full house for Paris Packaging Week 2022,"The event, organised by Easyfairs, brought together professionals from the aerosol and dispensing (ADF), beauty and fragrance (PCD), premium drinks (PLD) and other luxury sectors. Some 6,912 visitors, and a total of 10,509 attendees including stand personnel from the 637 exhibitors, passed through the doors of the 2022 edition of Paris Packaging Week. This year's figures are quite similar to figures equivalent to those of the pre-pandemic edition in January 2020, which welcomed 650 exhibitors and more than 10,000 visitors. ""We are very pleased with the visitor and exhibitor figures. The health situation suggested that there may be a drop in the number of participants, but this was not the case. Paris Packaging Week is back to the excellent figures of its 2020 edition, with an additional human dimension: the pleasure of finally meeting and being together. This is what struck me as I toured the show. The atmosphere was one of smiles, of positive energy, of the joy of being face to face again. It was the reunion our industry needed,"" said Josh Brooks, event director of Paris Packaging Week. The 637 exhibitors, including more than a hundred first-time exhibitors, occupied 25,000 square metres of exhibition space, including Talks stages, Awards galleries and the many networking areas across the show floor. Innovation Awards, student challenges, and conferences were also key highlights of this edition. After the winners were unveiled last April, the ADF, PCD and PLD Innovation Awards ceremonies were held in the presence of all participants. These three ceremonies plus a new gallery highlighted five key market trends: – Monomaterial packaging; – Reduction of material use; – Refills; – Personalisation; – Consumer experience. Each ceremony was marked by a keynote speech by a leading figure in his or her sector: the PCD Innovation Awards by Franck Marilly, President and CEO of Shiseido EMEA; the ADF Innovation Awards by Alain d'Haese, General Secretary of the FEA (European Aerosol Federation); and the PLD Innovation Awards by Sandrine Sommer, Chief Sustainability Officer of Moët Hennessy. This year again, packaging school ESEPAC and the École Supérieure du Parfum (ESP) students worked on a project proposed by a key player in the cosmetics market, The Estée Lauder Companies for this edition. The five winning projects and their creators were thus invited to present the outcome of their reflections on the PCD Talks stage. This year's theme was: ""How to reinvent unique, luxurious and sustainable consumer experiences for the luxury fragrance market."" The projects were also exhibited at the heart of the show. ""We were impressed by the students' work. They were able to show creative audacity and express multiple avenues for packaging that is closer to the combined desires of the brands and their customers. Their professionalism and imagination augur well for our professions,"" said Marc Lechanoine, Global Senior Vice President Creative Design & Packaging Innovation at The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. For the first time in 2022, the packaging school ESIReims proposed to its students and offered them the opportunity to take up the challenge launched by Huda Beauty and Shiseido that consisted in either totally reinventing a palette of 18 shades by making it refillable and recyclable, or transforming the secondary packaging of the Kayali brand's flagship perfume by rethinking it in terms of eco-design and industrialization. ""We are delighted and excited by the students' work. They were very committed to the projects and were able to come up with very concrete answers to the problems we presented them with,"" said Wendy Annonay, Sr. Director, Packaging Design & Development at Huda Beauty. The Shiseido challenge relied on very precise specifications and asked the students to revisit the WASO range dedicated to Generation Z. Emmanuelle Bonardi, Shiseido's Director of Packaging Development, praised the excellent work carried out: ""They came up with real, concrete, well-thought-out and well-designed projects. They were able to propose real solutions with impressive rigour and maturity. The winning works in the various categories were also on display for visitors to see. The dynamism of Paris Packaging Week was also expressed in its Talks and its inspirational areas. The 2022 edition marked the first gallery dedicated to the Innovation Awards, which complemented another inspiring space: the Pentawards gallery, curated by the leading annual international packaging design competition. The Eco-Tours were particularly well attended and appreciated, as was the rich programme of conferences. These addressed crucial themes for the three pillars of the event: the response to new consumer expectations, eco-responsibility, which has become a central issue in all packaging development, the place of technological innovations in the packaging of the future, and the new problems arising from the pandemic. The next edition of Paris Packaging Week will be held on 25 and 26 January 2023, still at Porte de Versailles. Two major innovations have already been announced: the launch of a Paris edition of Packaging Première under the Paris Packaging Week umbrella, alongside ADF, PCD and PLD; and a major new partnership with the European Aerosol Federation (FEA), in order to merge their biennial Global Aerosol Events, with ADF. ""Beauty and high-end beverages represent about 75% of the luxury packaging market. The remaining 25% concerns fine food, confectionery, watches and jewellery, leather goods, fashion, accessories and luxury retail. All these areas are covered by the Packaging Première show and launching Packaging Première at Paris Packaging Week 2023 allows us to create a complete event targeted at the luxury industries,"" said Josh Brooks."
Stoelzle and Technicaps launch a refillable and 100% recyclable cosmetic jar,"The development teams from Stoelzle and Technicaps got together at the beginning of the project and it took them only one year to develop a new refillable cosmetic jar. Called ""Le Perpétuel"", it is described as ""an innovative standard offering a simple and intuitive assembly system with easy handling and refillability"". It consists of a glass jar, a PP cup and a PET cap. Once separated, each element is recyclable. All three elements can be decorated. The two teams paid great attention to making the refill operation as intuitive and simple as possible; an objective that required a sophisticated design, facilitated by the pooling of their expertise. Based on the glassmaker's Classic jar, Le Perpétuel differs from other jars in that the length of the standard ring was enhanced to accommodate the refillable cup (50ml). The neck has three indexation zones, when refillable jars on the market have only two. These three indexing points — located at the opening area to position the cup's notches, at the locking area to prevent its withdrawal by translation, and at the stopping area to ensure its locking — actually facilitate the withdrawal and insertion of the cup. ""To remove the empty refill, the user simply grabs the collar, unlocks it, and inserts the new one by locking it,"" explains Angèle Messian, Key Account Manager at Stoelzle. ""The amplitude of the gesture was calculated to avoid straining the wrist when refilling,"" she adds. Produced in France in the Stoelzle Masnières Perfume glass factory, the jar contains 15% PCR-cullet, with no alteration in the colour of the glass. In a commitment to lightening and reducing CO2 emissions, the weight of the jar was reduced to 129 g. compared to 189 g for the Classic jar, which does not disrupt the high-speed production of the jar, the glass maker assures. The French site of the Austrian group has a hybrid furnace (gas/electricity) whose electrical supply is 100% renewable, coming from a small hydroelectric plant. ""A type of power plant that respects biodiversity,"" says Etienne Gruyez, the company's CEO. Easy to handle, Technicaps' cup guarantees water-tightness and heat-sealability. Made entirely of PP, it can be recycled as soon as the recycling chain is operational. The company says that the PET cap was chosen for two reasons: it is recyclable and allows for the creation of a rigid cap with thick walls, giving it the robustness necessary for the equivalent of four product shelf-lives. Finally, the black tinted PET (obtained by dyeing, which does not hinder its recycling, unlike carbon black) or white PET, gives the whole package a luxurious appeal. Technicaps, which specialises in the design of premium capping and packaging solutions, created an office a year ago dedicated to the R&D of new cellulose-based materials to assess their properties, particularly their physico-chemical and toxicological characteristics. ""With the ecological transition, regulations are changing at a rapid pace. We owe it to our customers to act responsively and responsibly to offer them new materials that have been tested and validated before being put on the market,"" says Nicolas Carron, Managing Director of Technicaps. As early as the second refill, the consumer has offset the C02 emissions emitted for the production of the jar and its cup, say Stoelzle and Technicaps, who jointly propose ""this new offer of refillable and intuitive cosmetic packaging."""
Cosmogen wants to improve the application experience of solid cosmetics,"Considering there is a lack of a packaging solutions to meet the specificities of solid cosmetics, Cosmogen is continuing to develop its patented mono-material stick technology presented in September 2021 at the Luxe Pack Monaco trade show. The ReUse stick is refillable (56% plastic saved with each refill), mono-material (PP) and watertight to facilitate the preservation of products containing water or solvents. To protect the brand's image, the refill cannot be used without being lodged in the outer casing. In addition, the ReUse stick is fully customizable. In partnership with Anjac Health & Beauty, Cosmogen has validated the compatibility of the stick with different formulas (foundation, suncare, moisturizer). Full service solutions (pack + formulas) are therefore available. In addition, Cosmogen has developed removable and washable applicators that can be placed on the top of the ReUse stick. Two types of applicators have been developed for different types of products: a brush for skincare and make-up products, a metallic cold-effect tip for a massage-type application. Today, says Cosmogen, ""the ReUse stick is much more than a prototype, production moulds have been manufactured and industrialization is imminent."" Also with the aim to improve the experience of applying solid cosmetics, Cosmogen has developed a range of small brushes with wide handles. These new kabuki brushes allow a simple, hygienic and sensory application of solid cosmetics: one just has to wet the tuft and rub it on the product before application. ""The way many solid products available on the market are applied on the skin raises hygiene questions or generate a poor sensorial experience"", explains Maud Lelièvre, Marketing & Communication Director at Cosmogen."
Paris Packaging Week to open an edition focusing on the challenges of packaging,"Rescheduling the event to June 29 and 30 allowed the event to take on its new identity six months ahead of schedule. The ADF, PCD and PLD shows are now held under a single umbrella brand: Paris Packaging Week.

"Beiersdorf, Clariant, Siegwerk and Borealis create a 100% circular bottle","Clariant, Siegwerk, Borealis, and Beiersdorf have combined their expertise to create recyclable consumer packaging for personal care applications, based on 100% retrieved plastic packaging waste. The collaboration aimed to design a packaging solution that creates a cleaner input waste stream and finds its way back into the loop in high-value applications. It should also allow for the high-quality visuals and distinctive shapes consumers associate with cosmetics packaging and brands. To deliver on all these factors, the innovation centres on a colourless polyolefin bottle with 100% PCR [1] content, full body sleeved in a printed deinkable shrink sleeve. To achieve full circularity, the packaging material needs to retain its optimal properties throughout multiple life cycles. Borealis therefore brought high-quality PCR to the project based on its Borcycle M technology, while Clariant offered expertise in additive solutions to ensure PCR quality and protect against polymer chain breakdown in each recycling step. The result, according to the four companies, was a high-value PCR material repeatedly hit the high-end criteria of personal care packaging. To achieve differentiation of the packaging despite using an uncoloured bottle, the four partners opted for a full body shrink sleeve. The bottle/shrink sleeve combination is intended for removal at a materials recovery facility. However, to increase the circularity of the solution, Siegwerk was able to provide inks designed to allow deinking of the sleeve. Thus, all materials are technically fully recyclable with the potential to be recovered and used for the same application. According to the four companies, first sorting trials in existing recycling infrastructure proved the sortability of the full body sleeved HDPE bottle, achieving a high recovery of the bottle's material. Additionally, the project team conducted trials with full body sleeved, transparent PET bottles and achieved similar results. However, further advancements in sorting technology are needed to truly give colourless bottles a second life back. ""Technologies such as digital watermarking or artificial intelligence could help such sustainability goals to be reached,"" conclude the four partners."
Livcer bounces back with new generation thermoforming machinery,"After the fire that destroyed its production site in late September 2021, the Livcer company soon reacted, going back to business as soon as November. ""We were very reactive. We were able to start our production again less than two months after the fire, with four lines out of nine, thanks to four second-hand machines and stocks. Fortunately, storage was outsourced, so our materials were safe at one of our subcontractors',"" explains Aude de Livonnière, President of Livcer. Seven operational lines in July Thanks to the arrival of new machines, Livcer can now enjoy optimum production capacity. Seven lines will be operational as soon as July to meet all customers' needs in terms of time-to-market and innovation. ""This generation of machines is definitely in line with ecodesign expectations, and more energy-efficient. They can process paper, i.e. recyclable doses, but also all new generations of recycled plastics. They also help reduce 30% of material waste,"" says the Director. These new industrial tools are more efficient in terms of production speed and can print back to back or two sides at the same time for capacities from 0.1 ml to 60 ml. They can also produce flat-bottom single doses which can be laid vertically. ""Our new machines work faster and offer more options,"" sums up Aude de Livonnière. Thanks to these investments, the Livcer company boasts a broad offering adapted to new brand expectations, in particular indie brands', adds Aude de Livonnière. ""With these new machines, we can still produce large series, but we have also chosen smaller, more agile formats with which moulds can be changed faster. We aimed to meet the needs of makeup brands who ask for smaller quantities with a wider palette of colours. Since mould sizes are reduced, they also require less plastic for doses with the same capacity, but smaller blisters,"" she concludes. These innovations will be showcased alongside the single doses made from recyclable paper at the MakeUp in Paris show next June 16-17, 2022."
Aptar and Quadpack join forces to develop refillable wooden lipstick,"Barcelona-headquartered beauty packaging supplier Quadpack has combined its expertise in wooden packaging with Aptar's technology in lipstick mechanisms. The two companies have jointly developed a refillable lipstick which aims to push the boundaries of sustainability and sensory appeal in makeup packaging. Dubbed ""Iconic Woodacity lipstick"", the new packaging solution was designed for minimal impact and maximum consumer engagement. It combines Aptar's Iconic mechanism with Quadpack's Woodacity full-wood patented technology. Aptar's POM-free, glue-free and lubricant-free mechanism offers a smooth, constant and precise rotation, thus allowing smooth actuation of the bullet over time. According to the company, the mechanism is reliable and compatible with most filling lines without any adjustments, and recognised as a quality standard by leading makeup brands worldwide. Attached to an aluminium tube, the mechanism is contained in a monomaterial wooden casing custom-designed and manufactured by Quadpack. Made of 100% certified ash wood from sustainably-managed forests, the casing opens and closes with an intuitive gesture. The patented 'Solo Twist' system features an oval-shaped interior which ensures that the cap auto-locks on a quarter turn. ""The twist gesture is a departure from standard click closures, making it fresh and fun,"" said Quadpack in a statement. The lipstick is refillable with ease: consumers simply pull out the used mechanism and snap in the new one. It is also possible to use refills of different colours simultaneously with one single casing to further reduce the pack's impact. In addition, wood brings a natural touch and a specific sensory dimension to the pack. The entire pack is made in Europe. The mechanism is manufactured by Aptar beauty + home in Chavanod, France (formerly Aptar Reboul). Aptar Chavanod uses renewable energy, while 95% of production waste is reused or recycled. The wooden container – with PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification) or FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certification on demand – is made at Quadpack's wood factory in Catalonia, Spain, where a biomass plant converts production waste into energy. Both Aptar and Quadpack will commercialize the Iconic Woodacity lipstick, which will be showcased at: – LuxePack New York on 15-16 June 2022, on Quadpack stand (#B21), – MakeUp in Paris on 16-17 June 2022, on Aptar stand (#L30), – Paris Packaging Week's PCD on 29-30 June 2022, on Aptar stand (#L24) and Quadpack stand (#F18)."
"""Our goal is to keep plastic outside the environment,"" Xavier Joseph Aptar","On May 19, Xavier Joseph, Vice President of Global Marketing and Innovation at Aptar Beauty + Home, was a featured speaker during the ""Circular Economy"" session, together with Clemence Schmid, Executive Vice President Commercial Loop Global at TerraCycle, and Ben Patten, Good Club co-founder and CEO. ""We believe in keeping the plastic in the economy but outside the environment,"" said Xavier Joseph as an introduction. In order to reach this goal, Aptar is focusing on the creation of more sustainable product development through three main areas: recycled materials, recyclability and reusability. For instance Aptar Beauty + Home is focused on developing new mono-material solutions, such as Future, their fully recyclable mono-material pump, or on modifying existing ones with more recycled resins. For instance, the group has expanded its resin portfolio, with the new PCR Plus resin specifically designed for the cosmetic industry. Aptar's experts are also designing reloading systems such as long-lasting compact cases with reloading capabilities. Indeed, for Xavier Joseph, refillable or reloadable products are ""an opportunity to create new business models"". In Indonesia, Aptar partnered with Siklus a start-up that works at getting rid of disposable sachets that are common in Southeast Asia. Siklus operates mobile refill units from motor scooters: customers order and schedule delivery through the company's app or WhatsApp. They bring their own bottles or purchase one from Siklus, and the driver dispenses shampoo, detergent and other products from the back of a bike. Aptar conceived the valve that facilitates the dispensing of the products into the customer's own recipient. ""Sharing market knowledge for emerging trends, leveraging manufacturing, regulatory, R&D, and innovation expertise are essential to achieving a more circular economy. From leading brands to start-ups, our partners lean on us to provide them with recyclable, reusable or refillable models,"" shared Xavier Joseph. As a signatory of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's New Plastics Economy Global Commitment, Aptar committed to incorporate more recycled content into product offerings and have ttheir dispensing solutions for the beauty, personal care, home care, food and beverage markets be 100% reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. To achieve these commitments, the group continue to pursue initiatives to deploy best-in-class innovation practices and scout novel technologies developed by startups, to reach packaging industry's sustainability and circularity targets. ""The shift towards the circular economy is underway and we will not be able to resist such a powerful phenomenon. We have to move forward and create new business models, but that takes time, money and imagination! Fortunately, we are becoming more and more innovative in these areas and I am convinced that most of what will shape our future has not yet been invented. Our customers have ideas and our mission is to help them make their projects come true. This may involve some form of cooperation between the various market players, for example in order to define new standards,"" told Marc Prieur, President of Aptar Beauty + Home to Premium Beauty News."
"""It's a thrill to have the trade shows back,"" Josh Brooks, Paris Packaging Week","Premium Beauty News - First scheduled for January, the 2022 edition of the threefold ADF, PCD and PLD trade show will finally take place at the end of June under a new identity: the Paris Packaging Week. What is the reason for this name change? Josh Brooks – In addition to the name change, we have also modified the entire graphic identity of our three consumer goods packaging events in London, Paris and Milan. Each of these three events is made up of different complementary ""building blocks"": ADF, PCD and PLD in Paris, Packaging Première, PCD, PLD and Food & Consumer Pack, in London, for example. We entrusted this image and name change to the London-based design agency Butterfly Cannon, which has expertise in the premium and luxury sectors. The aim was to reflect both the expertise and the passion of players in this sector. The new identity stands as a coherent offer for both brands and suppliers and meets the expectations of a community of professionals who are keen to be connected and benefit from increased visibility in the packaging innovation markets. It will allow us to accelerate the synergies between the three events, for the benefit of our exhibitors. Premium Beauty News - So, what is the outlook for this Paris edition? Josh Brooks - The feedback is very good! We can see that exhibitors and visitors are really enthusiastic. They are all looking forward to meeting up again, to see first-hand what the market has to offer. The number of exhibitors will be the same as at the last face-to-face event, with almost 650 exhibitors. On the visitor side, pre-registration rates are extremely promising and we are even ahead of the figures usually recorded at this stage of the event. We expect about 10,000 participants over the two days of the Paris Packaging Week. Premium Beauty News - What are the main assets of the Paris Packaging Week? Josh Brooks - Undoubtedly the first asset is Paris! We are at the heart of the global luxury industry. Several groups - such as L'Oréal, LVMH, Chanel or Puig - send more than 100, or sometimes more than 200 people to the show. For our exhibitors, this is an opportunity to meet entire teams. This is something we can see very clearly in the profile of visitors: 50% of them come from the Paris region. But Paris is also an attractive spot at the European level and we record 30% of international visitors. Another major asset is our very comprehensive and unparalleled programme of conferences and events! Each of the three components of the Paris Packaging Week will have its dedicated conference room, i.e., three specific conference rooms. Various showrooms (Pentawards, student projects, Innovation Awards) and prize-giving ceremonies will also allow us to promote the innovations of the high-end packaging sector. Finally, we will also provide several informal and networking areas that give our event this unique atmosphere! The Champagne Bar and Cocktail Bar, as well as the first day's evening party, are ideal for creating links and sharing moments in a relaxed atmosphere. Premium Beauty News - Precisely what will be the highlights of this edition? Christelle Anya - The Paris Packaging Week is a place to enrich your network but above all a place to get information from experts and to identify what's best in terms of packaging today. We have devised a highly diverse programme of events, conferences and exhibitions to meet the very high expectations of visitors who are only too eager to meet up again. The show will allow brands to discover the best in terms of environmental approach, eco-design, recyclability, bio-sourced materials, refill solutions... Sustainable development will be a hot topic, and several conferences, including the opening conference for the PCD Awards ceremony by Franck Marilly, President and CEO of Shiseido Europe, will address this topic. An Ecotour will allow participants to take a guided tour of innovations in the field of eco-responsibility to help brans owners create the perfect packaging in line with their product and their CSR commitments. There is also an exclusive meeting organised between Michel Fontaine, President of the CNE (Conseil National de l'Emballage) and Jacques Playe, Global Head of Packaging and Product Development at L'Oréal. Also worth mentioning are the two student contests launched in partnership with cosmetic brands: the 6th edition of the ESEPAC/ESP Student Competition sponsored by Estée Lauder Companies, which challenged students to reflect on the reinvention of luxury perfume consumer experiences, and the first edition of the ESIReims student contest, with Shiseido and HudaBeauty, where young engineers were asked to completely reinvent a palette of 18 shades by making it refillable and recyclable or to rethink the secondary packaging of the brand's flagship perfume ""Kayali"" by integrating eco-design and industrialisation into the project, or to revisit the WASO range dedicated to the GEN Z. This year's edition of the Paris Packaging Week will be rich in meetings, discoveries and innovations, a place where brand owners and their teams will be able to discover eco-responsible and disruptive solutions, at the heart of trends!"
Five key packaging innovations spotted at Cosmopack Bologna,"Asquan has showcased the Essential Push Button Tottle, a 30ml refillable unit with an integrated 'spring' that dispenses out of the nozzle by depressing the tottle body from the end. There are two available size offerings of nozzle orifice (1.2mm & 2mm) to match a wide variety of formula viscosities. The tottle + nozzle refill unit snaps in and out of the outer housing for an easy and intuitive refill story. The packaging is entirely made of PP (except for the nozzle, which is TPE). The outer housing and cap are suitable for various decorative processes including vacuum metallization, silk screen, soft touch, and spray decoration. Berlin Packaging has introduced Airglass Jar, a collection of refillable airless glass jars available in 30 and 50 ml sizes. The concept allows consumers to reuse the jar many times by changing the refill jar in a few simple steps. Made of glass with PP and PETG components, these jars can be completely disassembled, allowing the consumer to recycle the components by material. Awarded at the end of 2021 by the Italian Association for Design (ADI, Associazione per il Designo Industriale), Lumson's paper airless dispenser offers a lighter and greener alternative to plastic, glass or aluminium. Actually, XPaper is an airless pouch technology in which the outershell is in cardboard. When dispensing the formulation, the pouch is squeezed, allowing a precise dose of product to be dispensed, without any air returning into the package. The airless pouch technology ensures maximum and hygienic preservation of the skincare or makeup formulas. When the product is finished, the consumer can easily separate the plastic components from the paper and recycle each part in the appropriate way. Mktg Industry continues to bet on paperboard with refillable packaging solutions for sticks and lipsticks. The company's eco- friendly collection of refillable packaging features two new items: Lipstick GEA REFILL and Sticks GEA REFILL with cardboard/paper base, plastic inside mechanism, plastic sleeve easy to be removed and exchanged and cardboard/paper cap to allow a plastic reduction up to 75%. According to Mktg Industry, ""this easy-to-use refillable system allows to simply separate the plastic mechanism that contains the formula and replacing it with a new one that can be sold separately."" The GEA REFILL solutions are Mktg Industry's answer to the increasing leaning of a zero-waste beauty world. MYC Packaging Innovation unveiled a mascara packaging with a smart design to combine sustainability with luxury. Refill Me mascara is a high-end mascara case that can be reused and refilled again, and again thanks to an intuitive refillable system: when the mascara refill is finished, one's just has to pull out the cap, unscrew the collar, pull out the cartridge and insert a new one. The empty refill can be recycled. The concept is suitable for mascara as well as lash and eyebrow treatment, it can be easily tailored also for lip and face products."
